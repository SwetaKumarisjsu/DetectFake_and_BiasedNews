20001,20001,Rasmussen: 57 Percent Support a Temporary Ban on Refugees From Terror-Exporting Countries - Breitbart,Katie McHugh,"A strong majority of voters support a temporary ban on refugees from unstable and violent countries, Rasmussen Reports found. [Nearly   of voters want the U. S. government to halt refugee resettlement until better controls to screen foreigners can be implemented, according to Rasmussen:  A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 57 percent of Likely U. S. Voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen until the federal government approves its ability to screen out potential terrorists form coming here.   percent are opposed, while 10 percent are undecided. Similarly, 56 percent favor a temporary block on visas prohibiting residents of Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the United States until the government approves its ability to screen for likely terrorists.   percent oppose this temporary ban, and 11 percent are undecided. The   survey questions do not mention President Trump’s executive action issued on Friday: “Do you favor or oppose a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen until the federal government improves its ability to screen out potential terrorists from coming here?” “Do you favor or oppose a temporary block on visas prohibiting residents of Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from entering the United States until the federal government improves its ability to screen out potential terrorists from coming here?” Public sentiment is largely unchanged from August, when 59 percent of likely voters wanted a temporary immigration moratorium placed on countries who export terrorism. In September, 59 percent opposed failed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s plan to dramatically increase the importation of Syrian refugees, while only 25 percent approved. Another poll conducted in August found only 36 percent of voters wanted to import thousands of Syrian refugees, including only 18 percent of Republicans. These numbers reflect the broader public mood on extreme immigration levels. For example, another   poll found 54 percent of voters would like to see immigration levels halved or reduced to zero. Another 58 percent think illegal aliens should not be allowed to stay in the U. S. at all. Rasmussen questioned 1, 000 likely voters from Jan. 25 to Jan. 26, with margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.",0
20002,20002,VIDEO: Cop Crashes Car and Runs Away When More Cops Arrive,Ryan Banister,"
An award-winning California state trooper was caught on camera fleeing the scene after crashing his patrol car into a parked vehicle and a utility pole, snapping it in half, on Thursday afternoon at 2:30 p.m.
When other officers approached and asked him to explain what happened, officer Daniel Kenney refused to get out of the vehicle. With at least three officers surrounding the front end of the car, Kenney reverses and then speeds away past a cameraman across the street.
Kenney, a state park K-9 officer, is now on paid administrative leave.

Nearly 1,000 homes and business in the area were left without power.
Officers placed Kenney in handcuffs when he eventually decided to pull over. He was taken to a hospital where it was determined that he was not intoxicated.
A man inside the parked vehicle which Kenney struck suffered minor injuries and was taken to the hospital, according to Action News Now. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

20003,20003,Why Does Fall Foliage Turn So Red and Fiery? It Depends. - The New York Times,JoAnna Klein,"Leaves scream their final cries in color before dropping to the ground. Their shouts  —   in golden, crimson or scarlet  —   eventually fade to brown bellows, and their lifeless bodies dry up on the forest floor. It absorbs their crinkly corpses and that’s it  —   worm food. The fall of a leaf in autumn is an orchestrated death. A complex, brilliant, beautiful death. Right now across the United States, fall foliage season is peaking, and everyone’s out to get a peep at the fiery show. Hiking trails are crowded. Mountain roads are packed, and leaf cams are getting lots of love. When you think of it as watching the death of leaves, it sounds morbid, but it’s captivating nonetheless. Does the way some turn red in the process serve any purpose? Leaves actually start out yellow. Chlorophyll, the chemical responsible for giving leaves their green appearance and converting light to energy during photosynthesis, just overpowers it in the spring and summer. But when temperature, daylight and weather events like rain or drought cause leaves to die in the fall, chlorophyll breaks down and reveals the yellow or orange helper chemicals known as carotenes or carotenoids that were there all along. Red is another story, because it’s made on purpose. As some leaves die, they produce chemicals called anthocyanins (also found in the skin of grapes and apples) from built up sugars. These chemicals produce a red pigment that can combine with green pigments left from chlorophyll and display different shades of red. How bright this red is depends on what species the leaf belongs to, its inherent genetics and the environment around it  —   including the forest, the tree, and individual leaves, said John Silander, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at The University of Connecticut. But with the chemical explanation out of the way, the question still remains: Why do some leaves use precious energy to turn red right before dying? There are a handful of evolutionary explanations, Dr. Silander said, but many of them sound contradictory. According to a 2007 paper published in The Botanical Review, red and yellow fall leaves could be flashing arrows that attract birds and mammals to a tree’s fruits. Animals that stop by for a bite will then do what animals do, dispersing the seeds as they go, thereby aiding in the species’ survival. On the other hand, colored leaves could work like the wings of the monarch butterfly, warning others about   defensive poisons or chemicals that tend to be in red leaves. But this could be wrong, too. Pests laying eggs in the fall might prefer drab plants rather than bright ones, leaving the bright ones to survive. “It may be an ‘I’m   don’t bother’ signal to potential insects, pests, or parasites that they should look elsewhere,” Kerissa Battle, a community science educator at Community Greenways Collaborative, wrote in an email. But then again, she said, the red color could also signal that a leaf is on its way out, and there’s not much healthy stuff left to eat before it drops. With these and other contradictory hypotheses, what else could explain all that red foliage? Robert Guy, a professor of forestry at the University of British Columbia, suggested it could have something to do with the autumn sun. While it doesn’t appear to be true in all trees, red probably works like a sunshade in maple trees. Abby van den Berg, an ecologist at the University of Vermont, found that protecting leaves from sun damage lets them do important stuff on their way out, like sending nutrients back into the tree to store for later use. If something goes wrong during this critical process, the whole tree suffers. This is also why new buds are also often red  —   that’s another critical time when a tree needs to avoid sun damage. “Protection from bright light (and probably UV light as well) during the process of leaf senescence is the best explanation for why the leaves of some trees turn red in autumn” Dr. Guy wrote in an email. So when you go out and watch thousands of leaves absorb sunlight one last time, keep this in mind: They didn’t die in vain.",0
20004,20004,Trump’s National Security Adviser: “Islam is a Political Ideology… Hides behind this Notion of it being a Religion”!,MM,"by Onan Coca, Freedom OutPost : 
In a speech from August that is now making waves across the country, president-elect Donald Trump’s National Security Adviser designate, Lt. General Michael Flynn (retired) told the Dallas chapter of ACT! For America that “Islam is a political ideology, it is a political ideology. It definitely hides behind this notion of it being a religion.” 
The comments are sure to be brought back up when Flynn goes before the Senate to testify during his confirmation hearings. However, Flynn’s personality and his public persona lead me to believe that he’s not worried about facing tough questions from hostile Democrat Senators. 
In his speech, Flynn further commented on the differences between Christianity and Islam before making some even more controversial comments about world Islam today. 
“Islam is a political ideology, it is a political ideology. It definitely hides behind this notion of it being a religion. I have a very, very tough time because I don’t see a lot of people screaming ‘Jesus Christ’ with hatchetsor machetes or rifles shooting up clubs or hatcheting, literally axing families on a train. 
Or like they just killed a couple of police officers with a machete. I mean, it’s unbelievable. So we have a problem. 
It’s like cancer. I’ve gone through cancer in my own life. And so it’s like cancer, and it’s like a malignant cancer, though in this case that has metastasized. 
It’s like I just said in the number of attacks in 22 countries in just the last 45 days. When I look back over the last 10 years or 15 years of my life and the things that I’ve seen and the things that I’ve witnessed against this very vicious threat. 
The folks at MRC TV cut video of Flynn’s speech with an interview he gave to MSNBC where the topic of discussion was Russia. In the interview Flynn explains why the current liberal stance towards Russia is all wrong – while Russia may not be a “good guy” in the narrative, they’re certainly preferable to the Muslim terrorists that we’re both fighting against. 
“We have to deal with Russia,” he said. “We cannot make Russia an enemy. Russia is a nation that is deeply involved in the Middle East. Right now, the Middle East is totally unstable. We have over 5,000 of our own troops there in Iraq trying to fight the rise of ISIS.” 
“Russia’s directly involved,” he said. “So we have to figure out ways to work with them instead of making them an antagonist.”",1

20006,20006,Daily Mail Editor Triggers Article 50,chrisf,"November 8, 2016 
Notoriously mild-mannered editor of the Daily Mail, Paul Dacre, made his move to trigger Article 50 today, arguing that 49 articles about Brexit in his paper each day just wasn’t enough to get his message across. 
‘We’ve tried everything. ‘Take a Bow Britain’, ‘Enemies of the People’, ‘You’re all a bunch of European-loving t****’, noted Dacre placidly. ‘However, some people remain unconvinced by the softly-softly, measured, evidence based headline-making that is our hallmark. It’s time for more drastic measures.’ 
All features in the paper will now be expected to have a Brexit angle, with the exception of the daily filler piece on the dangers of statins, for which copy is already in the can for at least the next five years. 
Early sightings of tomorrow’s paper reveal a front-pager on the big overnight news from the US, revealing ‘Meghan Markle looking Supreme, that’s the Judgement of everyone, as she looks for a quick Brexit back to Stateside’. Crossword answers must now be drawn from a series of approved words, which include Brexit, May, Article 50, invoke, the, people, have, spoken, timetable, for, exit, now, now and NOW! The regular free garden seeds promotion will feature a new ‘sovereign Brtain’ bloom which the paper hopes will blossom ‘sometime in 2017′, but which the planting notes caution will need much attention and care from May. 
Some at the paper are said to be uncomfortable with Dacre’s new editorial policy, but they know that arguing with him is ultimately a futile exercise. ‘Colleagues say that likes to impose his will on the paper’, said one insider. ‘At least that’s what I think they meant when they talked about that big cock on the Mail.’   8th, 2016 by chrisf   chrisf   UK News 0",1
20007,20007,Trump Tower Climber Snatched by Police as the Internet Watches - The New York Times,Eli Rosenberg and Megan Jula,"A lone man’s climb up the side of Trump Tower became a New York City spectacle on Wednesday afternoon after thousands watched his ascent in real time on television, through social media and in person. The man was pulled off the building’s facade and apprehended by police officers who had removed a glass panel on the 21st floor about three hours into his climb. By then, he had become a social media sensation, as people watched live videos posted on Facebook and Periscope, a live   app. A stream on Facebook from   in New York received more than four million views, and people commented along with the action. Clad in shorts and a   the climber began to scale the building around 3:30 p. m. the police said, wearing a harness and using what appeared to be suction cups to aid his climb. William Aubry, the New York Police Department’s assistant chief of the Manhattan South detective squad, told reporters that the man was a    from Virginia who had told them he sought to scale the tower with one purpose: to gain a personal meeting with Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee. Police officials said he told them about a YouTube video he posted on Tuesday that explained his motives. In the widely shared video that matched the police’s description, titled “Message to Mr. Trump (why I climbed your tower),” a hooded man claimed he was an “independent researcher. ” “Believe me, if my purpose was not significant, I would not risk my life pursuing it,” the man said solemnly. “The reason I climbed your tower was to get your attention. ” Police did not release the name of the man, whom they took to Bellevue Hospital Center for an evaluation. On Wednesday night, Mr. Trump expressed his appreciation for the police on Twitter, writing, “Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber. ” Livestreaming, which increasingly draws wide audiences, has helped turn the outlandish happenings that occur periodically in a place like New York into viral public events. In June, a broadcast primarily seen on Periscope of a naked man whom the police described as “emotionally disturbed” became a similar public spectacle. With the climber’s image being broadcast  —   and commented on  —   far and wide on Wednesday, the man perched, if only briefly, at the intersection of two unpredictable worlds: the combustible presidential campaign and the chaotic city beneath him. The climb and frenzy that followed were also the latest instance in which Trump Tower has starred in a noteworthy role during the campaign. The building on Fifth Avenue, the site of Mr. Trump’s campaign launch and his residence, has prompted some of the same strong emotions as those inspired by the candidate himself. It has been a magnet for those making political statements: a protester in a Ku Klux   hood who tussled with security guards in September 200 marchers in December   activists in the spring. It has also been the site of a zoning tussle, magnified by the stakes of the presidential election, after the Trump Organization was forced to remove a Trump kiosk from its lobby, which had been designated as a public space as part of an agreement that allowed the developer to add 20 stories to the building’s height. And it has burnished its status as a tourist attraction, drawing more than one million visitors every year from around the globe. On Wednesday, hundreds of people gawked from the streets below, filming the climb with cameras and phones, oohing after the man dropped an object. Some cheered for him, remarking on the difficulty of his climb. “You will never believe what I just saw,” a woman leaving the commotion said into her cellphone. Aaron Hesseltine, 17, in town with his family from Saranac Lake, N. Y. to see Alex Rodriguez’s last game with the Yankees, watched for an hour and a half, documenting the experience on Snapchat for his friends at home. His last missive showed the moment the climber disappeared into the opening. ”They got him,” it read.",0
20008,20008,"Trump, Sessions, Pompeo, Flynn: Your Friday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",Karen Zraick and Sandra Stevenson,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.   Donald Trump has chosen three hawkish loyalists for key posts. They are Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Representative Mike Pompeo as C. I. A. director and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser. All three are regarded as outliers from conventional Republican thinking, shunned in various ways for viewpoints that were seen as unacceptable or overly partisan. Mr. Sessions, an Alabama conservative, was denied a federal judgeship by the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1986 because of racially charged comments. Mr. Pompeo, above, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, would become one of the most overtly partisan figures to take over the C. I. A.  —   a spy agency that, at least publicly, is supposed to operate above politics and avoid a direct role in policymaking. General Flynn was the angry voice of the national security establishment on the campaign trail. He describes Islam as a political ideology, not a religion, and has even called it a cancer. ____ 2. Mr. Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle lawsuits stemming from his defunct   education venture, Trump University. Fraud allegations by former students had dogged him for years and hampered his presidential campaign. Above, Mr. Trump announced the establishment of the university in 2005. ____ 3. The World Health Organization declared an end to its global health emergency over the spread of the Zika virus. Zika should now be treated as a continuing problem rather than an exceptional situation, the agency said. The move prompted dismay from some public health experts, especially because Zika is seasonal and summer is just starting in the Southern Hemisphere. Above, a baby born with microcephaly in Brazil. ____ 4. Confederate flags are being displayed across the country, often as a kind of rejoinder to   protesters. Those who have publicly embraced the flag are a small minority of the more than 60 million Americans who voted for Mr. Trump. But  displays of the flag  —   and reports of threats and attacks directed at minorities  —   are forcing Americans to confront vexing questions about race relations. ____ 5. A     windowless, fortified ATT building in downtown Manhattan has been identified as an N. S. A. listening post. Neither ATT nor the National Security Agency would confirm this, but that’s the conclusion of a short film debuting this weekend, based on material provided by Edward Snowden. The film, “Project X,” says the building was   Titanpointe and used to collect communications from international entities with operations in New York. ____ 6. In a new study, scientists using genetic engineering techniques were able to alter photosynthesis, the chemical reaction powering nearly all life on Earth. They increased the productivity of a test plant by 20 percent, raising hopes that they could do the same with food crops. Above, rice seedlings that are part of the experiment in a lab at the University of Illinois. ____ 7. Mr. Trump’s election has upended French politics and given new momentum to the far right. But it could also propel an aging, generally unpopular   politician into the presidency. Alain Juppé is the   heading into a party primary this Sunday. He’s seen as a bulwark against rising populism. ____ 8. Pope Francis’ third set of cardinals will receive their “red hats” at a ceremony on Saturday. Most of the current cardinals were appointed by his more conservative predecessors. The    pontiff is in a race against time to appoint enough   cardinals to ensure that his vision of the church endures after he dies. ___ 9. Pirates are sowing terror along the Amazon River in Brazil. Robberies and boat hijackings have surged as local drug gangs grow stronger. The police are struggling to respond. “There’s no law on the Amazon River,” said one woman whose son was robbed. ____ 10. Here are eight new books we recommend this week. From Wesley Lowery’s reportage on police shootings to Zadie Smith’s new novel, they elucidate and offer escape from the noisy politics of our times. ____ 11. Finally, we built an interactive meal planner for Thanksgiving. Tell us how many guests are coming, their dietary needs and your culinary dreams. In return, we’ll offer recipe ideas and tips for an extraordinary Thanksgiving meal.

20009,20009,Gardasil Vaccine Given without Consent and Ruins Life of 14 Year Old Girl,Admin - Orissa,"Gardasil Vaccine Given without Consent and Ruins Life of 14 Year Old Girl Savannah with her mother Sarah Snyder. 
Health Impact News 
The VAXXED film crew continues interviewing people who are vaccine damaged around the country. 
In this interview in Nebraska, 14 year old Savannah Snyder is interviewed along with her mother Sarah. 
Savannah talks about her experiences in receiving her 7th grade required vaccines. Her mother Sarah explains that she only gave permission for Savannah to receive the required vaccines. Gardasil, the HPV vaccine, is an optional vaccine. Sarah explains that she had been warned about this vaccine and wanted to investigate it further. 
You believe your doctor. Every parent believes their doctor. We’re all trying to do the right thing. 
But Savannah was given the Gardasil vaccine anyway, without their original knowledge. She immediately started suffering some side effects, such as a headache, almost fainting, and skin rashes breaking out. She soon developed pneumonia and other infections. 
As time went on, things got worse. She started experiencing seizures, including grand mal seizures. She was hospitalized many times for severe pain. Her mother tearfully explains that Savannah would wake up in the middle of the night and state that she was dying. 
Like many other parents of children with Gardasil injuries, Sarah relates how they had little support, and that most people just thought it was all in Savannah’s head. 
But after a trip to the Mayo clinic, Savannah was diagnosed with POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome), a known side effect of Gardasil that affects the heart. (See: Cardiologist Comments on New Study Linking HPV Vaccines to POTS ) 
Savannah explains that before the Gardasil shot, she was very active and athletic. She was in the process of joining a gym. Now, she has difficulties speaking and walking, and needs a feeding tube.

Medical Doctors Opposed to Forced Vaccinations – Should Their Views be Silenced? eBook – Available for immediate download. 
One of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all “quacks.” 
However, nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate. Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding “the science” of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines. 
The two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all, and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary. 
Very few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field. 
In between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves “pro-vaccine,” for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual. 
Many doctors recommend a “delayed” vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot. 
These doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions. 
In this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

20010,20010,Kushner Family Apologizes for Mentioning Jared’s Name at EB-5 Visa Investor Meeting in China - Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,"Nicole Kushner Meyer is apologizing for mentioning her brother, Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser and    to President Donald Trump, during an investment conference in China over the weekend. [“In 2008, my brother Jared Kushner joined the family company as CEO, and recently moved to Washington to join the administration,” Meyer said at the conference aimed at encouraging Chinese developers to invest in a New Jersey real estate project, according to CNN.  On Monday, Kushner Companies said Meyer’s remarks were not meant to motivate investors to sign onto the real estate project. “Ms. Meyer wanted to make clear that her brother had stepped away from the company in January and has nothing to do with this project,” the company said in a statement. Meyer never mentioned the president’s name during the investor event, but Trump’s photo was seen in a slide at the conference that detailed the “key decision makers” on the   program, CNN reports. Kushner Companies distanced itself from the photo Monday, insisting that the image “was part of a presentation by the event’s organizers. ” “Kushner Companies had nothing to do with it,” the company said. The   visa program encourages wealthy foreign nationals to make substantial investments in U. S.  business ventures in exchange for a Green Card and a investor visa. Saturday’s event was hosted by Qiaowai, a Chinese company seeking funding for the Kushner 1 project in New Jersey. Reuters reports that journalists were “barred” from the event. Reporters were barred from a Kushner Companies event that offered Chinese investors a chance to get   visas: https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   Reuters Top News (@Reuters) May 8, 2017,  The program has come under intense scrutiny by both Republicans and Democrats. California Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein opposes the   visa program, arguing that it allows monied foreign nationals to use their wealth to buy visas and U. S. citizenship. The program  —   which was extended and sneakily slipped into the latest spending bill  —   is rife with abuse, leading to fraud convictions.

20011,20011,Homeopathy in the NHS: The Big Debate,Nick Huxsted,"Keywords: complimentary medicine , holistic health , homeopathy , nhs 
The Department for Health is currently reviewing whether or not homeopathy in the NHS should continue to be available through doctor referrals. Against a backdrop of funding cuts and increasing pressure to reduce costs, the Government and health managers are looking at whether to add homeopathy to the NHS’s “schedule 1” blacklist, a selection of products that NHS doctors are banned from prescribing. 
However despite consistent claims that there is a lack of quality evidence into the positive health benefits of homeopathy, the NHS has spent more than £1.75m on homeopathic treatments over the last 10 years, and any proposed ban is likely to have its fair share of detractors. 
Almost six million Brits seek the help complementary and alternative medicine (of which homeopathy is a part) with one in four wanting access to be universally available through the NHS. 
The lead argument for the exclusion of homeopathic treatment is lack of evidence that supports its effectiveness, with research often being labeled as “inconclusive”. However proponents for the inclusion of homeopathy argue that this doesn’t necessarily mean that there is no evidence. 
Dr Helen Beaumont, a GP and the president of the Faculty of Homeopathy, has recently stated that homeopathic treatment has a “profound effect” on patients. 
“It’s disappointing that at a time when the NHS is facing a funding crisis the Department of Health is embarking on a costly consultation that could prevent highly skilled clinicians prescribing a course of treatment that benefits thousands of patients each year. If the department were serious about saving money surely it should be looking at SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) prescribed for mild to moderate depression in vast quantities at considerable cost to the NHS, but which studies have found to be ineffective for those conditions.” 
George Freeman, the minister for life sciences, has stated that in a time of rising demand, the government has a duty to ensure NHS funds are spent only on the most effective treatments. However an article in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) that examined the scientific evidence behind NHS treatments, found that 46% of 2,500 commonly used NHS treatments are of unknown effectiveness, and only 13% are known to be beneficial. The argument is being made that the principals being applied to homeopathy, are consistent for all forms of treatments throughout the NHS. 
Collating research itself has also proved to be difficult, with the positive effects of homeopathy often a challenge to fully quantify. The NHS is driven by targets and trial evidence using hard data (like death and disease) to determine the effectiveness of a particular treatment. Researching and recording a patients quality of life, happiness and emotional satisfaction has always been much more difficult to quantify, but a wealth of anecdotal evidence and studies from other European countries continue to support the use of homeopathic treatment. 
For example, in 2008, over a hundred homeopathic GP practices in Germany and Switzerland took up the challenge (1) of demonstrating the health of “chronically ill patients after eight years of homeopathic treatment”. It concluded that homeopathy is clinically effective, cost-effective and safe – with the results playing an important role in the inclusion of homeopathy as part of their national healthcare scheme. 
Similarly the largest study at Bristol Homeopathic Hospital (2) followed the effectiveness of homeopathy on 6,500 consecutive patients over a six-year period. 70% of follow-up patients reported improved health with 50% reporting major improvement. 
The debate whether homeopathy in the NHS will no doubt continue. The homeopathic profession has had to face increasing criticism and hostility over recent years, but with an average annual spend of £152,000 on homeopathic treatment (the equivalent of 0.0013% of the total NHS drug budget) it should be remembered that if these patients were not treated with homeopathic medicines, they would have to be treated by other NHS departments with potentially more expensive, conventional drugs.

20013,20013,Gauis Publius: TPP Has Picked Up a Powerful Enemy — Black Lives Matter,Yves Smith,"Mark Warner, Virginia Ron Wyden, Oregon 
In both houses of Congress, these were the barest of margins — 218 Yes votes in the House and 60 Yes votes in the Senate, in each case exactly the minimum required for passage. Another indication of how toxic this “trade” bill is. No Democrat dared touch it who didn’t want to or have to. 
Black Lives Matter and the TPP 
And now the TPP has become even more toxic, since the Black Lives Matter (BLM) social-justice movement has endorsed the anti-TPP position. Politico Pro has this (sub. required; my emphasis): 
Obama’s latest TPP foe: Black Lives Matter By Andrew Hanna Monday, Oct. 31, 2016 
The Obama administration will face an unexpected adversary as it gears up for what could be a blockbuster lame-duck fight over the Trans-Pacific Partnership: the Black Lives Matter movement. 
The group — best known best for its protests of police shootings of African-Americans — has joined the fray over the Asian Pacific trade deal as part of its growing focus on economic issues, contending the pact would lead to greater racial injustice . It ties past trade deals to the closures of factories that have hurt black workers disproportionately and increased black poverty . 
Its involvement could influence the votes of a handful of wavering Democrats, should Congress tackle TPP during the lame duck. 
“There are groups that are going to pay a lot of close attention to what they say, especially the Congressional Black Caucus,” said Bill Reinsch, a fellow at the Stimson Center and close trade-vote watcher. 
Only a small band of 28 House Democrats voted to give the president fast track authority to complete TPP, including three members of the Congressional Black Caucus: Reps. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Texas) and Terri Sewell (D-Ala.). A fourth black caucus member, Republican Mia Love of Utah, also voted for fast-track authority. 
With anti-trade fervor whipped into a fever pitch by the presidential election campaign, their votes are considered key to passage of the pact — and all are under increasing pressure to abandon the president should the pact come to a ratification vote. 
The pretend reason, of course, for TPP support is support for a major legacy “want” by the first black president. The pro-Clinton members of the Democratic Platform Committee, for example, resisted to the end any explicit language about TPP on the grounds that the Party must support its president. 
Democrats Prioritize Party Unity Over Including Stand Against TPP In Platform 
Members of the Democratic National Convention Platform Committee shot down an attempt to include specific opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal in the platform, despite the fact that both Democratic presidential candidates have taken positions against the TPP. 
The attempt failed because members appointed by Hillary Clinton and DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz claimed it was improper to oppose the TPP when President Barack Obama fervently believes in the agreement. However, by putting party unity before taking a firm stand against the trade agreement, the door was left open for Clinton to go back to supporting the TPP , which was the case when she was secretary of state. 
“It is hard for me to understand why Secretary Clinton’s delegates won’t stand behind Secretary Clinton’s positions in the party’s platform,” Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said…. 
Even platform committee chair, Representative E.J. Cummings [normally progressive on trade issues], chose to vote against the resolution. He, too, bragged about not voting for trade agreements. 
“I don’t want to do anything as he ends his term to undercut the president of the United States. I’m just not going to do it. And that’s where I stand,” Cummings proclaimed. 
That’s the pretend reason — supporting the first black president — for most of them anyway. The real reason is different and not unexpected — money and everything money can buy. The Democratic Party as it’s currently configured exists to enable the fire hose flow of corporate and big-wealth dollars into its coffers. Opposing that flow gets you the “Sanders treatment,” but I’m not spilling any new beans in saying that. 
This move by Black Lives Matter takes away the pretend reason and thus puts some careers at risk. BLM has high visibility at the moment. It will be worth watching the result, the actual TPP vote, as this plays out later. 
What to Watch For in the Lame Duck 
Once the Democrats figure out how many Republicans will defect from their leadership in each house of Congress (there were 50 House Republican defections last time plus six not voting, and five Senate defections plus two not voting), they’ll know how many Democrats will have to “take one for the team” — vote Yes on TPP so others with reputations to protect (like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ) don’t have to. 
The numbers needed to pass TPP in the Senate have changed this time. Only 51 votes are needed there now (that’s part of what “fast track” means). Finding 50 No votes in the Senate is not an impossible task, but it’s a very high bar — depending on the way Republicans vote, as few as four “Democrats” like Ron Wyden could guarantee passage. 
So the greatest vulnerability for TPP is in the House . Can Democrats again muster something like 28 pro-corporate votes? Which Democrats will chose to take the fall a second time? Corporatists like Ron Kind will eagerly comply. But will Earl Blumenauer ( bow-tie bicycle guy )? Will CBC members Sewell and Johnson, with BLM lobbying hard against them? Or will other House Democrats be needed (and willing) to take the fall so Pelosi can move TPP across the line? 
Again, Fast Track passed the House with zero votes to spare. What if the Republican opposition — including the opposition to Speaker Ryan in the wake of the Trump debacle — swells to more than 50? This could be a very close vote. 
TPP, Obama’s Legacy and “A Glide Path to His Life as an Ex-President” 
The Politico article quoted above helpfully notes this about Obama’s legacy: 
If successfully pushed through Congress, ratification of the trade accord would be the last major piece of legislation of the Obama presidency. The prospect that black lawmakers and activists could help to hand him a defeat is complicated by Obama’s position as the first black president. 
“ This is part of President Obama’s legacy ,” said [CBC member Gregory] Meeks. 
Will Barack Obama get his legacy wish, along with his legacy library and foundation? The New York Times a few weeks ago told us this about Obama’s future plans and needs: 
Publicly, Mr. Obama betrays little urgency about his future. Privately, he is preparing for his postpresidency with the same fierce discipline and fund-raising ambition that characterized the 2008 campaign that got him to the White House. 
The long-running dinner this past February is part of a methodical effort taking place inside and outside the White House as the president, first lady and a cadre of top aides map out a postpresidential infrastructure and endowment they estimate could cost as much as $1 billion . The president’s aides did not ask any of the guests for library contributions after the dinner, but a number of those at the table could be donors in the future…. 
So far, Mr. Obama has raised just over $5.4 million from 12 donors, with gifts ranging from $100,000 to $1 million. Michael J. Sacks, a Chicago businessman, gave $666,666. Fred Eychaner, the founder of Chicago-based Newsweb Corp., which owns community newspapers and radio stations, donated $1 million. Mark T. Gallogly, a private equity executive, and James H. Simons, a technology entrepreneur, each contributed $340,000 to a foundation set up to oversee development of the library. 
The real push for donations, foundation officials said, will come after Mr. Obama leaves the White House . 
Shailagh Murray, a senior adviser, oversees an effort inside the White House to keep attention on Mr. Obama’s future and to ensure that his final 17 months in office, barring crises, serve as a glide path to his life as an ex-president . 
“A glide path to his life as an ex-president.” I guess you could call him, after his 2008 trademark, “ever hopeful and looking for change” Interesting times indeed. 0 0 0 0 0 0",1
20014,20014,NPR Journalist and Translator Killed by Taliban in Afghanistan - The New York Times,Rod Nordland,"KABUL, Afghanistan  —   An American journalist for NPR was killed on Sunday afternoon along with his Afghan translator in a Taliban ambush in southern Afghanistan, the Afghan military confirmed. NPR also confirmed their deaths on Sunday. The victims were identified as David Gilkey, a photographer and videographer who was part of a   NPR team embedded with Afghan Special Forces in Helmand Province, and his translator, Zabihullah Tamanna. The other two American journalists on the team were unhurt. Mr. Gilkey was the first civilian American journalist killed during the    Afghan conflict since 1992, at least 27 journalists have been killed in Afghanistan, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In 2010, James P. Hunter, a staff sergeant and journalist with the 101st Airborne Division, was killed by an improvised explosive device. The journalists were in a   special forces convoy driving on the main road from Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand Province, to Marja when Taliban insurgents fired at the convoy with heavy weapons, said Shakil Ahmad, the spokesman for the Afghan National Army’s 215th Corps in Helmand. The vehicle carrying Mr. Gilkey and Mr. Tamanna was destroyed, Mr. Ahmad said. It was not immediately clear where the other two NPR journalists were at the time of the attack. After a heavy firefight, the Afghan government forces recovered the victims’ bodies and retreated to a nearby Afghan police base, Mr. Ahmad said. The bodies were then flown to Camp Bastion, the corps headquarters, which was once the major American and British base in Helmand, late Sunday. Mr. Gilkey was an   journalist who had extensive experience covering conflicts in Gaza, South Africa, Iraq, the Balkans and Afghanistan. After he covered the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Mr. Gilkey talked about his profession in a video. “It’s not just reporting. It’s not just taking pictures,” he said. “It’s do those visuals, do the stories, do they change somebody’s mind enough to take action?” The NPR team’s most recent report, Thursday on the network’s “Morning Edition” program, described American Army Special Forces troops working with their Afghan counterparts and using drones to hunt Taliban insurgents. Mr. Gilkey’s photographs accompanied an online version of the report. The last foreign journalist killed in Afghanistan was Anja Niedringhaus, a German citizen and an Associated Press photographer, who was shot by a rogue policeman when she was covering the Afghan presidential election in 2014. The NPR team also included Monika Evstatieva, the director of the “All Things Considered” program, and Tom Bowman, NPR’s Pentagon correspondent.",0
20015,20015,Former Knick Charles Oakley Is Arrested After Altercation at Madison Square Garden - The New York Times,Mike Vorkunov,"When Jeff Hornacek took the job as the Knicks coach last May, he did so with eyes wide open. He was not oblivious to the dysfunction that has been a part of the organization for years. He expected some controversy or another with the Knicks. Roughly nine months into his tenure, the team has not fallen short of Hornacek’s expectations. “It’s lived up to the billing,” he said Wednesday before the Knicks fell,   to the Los Angeles Clippers. “It’s been something out here. ” But even Hornacek could not have expected that the game that night would dissolve into a   circus. While a feud continues to stew between the Knicks president Phil Jackson and the team’s top star, Carmelo Anthony, amid   struggles, their game ceded the spotlight Wednesday night to a courtside fracas. Charles Oakley, the voluble but beloved former Knicks stalwart, was arrested after getting into an altercation with security guards midway through the first quarter. Oakley was removed from Madison Square Garden and handcuffed. Oakley was sitting courtside, in an aisle seat in the first row of the section near the Knicks’ bench. Accounts of his behavior varied widely. According to some spectators seated nearby, he had been calm early in the game. He took a photograph with Felice Bergman, a fan with season tickets several rows higher. James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, with whom Oakley has a contentious relationship, sat nearby, but several spectators said they did not see Oakley exchange any words with Dolan or try to provoke him. But they did see Oakley exchanging glances with a security guard who was standing several feet away. Oakley seemed to utter something to the guard when he walked by, according to T. J. Veenstra, who was sitting behind Oakley. A guard soon came over to Oakley and asked him to leave. Oakley asked why. “He just couldn’t understand why,” said Matthew Barbara, who sat a few rows up from Oakley. “We didn’t see him throw a punch or do anything. He wasn’t nasty to any of the people behind him. We’re trying to figure out what happened. ” Oakley was soon surrounded by a phalanx of guards, as John McEnroe, the former tennis champion, stood behind them on the court watching. As they tried to remove Oakley, he pushed one guard twice before being restrained and taken away. The game, which was still in its early stages, stopped as players from both teams watched the commotion. As he was being led out, the crowd chanted: “Oakley! Oakley!” Knicks guard Derrick Rose later said: “That was the weirdest. I didn’t know what was going on. ” The police said Oakley had been charged with three counts of   assault and one count of criminal trespass, all misdemeanors. He was released with an appearance ticket. The Knicks, in a statement, said Oakley had behaved in a “highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner. ” But fans sitting nearby said they did not feel that was the case. “Nothing he did rose to the level of what happened,” Jamie Vitiello said. “They overacted. ” The episode was a distraction from another Knicks quarrel. The previous day, Jackson had posted a message on Twitter that seemed to endorse a Bleacher Report story painting Anthony as a star who did not have a sufficient will to win and who was more interested in building his brand and his own statistics. It was another shot in a feud between Jackson and Anthony that has persisted all season. After the game, Anthony was asked if he still trusted Jackson. “I did say that,” Anthony said, adding: “I trust the process. ” Anthony and Jackson have met twice to calm the waters. In December, Jackson said Anthony was a   on offense. In January, Charley Rosen, a longtime confidante of Jackson’s, wrote a column on FanRag Sports that said Anthony had “outlived his usefulness in New York. ” And for the last several weeks, Anthony has heard his name in trade rumors as the Knicks have reportedly tried to trade him, to teams including the Clippers. Anthony, however, has a   clause in his contract and has not indicated that he wants to leave the organization. Jackson, however, did try to play peacekeeper in the Knicks’ other contentious situation on Wednesday. After Oakley was taken away from his seat, Jackson rushed out to the tunnel to try to calm him. But Oakley continued to fume as he stood outside the court with his hands in cuffs and guards surrounding him. “I didn’t do nothing,” he said, mixing in expletives. He said Dolan was responsible  —   although he did not say for what. Oakley has had a conflicted relationship with the Knicks. He was a fan favorite during his 10 seasons with the team. He was known for his rugged and physical style and helped take them to the 1994 N. B. A. Finals. Yet, he has been exiled over the last few years after a falling out with the organization. While many of his former teammates returned to Madison Square Garden, Oakley had not. “The boss don’t like me,” Oakley told The New York Times last fall. He said he has tried to meet with Dolan but has been rebuffed. “I mean, I had at least 15 people try to set up a meeting,” Oakley said. “He won’t meet. I want to sit down to talk to him. I want me and him in a room. And lock the door. Lock that door!” On Wednesday, however, they shared an arena  —   one that had once been the setting for Oakley’s glory days. When he was eclipsed by security guards, Doc Rivers, the Clippers coach and a former teammate, immediately recognized him at the center. “That was tough to watch,” Rivers said.",0
20016,20016,Is Britney Spears Ready to Stand on Her Own? - The New York Times,Serge F. Kovaleski and Joe Coscarelli,"LAS VEGAS  —   The disturbing images seem so distant now: the     tabloid tale  —   head shorn, face twisted, umbrella gripped like a police baton as she bashed a paparazzi S. U. V. window. More than eight years after her meltdown, Britney Spears, at 34, appears to be thriving. In September, she announced a   $35 million deal to extend her residency at Planet Hollywood Resort  Casino here. Forbes named her the    female musician of 2015, ahead of powerhouses like Rihanna and Nicki Minaj. And she’s been hard at work on her ninth studio album, expected this year. With her television guest spots and a wildly popular, often eccentric Instagram feed featuring her toned abs and adorable sons, Ms. Spears looks like that rare celebrity who has vanquished deep travails to snatch a second chance. “I’m in a real good place in my life,” Ms. Spears told People magazine last year, in an interview about her personal life. “I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. ” Ms. Spears’s team presents her onstage as fully in control, and backstage, as the mastermind of her show, an artist in top form. But that view seems at odds with the conclusions routinely drawn about her at probate court in Los Angeles, where an undisclosed mental illness and substance abuse led her family to take action in 2008. Since then, Ms. Spears’s life has been controlled by a   conservatorship, known in other states as a guardianship, designed for people who cannot take care of themselves. According to the arrangement, which is typically used to protect the old, the mentally disabled or the extremely ill, Ms. Spears cannot make key decisions, personal or financial, without the approval of her conservators: her father, Jamie Spears, and a lawyer, Andrew M. Wallet. Her most mundane purchases, from a drink at Starbucks to a song on iTunes, are tracked in court documents as part of the plan to safeguard the great fortune she has earned but does not ultimately control. While the conservators are widely credited with rescuing Ms. Spears’s career  —   and her life  —   her apparent stability and success could belie the need for continuing restrictions. There are recent signs, in fact, that the conservators are now acknowledging the great progress she has made. After successfully fighting to keep her from testifying in at least three prior lawsuits  —   (a probate judge had previously agreed that doing so could cause her “irreparable harm”)  —   Ms. Spears’s conservators allowed her to testify on Monday in a case filed against her by a former   manager. They agreed that “giving such testimony is not likely to cause harm to her,” according to court papers. Could this be the start of a major unfastening of the strictures she lives under? Neither the conservators nor her managers or lawyers will discuss her status, and Ms. Spears did not respond to multiple requests seeking an interview. While it is not possible to get an accurate sense of someone’s mental state from afar, Ms. Spears’s friends and former associates said in interviews that, for her, the conservatorship has become an accepted fact of life  —   not a cage but a protective bubble that allows her to worry about her true passions: music and her children. “If anyone knew the real Britney, they would know that she would rather be remembered for being the great mother she is rather than the artist she is,” said David Lucado, a former boyfriend whose relationship with Ms. Spears foundered in 2014 amid charges of infidelity that Mr. Lucado denies. “And if anyone could see her interactions with her kids, they would know that there is no need for a conservatorship over Britney’s personal life. ” Since the conservatorship began, some restrictions have been eased. More   rollbacks were discussed several years ago but never occurred, according to a person who has been involved in Ms. Spears’s care who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ultimately some of the people who would help to decide whether to end it are the conservators and doctors who now help oversee it, many of whom receive fees from Ms. Spears’s estate for their work on her behalf. Ms. Spears’s status and progress are measured by a court investigator for her case, who is assigned to file reports on her progress once every other year. (Those under conservatorship are not required to regularly appear in front of a judge after their conservators are appointed.) And should Ms. Spears ask to be released, her cause would probably be led by the man the court appointed to be her chief advocate, a lawyer, Samuel D. Ingham III. Mr. Ingham’s role is, among other things, to ensure that the conservators do not loot her assets, abuse their power or inappropriately restrict her freedom. There has been some debate in California over whether   lawyers do enough to advocate the rights of those under conservatorship. Just last year, the state’s Senate Committee on Judiciary noted in a report: “In theory the   counsel should be arguing on the proposed conservatee’s behalf for a   alternative to conservatorship whenever possible. ” Mr. Ingham has been awarded more than $2 million in fees for his work on Ms. Spears’s behalf since 2008. This is in addition to the $6. 9 million paid from the estate to the conservators and other lawyers who have helped manage Ms. Spears’s affairs under the current arrangement. Ms. Spears has never publicly questioned any of these payments, but critics of the process have. “As long as she is bringing in so much money and as long as the lawyers and conservators are getting paid, there is little incentive to end it,” said Elaine Renoire, president of the National Association to Stop Guardian Abuse, an advocacy group. “Usually, the conservatorship just keeps going unless the conservatee makes a fuss or the family does. ” No one questioned whether Ms. Spears needed help in early 2008 on Jan. 30, her psychiatrist had called for assistance, and when the ambulance left the singer’s Los Angeles home, it was led by a robust entourage of police vehicles. For days, Ms. Spears had been behaving bizarrely, speaking in a British accent and driving at breakneck speeds. Now she was strapped to a gurney en route to U. C. L. A. Medical Center. Helicopters buzzed overhead. It was the second time in less than a month that Ms. Spears had been taken to a hospital by ambulance for an emergency psychiatric evaluation. Anyone watching that day would not have recognized Ms. Spears as the musical phenomenon who, a decade earlier,   and 17, had posed in hot pants and bra on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine. With hits including “  …    Baby One More Time” she dominated the charts, and her first four albums sold a combined 30 million copies. But like child stars before her, Ms. Spears encountered the pressures created by sudden fame and wealth. And a rocky personal life did not help. In 2002, her relationship with Justin Timberlake ended. In January 2004, she married a childhood friend from Louisiana in Las Vegas  —   a union that lasted 55 hours. Nine months later, she married again, this time to Kevin Federline, a local backup dancer. Two years later, in November 2006, after the birth of their second son, she filed for divorce. Drug and alcohol issues fueled her decline. In 2007, Ms. Spears twice entered treatment but each time cut her stay short. The substance abuse would factor in her battle to retain custody of her children. The idea of losing contact with them tormented her, associates said. After being told she had lost custody of them in October 2007, she spent a night sleeping in a parking lot, according to court papers. (She has since worked out a custody arrangement with Mr. Federline.) “It clearly wasn’t working with her in control of the ship,” said Peter Katsis, who was part of her management team in 2007. “It was overwhelming for her when she came of age. ” Just what kind of mental condition afflicts Ms. Spears has never been publicly disclosed. But, whatever the ailment, by 2008 it seemed to have full possession of her. Although divorced, Ms. Spears’s worried parents decided their daughter was in crisis. Her father, a former welder, oil worker, cook and a recovering alcoholic, had subjected his family to years of “verbal abuse, abandonment” and “erratic behavior” as a result of his heavy drinking, Britney’s mother, Lynne Spears, wrote in her 2008 book, “Through the Storm: A Real Story of Fame and Family in a Tabloid World. ” But her parents rebuilt some kind of relationship after Mr. Spears stopped drinking, and they sought to intervene. After days of fasting and praying, Mrs. Spears said, Mr. Spears asked the court to establish a temporary conservatorship for his daughter that would give him broad control over her treatment, visitors, security and daily life. On Feb. 1, 2008, while Ms. Spears was still in the hospital, a judge, Reva G. Goetz, granted his wish. “I shuddered to think,” Mrs. Spears wrote in her book, describing her worries about those influencing Britney at the time, “what depths of desperation we would have to plumb to regain charge of our child. ” At the outset, Ms. Spears thought of challenging the arrangement, according to Adam Streisand, one of two lawyers whom she spoke to at the time. Mr. Streisand said Ms. Spears told him she was not comfortable with her father as conservator of her finances. “It was clear to me that she seemed a bit agitated,” Mr. Streisand said. “But my sense was that she did have the capacity to pick a lawyer and that she could make a rational decision. ” The judge, though, citing a recent medical evaluation, said the singer was not capable of hiring her own counsel. Mr. Streisand said he respected the doctor’s opinion and went away. “Britney wanted to oppose the conservatorship,” he said, “but she was also extremely worried about her kids and seemed to understand that the best thing to do to see her kids was to accept it. ” By the end of 2008, the conservatorship had been made permanent. By March 2009, Ms. Spears was back on tour. Initially, though, she seemed frustrated by the restrictions. “I think it’s too in control,” she said during a 2008 interview with MTV. “If I wasn’t under the restraints I’m under, I’d feel so liberated. ” She continued, “There’s no excitement, there’s no passion. ” And then: “Even when you go to jail, you know there’s the time when you’re going to get out. But in this situation, it’s  . ” Since then, Ms. Spears has said little publicly about this arrangement. The conservatorship system in California, troubled for decades, has undergone reforms in recent years that were designed to further protect the old and infirm people who are its typical clients. Ms. Spears hardly fits that bill, but this system operates for her the same way as it does for others. Probate judges in California can appoint two kinds of conservators: ones responsible for a person’s physical and mental health, and others who are put in charge of the individual’s finances. Ms. Spears has both. Her father, 63, is responsible for her physical    —   making sure she takes her medicine, for example  —   and manages her estate. He shares the financial oversight with Mr. Wallet, who specializes in conservatorships and probate law. Mr. Spears takes in about $130, 000 a year as a conservator and is also reimbursed for the rent on an office he uses. His bills are reviewed and approved by the judge. He has sought only modest increases over the years, though he also requested 1. 5 percent of gross revenues from the performances and merchandising tied to Ms. Spears’s Las Vegas show. The court, Ms. Spears and her   lawyer signed off on it. For a time, during 2012, Jason Trawick, then her boyfriend, also served as   for her personal  . As conservator, according to his court filings, Mr. Spears’s work has included “overseeing and coordinating Britney’s [redacted] business, costuming, personal, household stuff, and legal matters (touching upon entertainment, music, other business opportunities, family law issues, the litigation, trial   resolution of other disputes, and ongoing litigation and conservatorship matters). ” He negotiates business opportunities, such as her 2012 stint as a judge on “The X Factor,” as well as interviews and sponsorships, even the maintenance of vehicles and the custody arrangement for her children. Mr. Spears and his lawyers have also aggressively kept at bay anyone they consider a threat to Ms. Spears’s stability, including a former business manager, a former boyfriend and a lawyer who once sought to intervene in her case, all of whom were served with restraining orders. In 2009, after a Spears fan site, BreatheHeavy. com, started a “Free Britney” campaign critical of the conservatorship, its owner, Jordan Miller, said he received an irate call from Mr. Spears, who threatened to have the website taken down. Speaking today, Mr. Miller says he can understand the lengths her family took. “It was a really volatile situation, and they were trying to protect her,” he said. The conservators’ work is monitored by Mr. Ingham, Ms. Spears’s veteran   lawyer. Though the court’s typical maximum hourly fee is $250, Judge Goetz awarded Mr. Ingham as much as $475 an hour to represent Ms. Spears, citing an exception in court rules that allows higher fees “in cases involving unusual problems requiring extraordinary expertise. ” Mr. Ingham, who describes himself as a lawyer with expertise in   conservatorship cases, told the court his typical hourly fee is $595. For a time in 2014, Mr. Ingham’s clients included both Ms. Spears and Casey Kasem, the radio personality, then 82, who was also in a conservatorship until his death that year his wife was challenging the size of the lawyer’s legal bills. Mr. Ingham said the case was particularly complicated, but Mrs. Kasem’s lawyer at one point accused Mr. Ingham of padding his bills, a charge the judge dismissed. Mr. Ingham declined to comment. Ms. Spears is not known to have ever questioned any of Mr. Ingham’s fees. The rules for  meeting Britney are tight. No selfies. No autographs. No invading her personal space. Each night before Ms. Spears appears in her “Piece of Me” show at Planet Hollywood’s Axis Theater here, she poses for photos with fans backstage, maintaining her brand at a time when her public appearances and interviews are rare and tightly controlled. (Interviewers who are approved seldom mention the conservatorship.) The    packages start at $1, 500 and include a backstage tour led by a longtime Spears employee. “Britney is very shy,” Felicia Culotta, the V. I. P. coordinator, said on one night last year. “I know y’all find that very hard to believe  —   she goes out on that stage, and she is a powerhouse. But she is extremely shy. ” “Britney plays off energy,” Ms. Culotta added. “If you go in scared of her, she is going to be scared of you. So don’t be scared of her. She’s very normal. ” The routine and consistency of her Las Vegas residency  —   typically three shows a week for six weeks followed by six weeks off  —   are a good fit for a mother of two looking to avoid the grind of a tour. During her 90 minutes onstage, Ms. Spears recycles two dozen hits into an act that features backup dancers, pyrotechnics and showers of confetti. She changes costumes repeatedly. At one point, she jumps in a harness from a    tree. During each performance, a man or woman picked from the audience is strapped into a leather bondage harness and forced to creep across the stage on all fours. On this night, Ms. Spears, in a bustier, held the leash on a man. “Your ass is out of this world!” she screamed. To be sure, the show does not showcase the Britney of old: Once a fluid, natural dancer, Ms. Spears can appear stiff, even robotic, today, relying on flailing arms and flashy sets. Her vocals are largely prerecorded, and the   can lapse. She seems to be doing a job, but a good job, and there is no arguing that the show is doing well: It often fills the Axis, the largest theater on the Strip. Ms. Spears splits her time between Las Vegas and Los Angeles, where her sons are in school, often taking the   flight back after a weekday performance. She and her children are spotted around town in Las Vegas  —   by the Planet Hollywood pool or at the Sonic   near the Strip. (The fast food outlet was the hub of Kentwood, La. the small town where Ms. Spears grew up.) In addition to the residency, Ms. Spears’s next album, her first since 2013, is expected this summer. For months, she has teased her new music  —   a single, “Make Me (Oooh),” is due in May  —   and logged studio time with hot songwriters. Online, she has promoted herself in photos as a sexy pop star back in fighting shape. “Honestly, I’m just particular with this record,” she told V, the magazine. “It’s my baby, and so I really want it done right. ” Music is only one part of the business of being Britney Spears these days. More than a dozen interconnected businesses, including profitable lines of lingerie and perfume, are overseen by the conservators. Occasionally the businesses and Ms. Spears are sued. When a company, Brand Sense Partners, sued Ms. Spears in 2011, in a dispute over a licensing agreement for one of her fragrances, its lawyer at the time, Geoffrey A. Neri, argued that the singer had to be capable of testifying. He pointed out in court papers that she takes care of her children, makes numerous public appearances and was then on a   tour across much of the world. “The notion that Britney Spears is mentally or emotionally unfit to testify under oath is a sham,” Mr. Neri wrote. But in that case and two others, Judge Goetz ruled the singer too fragile, mentally, to testify. The judge, now retired, declined an interview request the case has since been transferred to a new judge. On Monday, after years of maintaining that the singer was too vulnerable to be questioned, her conservators consented to a deposition by Ms. Spears in a lawsuit filed against her and her father by Sam Lutfi, an associate from the time of her breakdown. (He claims Ms. Spears owes him money, asserting she made an oral agreement in 2007 to have him serve as her manager and that her father assaulted him.) Despite an attempt by the conservators to separate Ms. Spears and Mr. Lutfi during her testimony  —   his “physical presence in the same conference room as Ms. Spears poses serious risks” to her   they argued in court filings  —   both parties were present for her deposition, which lasted about four hours. Ms. Spears, in a magenta blazer and pearls, testified without incident in Mr. Lutfi’s presence, even snacking on a cookie during a down moment. Soon after, she was back to posting on Instagram, including an image that read, “All energy is contagious. ” Hundreds of supportive comments flooded in from fans seemingly well aware of the latest legal twist in her life. “You have gone through hell and back again but you have persevered every time,” one wrote. “You got this. ”",0
20017,20017,Palestinian Terror Groups Celebrate ’Sweet’ Jerusalem Truck-Ramming Attack,Ali Waked,"The news of Sunday’s   attack in Jerusalem that left four Israelis dead and 17 injured has sparked outbursts of jubilation among Palestinian terrorist groups. [Hamas welcomed the attack, saying the carnage is a “natural reaction” to the “crimes of the occupation,” and what the terrorist group claimed was the infringement on the “Palestinians’ rights” and their holy sites.  Fawzi Barhoum, the movement’s spokesperson, lauded the attack as a “courageous act in defense of the holy sites and especially Al Aqsa mosque. ” He added that the attack proves that the “Jerusalem intifada [a series of  attacks on Israelis that started in October 2015] continues to defend our lands and holy sites, and the Israeli oppression and aggression won’t be able to stop it. The oppression will only increase the determination of the Palestinian people to continue its heroic resistance in all its forms. ” The   Islamic Jihad also welcomed the attack, and said in a statement that the deadly   represented “a natural reaction to the crimes of the Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people. ” The   journalist Adham Abu Slamiyeh tweeted a picture of Palestinians handing out sweets, with the following caption: “The sweets of the attack are in.

20018,20018,How to Plan Your Family’s Vacation - The New York Times,Shivani Vora,"Family vacations should be about creating a lifetime of memories, spending time with your loved ones and, most important, having fun. More often than not, however, they end up being just the opposite, according to Kay Merrill, a family travel specialist and the owner of Are We There Yet? Family Adventures, a travel consultancy in Larkspur, Calif. Here, she shares her tips for making sure that your family getaway is as picture perfect as you imagine it to be. Involve Everyone in Planning, Even Younger Children Your    may not be able to have much to say in planning the itinerary, but Ms. Merrill said that children who are 5 or older should definitely help out. “Most any place you go will have activities and sights that will appeal to both you and them,” she said, “and once you’ve decided where you’re going, it’s important to spend the time to figure out what you will actually do there. ” During the initial planning, she suggested getting a map and some books relevant to your destination and leaving them out in your home where they are easily visible such as in the kitchen. “Encourage your children to look at them and have them come up with some things that they want to do on the trip,” she said. She added that parents should incorporate their own interests to make sure the trip is fun for them too. Set the Mood in Advance If Cuba is on the agenda, for example, cook a Cuban meal or play mambo music, which is integral to the country’s culture. Travel movies and YouTube videos can also build interest before you go. Build in Downtime Daily In an attempt to see and do everything your destination offers, you may be tempted to plan an itinerary that has your family going all day long, but Ms. Merrill warns against overscheduling. “If you try to pack in too much, everyone in the family, especially kids, will get cranky and whiny,” she said. Balance out a morning of sightseeing or other activities with a few hours to chill in the afternoon. Ms. Merrill said that   is a great time to relax  —   you and your brood can unwind by the hotel pool or read a book. Children can also write in a journal about their favorite part of the morning. Then you can all head out again for another activity. Take a Diversion From the   For the family vacations she plans, Ms. Merrill said that she likes to include an activity that is different from the trip’s theme. If it’s a beach getaway to Nevis in the Caribbean, she would include a visit to the island’s farms to meet farmers and sample their produce. “Often, this diversion ends up being the most memorable part of the trip,” she said. Book Creative Tours and Excursions “Sticking to the standard tours,” she said, is “boring so I encourage families to get creative and have a better trip by finding the excursions that most visitors don’t do. ” That could mean a walking tour of secret gardens in Paris or a visit to a local family’s home in Marrakesh, Morocco. Your hotel concierge, local tour companies or a travel adviser can help find these     activities.",0
20019,20019,"Speaker David Gowan Reshapes Arizona House, From the Carpets on Up - The New York Times",Fernanda Santos,"PHOENIX  —   When lawmakers in the Arizona House of Representatives went looking for a new speaker in late 2014, they turned to David M. Gowan, an unassuming Republican legislator whom colleagues on both sides of the aisle saw as someone they could work with. But Mr. Gowan has proved to be anything but. He has angered lawmakers from the right and left since assuming the post in January 2015, putting his own stamp on a legislative body that has garnered its share of attention for its   leanings on issues like immigration and abortion. Right after approving a budget last year that forced state agencies to make another round of cuts, Mr. Gowan, a conservative who makes his home in a rural border county in southeastern Arizona, embarked on a redecorating spree. The House floor got an elegant carpet. Lawmakers got reupholstered chairs. His leadership team got cherry wood office furniture. He also planned for showers and a multiuse room in the basement, but shelved the project after half of his Republican caucus chided his “excessive spending” in a letter. In January, Mr. Gowan repaid the state for travel reimbursements and daily allowances he had improperly claimed, a matter that remains under investigation by the state’s attorney general. He began this month by abruptly revoking reporters’ access to the House floor unless they agreed to an extensive background check. None of them did. Fourteen journalists regularly assigned to cover the Capitol retreated to the   gallery that morning, taking pictures and writing stories as a group of visiting elementary school students giggled and gawked. State Representative Ken Clark, a Democrat from Phoenix, warned, “This is a slippery slope. ” In an   column, Amanda Ventura, the president of the local chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, wrote, “Reporters pose no security threat  —   unless truth hurts. ” From the floor, Mr. Gowan told his colleagues, by way of explanation, “I want to make sure you’re protected. ” But the ensuing debate promptly stirred another controversy, about guns in the chamber. Mr. Gowan had authorized the removal of a sign that banned firearms from the staff entrance to the House building, effectively allowing lawmakers to enter armed. Mr. Gowan, 46, who was first elected as a state representative in 2008, is leaving the House at the end of the year because of term limits. He is now aiming his sights at Washington, running to represent one of the largest congressional districts in the country. In a crowded field of Republican contenders, he is considered an underdog, though he does not seem deterred. “David Gowan has always been underestimated, always traveled under the radar,” Frank Antenori, a former Republican state senator who is a close friend of Mr. Gowan’s, said in an interview. “He’s got a real folksy personality, people just don’t see him as being as aggressive. That’s a big mistake. ” Mr. Gowan hails from conservative Cochise County, a land of cattle ranchers that takes in Fort Huachuca  —   once home to the storied Buffalo Soldiers, these days a sprawling base that is host to the armed forces’ intelligence training program. He earned a living as a magazine distributor  —   stacking periodicals and paperback novels on the shelves of supermarkets and drugstores  —   and teaching martial arts on the side he is a black belt in karate. Mr. Gowan turned his political ambitions into action methodically and patiently. He ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination to the Arizona House twice, in 2004 and 2006, focusing his campaign on a single issue: illegal immigration, a major point of contention in the border district he wanted to represent.  An editorial in The Tucson Citizen, a newspaper that has since ceased publication, called his command of other topics “fuzzy at best. ” Jonathan Paton, who defeated him twice in primaries, said determination is what got Mr. Gowan where he is. “He does not quit,” said Mr. Paton, a Republican who served in both the Arizona House and Senate. “He does not accept that he shouldn’t be in office, that he shouldn’t be speaker of the House, that he shouldn’t be in Congress. ” Mr. Gowan is one of seven Republicans running for Arizona’s First Congressional District, whose jagged borders encompass nine counties in full or in part in eastern, northern and central Arizona. The area has traditionally leaned Republican, but the district itself has been competitive since it was realigned in 2010. In 2014, Ann Kirkpatrick, a Democrat, narrowly defeated her Republican opponent, Andy Tobin, a former Arizona House speaker. She is leaving her congressional seat to run against John McCain, the   Republican senator and former presidential candidate. One of Mr. Gowan’s rivals for the Republican nomination is Sheriff Paul Babeu of Pinal County, one of the most vociferous proponents of more border security. His county, an expanse of desert and rugged mountains near the   border, is a major route for drug cartels bringing contraband to Phoenix and Tucson. “In a crowded Republican field like this, each of the candidates is trying to move to the right of the other,” said Matthew Benson, a political consultant and senior aide to former Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican. “Nobody is running as a moderate. ” “They’re all trying to prove they’re the most conservative and go to Washington to shake things up,” he added. Mr. Antenori said Mr. Gowan got into politics “to make sure that our basic liberties were protected,” in particular “our religious freedoms, the Second Amendment, our property rights. ” At the Capitol, Mr. Gowan is reserved, a man who has a tendency to mumble his words. While his predecessor, Mr. Tobin, was known for his “backslapping, more public, more accessible” ways, Mr. Gowan has “a quiet, more   style, but he has been just as effective,” said Glenn Hamer, the president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, an influential   group. Mr. Gowan rarely gives interviews and declined to comment for this article. Lobbyists often meet with him over lunch. In 2013, Mr. Gowan ranked No. 3 on a list of    expenditures reported by lobbyists, according to an analysis of such records by The Arizona Capitol Times. (“I’m looking for free food,” he told the newspaper.) For his part, Representative Bruce Wheeler, a leader of the Democratic minority, was unreservedly blunt in his criticism: “The leadership under Gowan has been disastrous,” he said. But to Republicans and Democrats alike, the storm over the banning of reporters from the House floor became a source of embarrassment. Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, told reporters he felt “pretty safe around you. ” On April 8, the day Mr. Gowan issued his ban, The Capitol Times suggested in an online article that the move may have been motivated by the fact that one of its reporters, Hank Stephenson, has written about the improper reimbursements and the lobbyists’ expenses. Mr. Gowan rescinded his ban on Tuesday, maintaining nonetheless that his motivation had been to protect the chamber.",0
20020,20020,Why Christopher Kimball Is Moving On From America’s Test Kitchen - The New York Times,Kim Severson,"BOSTON  —   Christopher Kimball spent much of the last year as the dark prince of the recipe world, a brooding exile who had left his   America’s Test Kitchen empire in a painful split he hadn’t seen coming. Now he is moving on. Instead of polishing his carefully created New England sensibility and hovering over the obsessive   platform on which he built Cook’s Illustrated magazine and its offspring, Mr. Kimball is loosening his bow tie and shifting his culinary worldview. His new project is called Milk Street Kitchen. With $6 million from investors and more at the ready, Mr. Kimball is remodeling the ground floor of the Flour  Grain Exchange building on Milk Street in the financial district here in Boston. In the fall, he plans to publish a new magazine, shoot a public television series and begin writing books. He’ll start a cooking school, and promote the whole enterprise at a dozen live road shows. He is even designing a chef’s knife to sell. The big idea is to bring techniques from the world’s kitchens to America’s Wednesday night dinner table. It’s a bold pivot for a man whose magazines rarely showcased ethnic recipes. “It’s not looking around the world and doing a tagine or a couscous dish,” he said of the concept. “It’s looking around the world and seeing how people are thinking about food. ” Instead of using Eurocentric techniques that rely on concentrating flavors through long applications of heat, Mr. Kimball is exploring ways to build dishes that rely on texture, spice and freshness. Instead of making chicken stock like a frugal French cook who simmers bones and scraps for hours, why not boil a whole chicken for just an hour like a Chinese cook, using ginger, scallions and herbs to elicit a more delicate flavor? Mr. Kimball, who lives in Boston and Vermont, has been cooking this way at home for the last few years. He has become a student of spice and of authors like Yotam Ottolenghi. He has taken inspiration from his travels, too. Sliced oranges coated in cold caramel sauce flavored with star anise  —   a dessert inspired by a trip to Rome with his four children  —   is much more interesting to him these days than apple pie. “I don’t think I have anything left to add about how to make an oatmeal cookie,” he said. If it works, Mr. Kimball will cement his reputation as an intellectual and business powerhouse of American recipes. But if it fails? “What’s the worst that can happen?” he asked over dinner in Cambridge one evening. “Public humiliation?” The move is certainly a gamble. Mr. Kimball, who is worth tens of millions of dollars, turns 65 this month. Although he can be tender in person, his public demeanor is stern and sometimes awkward. He is the guy in the room who always knows more than you, a fan of rabbit hunting and classic literature who is more closely associated with roast turkey and root vegetables than with Mexican street food and Israeli hummus. Even he worries how that persona will translate into a new brand focused on global flavors. He doesn’t want to come off as a latecomer in a nation that has already moved past its   perspective. It doesn’t help that cooks like Rick Bayless, the white chef who has become an authority on Mexican cooking, are being swept up in a battle over cultural appropriation. “We’re not translating the ethnic soul of a community,” Mr. Kimball said. “We’re just saying this is a good idea. You need someone who knows a fair amount about cooking to do this, who has the thoughtfulness and testing to translate Thai cooking to our kitchens. ” Corby Kummer, the   food writer, has never been a big fan. “He has a tendency to flatten things out, and that can be dull,” Mr. Kummer said. But, he added, Mr. Kimball has great value as someone who offers authority and reassurance. “If he can do that with newer flavors and make the cooks who look to him for that reassurance understand a new way to cook, more power to him,” he said. Mr. Kimball is building his venture with a small crew who followed him out of America’s Test Kitchen, chief among them Melissa Baldino, a former executive producer who was once his assistant. She married Mr. Kimball a year after he divorced his second wife in 2012. It’s a loyal team, and   veterans are betting that Milk Street Kitchen will succeed. “It’s a huge mistake to write off Chris Kimball,” said Rux Martin, the cookbook editor who has her own imprint at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. “He’s always been really good at following where the money is coming from, based on what people want. ” Mr. Kimball’s first venture publishing reliable recipes with a wonky specificity came in 1980, when he used $100, 000 from investors to start Cook’s Magazine. He went on to sell it for a big profit to Condé Nast Publications, which later shut it down. He bought back the title for $175 and reintroduced it as Cook’s Illustrated in 1993. It was a    antithesis of Gourmet magazine and took no ads. It still doesn’t. If you wanted to know how to make perfect Bolognese in a slow cooker or a foolproof pie crust (pro tip: use vodka) here it was. His approach ushered in an era of intellectual cookbook authors who preferred analysis to romance. Among the magazine’s alumni are Mark Bittman, a former New York Times columnist, and J. Kenji   the author of “The Food Lab,” who developed the vodka pie crust during his time at Cook’s Illustrated. America’s Test Kitchen, which includes the magazine Cook’s Country as well as radio and television programs, is built on a culture of testing so rigorous that it can border on fetish. And when other food websites were offering free content, Mr. Kimball insisted on paid subscriptions. “It all comes from Chris’s idea that you can’t give anything away,” said John Willoughby, the first executive editor of Cook’s Illustrated and now its executive editor for magazines. The schism, by all accounts, was painful. Mr. Kimball said he saw it coming during a board meeting last July. The company had grown to 180 people, and the board of Boston Common Press, which owns America’s Test Kitchen, thought a new management style was in order. Although America’s Test Kitchen was doing very well financially, the initial investors wanted more profit. They added new board members who were aligned with that goal. David Nussbaum, a former media and   executive, was hired as the company’s chief executive, outranking Mr. Kimball. “Quite frankly, the owners realized Chris is about 65, and they had to think of a   succession plan,” Mr. Nussbaum said in an interview. “These owners were very clear they wanted someone to come and run the business for their heirs. ” They asked Mr. Kimball to continue hosting the television and radio shows, and suggested that he write a memoir, Mr. Kimball said. As an owner, he would reap the financial rewards of the company’s expansion. Mr. Kimball balked. “You end up as the guy in the white suit standing in front of the bucket of chicken,” he said. Things got worse fast. One day last August, Mr. Kimball walked into Mr. Willoughby’s office. “I got fired,” he said. “I didn’t think you could,” Mr. Willoughby said. “I didn’t think I could, either,” Mr. Kimball replied. The new leadership put some of its   product reviews outside the subscription pay wall. Editors began creating a free digital magazine and a traveling road show based on the success of the 2012 book “The Science of Good Cooking. ” The hunt is on to find a bigger space and hire more digitally savvy employees. Mr. Nussbaum said America’s Test Kitchen, with its 50 recipe testers, would stay close to what he called a Consumer Reports point of view, but “having said that, the world in which we eat has continued to change, and America’s Test Kitchen wants to participate in that change. ” He and Mr. Kimball continue to speak well of each other, at least to a reporter. They had lunch recently. Mr. Kimball may do work for America’s Test Kitchen, which still provides much of his income. He seems happy to be starting something new. “I like to get up in the morning and go to work,” he said. “And I think there is still a substantial audience for that work. ”",0
20021,20021,Tech Worker Craig Diangelo Forced to Train H-1B Replacement Now Running for Congress,Dan Riehl,"Craig Diangelo, Republican congressional candidate in Connecticut’s 5th District and former information technology worker, who was laid off and forced to train his foreign replacement here via an   visa, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow Thursday. [Fox Business News also recently reported Diangelo’s story:   “In the very beginning we did not know that we would be training our replacements  …     the CIO came down from Boston, said that she would hold a town hall meeting to discuss the future of our IT at our particular company,” Diangelo said. “We all got into the room, 220 of us, she proceeded to tell us that  …     what we are going to do is  …     outsource IT infrastructure and IT development. ” Diangelo said company employees at the time were told it was because “global employees can adjust to change a lot faster than the American worker. ” He questioned why American workers weren’t classified equally. Diangelo said while he feels supported by many average citizens in Connecticut, that’s not the case with the state’s politicians. “Senator Blumenthal, after I spoke with him and talked about this, he went out and    .   …     That was to increase the number of   by 100, 000, on top of the 85, 000 visas that are issued every year,” he said. “Elizabeth Esty, who I’m running against, she was very curt with me,” he added, saying she passed him off to an aide who was supposed to call him but never did. Diangelo said Esty was not even informed of the pertinent immigration laws at the time of their encounter. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

20022,20022,"Noah Wall: After Years of GOP Repeal Bills Under Obama, Now ’They Back Down’",Dan Riehl,"Noah Wall, the national director of campaigns for FreedomWorks, joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday to discuss the FreedomWorks Day of Action rally scheduled for Wednesday in opposition to the Republican Obamacare replacement plan. [Concerning a full repeal of Obamacare, Wall said, “We’ve been promised this in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016, and these were not lighthearted promises. These were very powerful promises from members of Congress and the U. S. Senate across the political spectrum of Republicans. ”  “Lo and behold,” added Wall, “the voters give Republicans Congress, they give them the Senate, and they give them the White House, and all of a sudden, the establishment comes up with a whole lot of reasons why we can’t do what we’ve been promising the American people. ” Expressing disappointment at years of promises from Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare only to now produce a bill that falls short of that, Wall said, “I’m deeply disappointed. Republicans in 2015 voted to pretty much fully repeal Obamacare. And I don’t understand why they couldn’t. ” Citing years of Obamacare GOP repeal votes, Wall continued, “They voted for this [repeal] when they knew it had no chance of actually getting signed into law. All of a sudden, we get a chance to get this signed into law, and they back down. ” Concluded Wall, “It’s, unfortunately, very typical of Republican leadership, but we need to hold them to a higher standard. ” More information on the FreedomWorks Day of Action is available here.

20024,20024,Live Nation Postpones Six New York Concerts in Wake of Shooting - The New York Times,Ben Sisario,"As the police continue to investigate a shooting during a   concert at a Manhattan nightclub last week that left one person dead and three injured, the concert promoter behind the club is postponing a series of shows, including many rap events. Live Nation, the giant concert company that operates the club, Irving Plaza, said it was postponing three rap concerts there over the next week, as well as three other concerts at another of its New York clubs. The shows include events by the rappers Joey Badass, Mac Miller and Vince Staples at Irving Plaza that were being presented with the Governors Ball Music Festival this weekend, and three concerts at the Gramercy Theater, by Appetite for Destruction, a Guns N’ Roses tribute band the rock band Black Pistol Fire and YG, a popular rapper. “In light of last week’s tragic events, we are acting with an overabundance of caution and coordinating a   strategy with the New York Police Department that may also include a curfew,” Jim Yeager, a spokesman for Live Nation, said in a statement issued on Wednesday. “Because these discussions with the N. Y. P. D. are ongoing, we will be postponing a few of our upcoming shows at Irving Plaza and the Gramercy. ” But the police contradicted Live Nation’s statement. “The organization’s decision to cancel the event was in no way influenced by the N. Y. P. D.,” Sophia Mason, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement. The cancellations came as the New York concert halls struggled to deal with the aftermath of the shooting, with security checks at some venues becoming much more rigorous than usual. A clip from a security camera video shows Troy Ave, a Brooklyn rapper whose real name is Roland Collins, firing a gun backstage at Irving Plaza on May 25. He was charged on Monday with attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon he pleaded not guilty. One of Mr. Collins’s bodyguards, Ronald McPhatter, 33, was killed in the episode, and Mr. Collins was shot in the leg. A police official who declined to be named because of the continuing investigation said on Tuesday that three guns were found in a car used to drive Mr. Collins to the hospital. Investigators believe one of the guns is the same weapon that Mr. Collins was seen firing in the video and that was used to kill Mr. McPhatter, but they are awaiting confirmation from ballistics tests, the official said. If the tests show that the gun Mr. Collins fired was the one that killed Mr. McPhatter, Mr. Collins will also be charged with murder, the official said. Mr. Collins’s lawyers have claimed that he was acting in   and said he did not shoot himself or Mr. McPhatter. The police have said until now that they are not seeking a second suspect, but that could change based on results of the tests. Live Nation offered no details about rescheduled dates for the postponed concerts, but by Wednesday afternoon, some of the performers were already making other plans. Black Pistol Fire, which was to play on Saturday at the Gramercy, said it was moving its show to Saint Vitus in Brooklyn the same night. Appetite for Destruction said it would play at the Gramercy on Aug. 12. Joey Badass, a    rapper from Brooklyn, told his fans via Twitter on Wednesday to meet him elsewhere in the city. “They cancelled my show tmrw,” he wrote, “so we gon party. ”",0
20025,20025,Emmy Nominations 2016: ‘Game of Thrones’ Rules Again - The New York Times,John Koblin,"It will feel like a familiar affair at the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards, with “Game of Thrones,” “Modern Family” and Julia   once again landing nominations on Thursday. But the occasionally stodgy Emmys, which sometimes latch on to winners (like Ms.  ) and stay with them, was also infused with new blood. Popular shows like “The People v. O. J. Simpson,” “Roots’’ and “Fargo” drew attention to the limited series category, James Corden emerged as a force in the   competition, and there was recognition in the best drama category for the widely praised but previously overlooked “The Americans. ” “Game of Thrones,” HBO’s fantasy epic, will again be the leader of the pack heading into the awards. The drama, which just completed its sixth season, received 23 nominations, the highest total for any show. The show received 24 nominations last year and won its first best drama Emmy. [ List: Nominations for the 2016 Emmy Awards ] HBO, which is coming off its biggest Emmy haul ever last year, had a total of 94 nominations, the highest of any network for the 16th consecutive year. FX’s   limited series “The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story” and its anthology series “Fargo” were the   and   nominated shows. FX finished behind HBO in nominations with 56. The streaming services Netflix and Amazon continue to make significant inroads, with each scoring its highest Emmy nomination totals (54 for Netflix and 16 for Amazon). The Emmys reflect an infusion of talent into television at a time when movie stars are increasingly turning to TV, especially in limited series, and there are more scripted shows than ever before. Over the past few months, networks have been ferociously competing against one another in nomination campaigns. The broadcast networks are still experiencing a diminished presence at the Emmys, with three of the networks  —   ABC, Fox and CBS  —   notching fewer nominations than in 2015. NBC had the same total, with 41. And for the fifth consecutive year, the networks were shut out of nominations for best drama. In that category, “Game of Thrones” will compete against the final season of the PBS show “Downton Abbey,” USA’s “Mr. Robot,” AMC’s “Better Call Saul,” Netflix’s “House of Cards,” FX’s “The Americans” and Showtime’s “Homeland. ” “Mr. Robot,” which won the Golden Globe for best drama in January, is a new entrant in the category, along with “The Americans. ” They replace “Mad Men,” which ended last year, and Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black. ” HBO’s “Veep,” which last year ended the   winning streak of ABC’s “Modern Family’’ in the best comedy category, was once again nominated for that award. It will go up against “Modern Family” again, along with Netflix’s “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” Amazon’s “Transparent,” HBO’s “Silicon Valley,” ABC’s “ ” and Netflix’s “Master of None. ” With Jon Hamm’s Don Draper from “Mad Men” out of the race, the best actor category for drama has no clear  . Two previous Emmy winners, Kyle Chandler (“Bloodline”) and Bob Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”) will compete against Kevin Spacey (“House of Cards”) Liev Schreiber (“Ray Donovan”) Matthew Rhys (“The Americans”) and Rami Malek (“Mr. Robot”) all of whom are looking for their first Emmy. Viola Davis, who last year became the first   woman to win a best acting Emmy in the drama category, will try to repeat, for her performance in “How to Get Away With Murder. ” She is up against Robin Wright (“House of Cards”) Keri Russell (“The Americans”) Tatiana Maslany (“Orphan Black”) Claire Danes (“Homeland”) and Taraji P. Henson (“Empire”). Ms. Russell is the only new actress in the category, and this represents her first Emmy nomination. FX’s Emmy haul was propelled by “The People v. O. J. Simpson,” “Fargo” and “The Americans. ” “The People v. O. J. Simpson” received a whopping six nominations in the limited series acting categories, including one for Sarah Paulson, who was also nominated for her role in FX’s “American Horror Story: Hotel. ” Ms. Paulson, who portrayed the prosecutor Marcia Clark in “The People v. O. J. Simpson,” said in an interview that she shot both roles at the same time and that she was “running on fumes, just as Marcia was. ” She added, “I used all of my exhaustion to my benefit since no one was more tired during that trial than Marcia Clark. ” Another standout on Thursday was   Emmy winner Laurie Metcalf, who was nominated for three awards: for best actress in a comedy series for HBO’s “Getting On” and for guest appearances in “The Big Bang Theory” and “Horace and Pete. ” Netflix had a strong day, with nominations in both the lead drama and comedy categories and in several acting categories. With 54 nominations, Netflix has 20 more than it received last year, its previous record. “Making a Murderer,” the popular Netflix documentary, was nominated for six awards, including best documentary series. This is the first year that Netflix eclipsed each of the broadcast networks. Amazon was led by its comedy “Transparent,” which had 10 nominations. Last year, the show’s star, Jeffrey Tambor, won the best actor award, the first time a streaming service had won a lead acting Emmy. For the first time in 16 years, “The Daily Show” was not nominated in the best variety show category, a blow to its rookie host, Trevor Noah. Likewise, Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show” was snubbed, while Mr. Corden’s “The Late Late Show” was honored instead. The nomination will add fuel to the discussion that Mr. Corden is outshining his more experienced CBS colleague. Rounding out the category were HBO’s John Oliver, ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, HBO’s Bill Maher, NBC’s Jimmy Fallon and Crackle’s “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee” with Jerry Seinfeld. Unlike the Academy Awards, which have overhauled the membership ranks following controversy over its   slate of acting nominees, the Emmys have a relatively diverse lineup, with a number of actors of color receiving nominations. Last year, the Emmys made changes to the voting process, opening up the best drama and comedy categories to all Television Academy voters, not just a committee. “Game of Thrones,” which has never been more popular, has probably been a beneficiary to the rules change. In the comedy acting categories, Ms.   is up again for her performance in “Veep. ” She has won the award four years in a row (and has seven Emmys over all). She will be competing against Ms. Metcalf, Amy Schumer (“Inside Amy Schumer”) Lily Tomlin (“Grace and Frankie”) Tracee Ellis Ross (“ ”) and Ellie Kemper (“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”). Mr. Tambor will be up against Anthony Anderson (“ ”) Aziz Ansari (“Master of None”) Will Forte (“The Last Man on Earth”) William H. Macy (“Shameless”) and Thomas Middleditch (“Silcon Valley”). Though television has never been more celebrated as an art form, drawing a sizable audience for the Emmys remains something of a challenge: Last year’s show was its lowest rated ever.  The Emmys will be hosted this year by Mr. Kimmel and will be broadcast on Sept. 18 on ABC.",0

20028,20028,"White House Petition To Remove ‘Soros-Owned Voting Machines’ Hits 100,000+ Signatures",Quest,"We Are Change 

The White House website features a petition to remove thousands of voting machines supposedly tied to billionaire Democrat George Soros from 16 states. The petition reached well over 100,000 signatures as of Friday night.
The petition’s supporters want to make sure Congress convenes to ban those machines by November. Lifezette first reported that the machines could be linked to Soros, by asserting the man that owns that sold the machines serves the board of the Open Societies Foundation, a board led by Soros.
“This man has been linked to a person’s campaign who is running in the election and has a clear bias to one candidate. His ownership of voting machines in 16 states is a clear breach of integrity of our electoral system,” the petition states. The machines were tied to Soros by The Epoch Times, which reported the company that sold the machines is owned by a Soros ally.
Business Insider reported Tuesday, that notions of Soros controlling the machines is false, because Soros doesn’t have a controlling interest in the company that sold the machines, claiming that the 16 states to purchase the machines don’t plan to use them in the 2016 general election.
This amount of signatures make it clear that a large amount of people have a lot distrust in the current election system.

20029,20029,Watch: Celebrities Beg Congress to ’Obstruct’ Donald Trump,Jerome Hudson,"A group of Hollywood celebrities is urging Americans and the United States Congress to come together to “obstruct”   Donald Trump’s legislative agenda. [A who’  of stars  —   including actresses Sally Field and Rosie Perez, Westworld star Jeffrey Wright, comedian   Key, Boardwalk Empire actor Steve Buscemi and other activists  —   appear in the video released Tuesday, titled “#StandUpForUS. ”   “We demand that you block nominees who threaten the rights of women, the LGBT community, people of color, immigrants and the poor,” Key and Field say in the video. The message is meant to encourage the “dear members of Congress,” the entertainers say, to “vigorously oppose” Trump’s “racist, sexist,           policies. ” “The majority of Americans, regardless of who they voted for, did not vote for racism, for sexism, or for xenophobia. And yet, Donald Trump won,” the various stars recite. Supporters are asked to spread the video on social media and sign a petition posted on the   website MoveOn. org. “We won’t remain silent. We’ll work harder to mobilize our votes, and our communities. But we need you and expect you to have our backs,” the stars and activists say. It’s the first   political PSA of the year, after a number of similar videos were released in the   to November’s presidential election. Last month, actor Martin Sheen led a group of celebrities in a video PSA which urged Republican electors in the Electoral College to ignore their states’ voting results and vote to deny Donald Trump the presidency.

20031,20031,Life: Environmental Win! Poland Spring Is Fighting Plastic Waste With A Campaign Highlighting The Disgusting Flavor Of Its Bottled Water,nan,"Email 
It should come as no surprise that the $100 billion bottled-water industry is pretty much the polar opposite of environmental sustainability. Fortunately, one of the biggest producers of bottled water is taking some real action to go green: Poland Spring is fighting the accumulation of plastic waste with a new campaign that highlights how terrible their bottled water tastes. 
Now here is a company that gets it. 
“We just want to get the word out that our crystal-clear water tastes truly awful,” said Janet Connor, senior VP of marketing for Poland Spring. “Every year, 38 billion plastic water bottles are thrown out. In order to minimize the impact we have on the environment, we wanted to remind people that drinking our fresh spring water is an unpleasant ordeal from the first sip to the last. Given the option, it would be a better idea to drink hot wolf piss.” 
As part of the campaign, Poland Spring is marshaling their full resources behind the effort, including print and billboard placements that advertise their water as “a miserable experience for your mouth.” To support these efforts, social campaigns using the hashtag #MyPolandSpringTastesLike will encourage users to share the first time they tried the company’s bottled water, and to pull no punches when it comes to describing the excruciating flavor. 
Poland Spring has even updated its website to reflect their new focus: 
Wow! What a huge win for the environment! It’s nice to see that the folks at Poland Spring are willing to describe their product as Satan’s vomit if it means making this planet a better place. Way to go!",1
20032,20032,Economic Racial Disparity in North Carolina,Patrick Carr,"Email 
While the recent police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott has led to increased scrutiny on police activities in North Carolina, police-community relations are not the only reason racial tensions are flaring. While encounters with police officers can radically differ depending on the race of those involved, access to economic resources tend to follow a similar pattern. Although racial gaps regarding wealth, incomes, and healthcare are nationwide issues, observing them from a statewide perspective can help understand why specific communities feel maltreated. 
A UNC Chapel Hill study found that the income and wealth disparities between African Americans and whites in North Carolina are far worse than the national average. It states that: 
…black households, at the median, claim only about 13 percent of the wealth and, stunningly, about 4 percent of the net worth of white households. The corresponding figures for the nation are bleak: 15 and 13 percent respectively. Median wealth for white households is roughly seven times that of black households…Nationally, black households have about half the home equity of whites. In North Carolina, it’s about a third. 
The study goes on to state that half of all black households in North Carolina have under $100 in savings. At the median, black heads of household aged between 50 and 65 own $17,000 in assets compared to white households’ median of $143,000, which seriously hampers older, black workers from retiring comfortably. This data paints a picture of a state that fails to allow black communities from advancing economically and obtaining some semblance of equality. 
The issue is further exasperated by lack of access to health insurance. A North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services study found that 13% of North Carolina whites have no health insurance as compared to 22% of blacks. 16% of whites were reported to be in “fair or poor” health as compared to 23.2% of blacks. The Kaiser Family Foundation research shows that the majority of non-elderly uninsured North Carolinians were minorities: 30% Hispanic and 14% black, while 10% were white. This is especially concerning considering minorities experience disease at a higher rate than American whites, and visit the doctor at much lower rates. The result: communities most in need of medical assistance are least likely to attain it. 
This imbalance is in part due to the state government’s failure to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, something which would have significantly reduced the coverage gap between those receiving Medicaid and those obtaining income-based subsidies. The North Carolina Justice Center finds that, had the expansion gone through, 500,000 low-income North Carolinians would have health insurance who currently don’t have it, and over 1,000 unnecessary deaths would have been prevented. 
While the protests in Charlotte appeared to be a backlash against apparent police brutality, underlying economic factors also come into play. A breaking point will eventually be reached by those living in undesirable economic situations which they view as consequential of a racist and unfair system. The case of North Carolina is a particularly negative one, but the principles outlined in this research are not unique to North Carolina. Americans cannot expect race relations to cool until access to income, wealth, and healthcare are equalized and structured in a fair, equitable manner.",1

20035,20035,Hillary's Hypocrisy On Sexual Assault BRUTALLY Exposed | The Federalist Papers,Tfpp Writer,"Pinterest 
C.E. Dyer reports that actor James Woods posted a powerful video on Twitter about what happened on Highway 265 in Arkansas over four decades ago that Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton doesn’t want people to know about. 
The video chronicled the rape of a 12-year-old Arkansas girl, Kathy Shelton, that occurred on May 10, 1975 when two men lured the girl into their car and brutally assaulted her. 
— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) September 20, 2016 
This video details the horrific attack…and the actions of the attorney who defended one of the rapists: Hillary Clinton. 
According to the video, child was raped and beaten so brutally that she spent five days in a coma and was left unable to bear children. 
A local paper mill worker, 41-year-old Thomas Alfred Taylor, was charged with the rape. Then Hillary Rodham became his attorney. 
Taylor had semen mixed with the 12-year-old victim’s blood in his underwear, proving that he committed the crime. In court, Hillary maligned the rape victim’s character in order to defend her monster of a client. 
From the video: “Taylor’s attorney went to extraordinary lengths to discredit the child victim, suppressing all oral, written and physical evidence, forcing the 12-year-old to submit to polygraphs and psychiatric evaluations, even accusing the child (who had been a virgin until the attack) of seeking out older men and ‘fantasizing’ her rape.” 
The victim has recently come forward to talk about how Hillary’s lies ruined her life, which after the trial spiraled into a struggle with drugs and prison time. 
Shelton, who has already been put through a truly horrific nightmare, had to hear the tapes released in which Hillary laughed about the trial. 
Hillary laughed, on tape, about a trial of a man who brutally raped a 12-year old girl and subsequently received less than a year in prison for his horrific crime. 
Shelton has decided to speak out about her nightmare at the hands of Hillary Rodham. The video ends with a message from Shelton to Clinton, “You lied about me. You took me through Hell.” 
Clinton has claimed that she had an obligation to defend Taylor, but she is wrong; she did not have to do what she did. What she put a 12-year-old rape victim through is beyond the pale. 
Liberals regularly talk about victim blaming and rape culture in America, but where is the outrage about what Clinton did to a 12-year-old rape victim as a defense attorney? 
What else is there to say really? If you can watch that video and not be utterly and completely disgusted with Clinton, well, God help you. ",1

You see, federal obstruction of justice in and of itself is a felony that carries a prison sentence of up to 5 years.

20037,20037,Donald Trump And His Supporters Are Fighting A Rigged System,Michael Sebastian,"At the third debate, Donald Trump was asked if he would accept the results of the election. Trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it. The media went berserk claiming that Trump was undermining democracy. But is the US system really rigged? And if it is, can Trump overcome it?
Why rig the system? The elite realize that their time is short.
Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. Revelation 12:12
It is human nature to want to accumulate wealth. It is also human nature to want to keep what you have. One of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them. A democratic republic is particularly easy to influence. The wealthy elite can “buy” candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs. They can make voting patterns more favorable to them by changing the country’s demographics. Or they can influence voters through the supposedly unbiased news media that they control. In the US, the wealthy elite use every one of these levers to rig the system.
For example, liberal voters often favor a progressive tax system where high earners pay greater percentages than those who earn less. It sounds like a populist policy but it is not. Progressive taxation is put in place to prevent middle class people from rising into the ranks of the truly wealthy who have already accumulated their wealth and are taxed at the much lower capital gains rate. Progressive taxation keeps the rich on top and keeps the plebs down. That’s why no matter which political party is in power, we are still stuck with progressive taxation.
Everything goes well as long as both parties don’t rock the boat. But once you get a true wildcard like Trump, the system must spring into action to stop the threat to the established order. That’s what we are seeing now. The elite are using every tool in the arsenal of the rigged system to ensure Trump does not upset their gravy train. The elite sense their time is short.

The first way in which the election is rigged is through voter fraud. In his Gettysburg address, Trump outlined some of the ways in which this occurs:
According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations that in the US that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate. 1.8 million dead people are registered to vote, and some of them are voting. I wonder how that happens? 2.8 million people are registered to vote in more than one state. These are numbers folks. These are numbers. 14% of noncitizens are registered to vote.
Liberals always object to any sort of voter identification requirement. They say that it negatively affects minority voters, who may not have any identification. But this is obvious nonsense. The real reason liberals oppose voter identification is because it would make voter fraud more difficult.
By raising concerns about voter fraud, Trump is firing a warning shot. He is saying that he will fight voter fraud, unlike prior GOP candidates who preferred defeat to calling out cheating by the other side. Simply putting the Democrats on notice may cause them to cheat less than they would have otherwise. The only question is whether Trump will be able to muster enough votes to overcome the amount of cheating that will take place.
The Lügenpresse 
A second way that the system is rigged is through the legacy news media. These include the three oldest television news networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) as well as the newer ones (CNN, MSNBC, Fox). It also includes the remaining newspapers, especially the New York Times, Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal. Of these, the only ones that are reliably conservative are Fox and the WSJ, both of which are owned by Rupert Murdock. But even here, it is more accurate to call Fox and the WSJ “neoliberal” rather than conservative as they both push the globalist message of open borders and unenforced trade.
Trump is very media savvy. He’s been in the public eye since the 1980s and his philosophy has been that no publicity is bad publicity. Trump has used this to highlight his policies. By making controversial statements, he has been able to force the media to cover his positions. Still, the nonstop smear campaign has hurt Trump’s numbers particularly among older voters who still get their news from legacy sources.
New media outlets like Return of Kings, Breitbart, and Danger & Play have been more favorable to Trump but the most highly funded new media such as Daily Beast, Heat Street, Buzzfeed, and Huffington Post all push the globalist message. The end result that Trump is fighting an ocean of disinformation with only a handful of allies by his side.
Voter Discouragement Fivethirtyeight doing its best to discourage Trump voters.
Another way that that system is rigged is that the legacy media conspires to discourage Trump voters from going to the polls. One way they do this is to over poll Democrats to make it look like Trump is losing. For example, one recent poll placed Hillary 12 points higher than Trump. But even Obama was only able to beat McCain by 7 points even though he was packing stadiums of 70,000 people. And Hillary doesn’t command the sort of adulation that Obama did in 2008.
There is a huge motivation gap between Trump and Clinton. Recently, Trump held a rally in Tampa where 28,000 people showed up. Some of these people waited in line for 12 hours for the chance to see Trump. A day later, Hillary hosted a rally in Florida where only 1000 people showed up. And some of those were likely paid plants. Her running mate Tim Kaine did even worse barely getting 30 people to show up for one of his events.
One day before the Brexit vote, polls showed Remain leading by 10 points. Leave ended up winning by 3.5 points.
Why does the legacy media report polls that show Trump losing by a landslide? Because it is designed to dishearten Trump voters.
Conclusion Will Trump be able to overcome the rigged system? It will be a heroic achievement if he does. One thing is certain: This is not the time to give up but to fight with all of our might. The elites want us to be discouraged, to give up hope, to lie down and die. That is the one thing we will never do. Even if the host of hell rise up to oppose you, go to the ballot box on November 8th. Regardless of what you may hear otherwise, your life will be very different under President Trump than it will be under globalist pawn Hillary.
Win or lose, our battle to bring back the patriarchy will not end on November 8 th . A Trump victory would give us breathing room to start restoring our society in the open. A Hillary victory, heaven forbid, would signal that our work will need to be underground. Either way, our battle is just beginning. In future columns I will outline the way forward for traditional men.

20038,20038,Why We Expect Health Disclosures From Presidential Candidates - The New York Times,Michael Barbaro,"As with so many elements of this presidential campaign, the way in which Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump have handled their medical histories feels strange, secretive and theatrical (Dr. Oz, anyone? ). But there’s a long and rich history of candidates concealing  —   even lying about  —   the details of their health. In the latest episode of The   we talk to John Dickerson, a history buff, columnist at Slate and moderator of CBS’s “Face the Nation,” who recalls the United States’ pivotal brush with a president’s   ailment: the heart attack of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955. Mr. Dickerson, the author of “Whistlestop,” a new book about the history of presidential campaigns, explains how the White House’s initial resistance to disclose the incident triggered something new in American public life: a deluge of deeply private medical information about the commander in chief. We also speak with the doctor who, more than anyone else, is responsible for our modern expectation that candidates give detailed disclosures about their health: Lawrence K. Altman, a reporter at The New York Times who was the first to interview candidates about their medical histories. Mr. Altman recalls his tough and sadly prescient question to Ronald Reagan when he was a candidate in 1980 about a potential condition that would later haunt him. We also hear from voters in Times Square about whether they even care about candidates’ health. Short answer: not particularly. One voter told us he’d be going with Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Trump. Was there anything about her health that might change that? “I’m pretty sure he’s crazy,” the man said, “and that’s more dangerous than her dying in office. ” From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.

20039,20039,"Trump Warns of Potential ’Major, Major Conflict with North Korea’",John Hayward,"On Thursday, during an Oval Office interview with Reuters, President Trump said: “There is a chance that we could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea. Absolutely. ”[“We’d love to solve things diplomatically but it’s very difficult,” the president added.  China will clearly play a major role in that   diplomatic resolution, as Trump suggested he would not anger Beijing with another phone call to Taiwan’s president. He explicitly stated he wanted to avoid “causing difficulty” for Chinese President Xi Jinping while he is “doing everything in his power to help us with a big situation. ” He praised Xi as a “good man” who is “trying very hard” to avoid “turmoil and death” on the Korean peninsula. “He is a very good man and I got to know him very well,” said Trump. “With that being said, he loves China and he loves the people of China. I know he would like to be able to do something, perhaps it’s possible that he can’t. ” Trump was also surprisingly sympathetic to North Korean dictator Kim  . “He’s 27 years old. His father dies, took over a regime. So say what you want but that is not easy, especially at that age,” he said of Kim. “I’m not giving him credit or not giving him credit, I’m just saying that’s a very hard thing to do. As to whether or not he’s rational, I have no opinion on it. I hope he’s rational. ” On the other hand, Trump played hardball with South Korea, saying that he intends to renegotiate its   deal with the U. S. “very soon,” and seek compensation for the $1 billion cost of deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)   shield to Seoul. “It is unacceptable, it is a horrible deal made by Hillary. It’s a horrible deal, and we are going to renegotiate that deal or terminate it,” he said of the Korean trade deal, formally known as KORUS, referring to his defeated 2016 presidential opponent and onetime Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He said it would be much easier to terminate KORUS than the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he has also strongly criticized. “With the Korean deal, we terminate and it’s over. I will do that unless we make a fair deal. We’re getting destroyed in Korea,” he said. According to the Washington Post, the South Korean Trade Ministry stated on Friday that it has no plans to renegotiate the agreement, whose anniversary occurs next week. The United States is currently running a $27. 7 billion trade deficit in goods with South Korea. When Reuters asked when he planned to announce this surprising review of South Korea trade policy, Trump replied, “I’m announcing it now. ” This did not go over well in South Korea, where stocks and currency values immediately tumbled. Among other market indicators, shares in Hyundai Motor dropped by as much as 2. 4 percent, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index slid 0. 1 percent, and the South Korean won dropped 0. 2 percent against the dollar. These would seem more like signs of unease than panic. Analysts told CNBC Trump’s remarks came as a surprise, but most of the South Korean market and its foreign investors await firmer announcements of the Trump administration’s intentions before concluding a trade war is brewing. A foreign policy adviser to the favored candidate in the upcoming emergency South Korea presidential election, Moon   said asking South Korea to pay for THAAD was an “impossible option. ” Moon is already known as a skeptic of THAAD deployment, with his campaign describing the decision of his impeached predecessor Park   to install the system “strongly regrettable” and “very inappropriate” because she did not properly consult with parliament. Moon has called for an immediate halt to the deployment of the THAAD system, which has increased tensions between South Korea and China. Chinese boycotts over THAAD have cost South Korea enough money to raise concerns about the future of South Korea’s economic recovery. China objects to the deployment because it believes THAAD’s powerful radars will be employed to spy on Chinese activity. The New York Times quotes Moon spokespersons describing Trump’s demand for payment as validation of their criticism that Park’s administration was not honest with the Korean people about the costs and drawbacks of the missile shield.",0
20040,20040,Mike Lee: GOP Health Care Bill Does Very Little to Bring Premiums Down - Breitbart,Pam Key,"Tuesday on CNN’s “The Situation Room,” Sen. Mike Lee ( ) said the proposed House Republican health care legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare does “very little at all” that would bring premiums down.  Lee said, “I think he’s wrong especially if what he’s suggesting is that we have conservative policies in this bill that will bring down the cost of health care. Look, one of the things that has caused the cost of health care to spike so significantly is the regulatory section of the Affordable Care Act, which has put insurance companies in a position where they’ve increased their premiums and the cost of health care across the board has gone up. ” “This bill does far too little about that,” he continued. “It does very little at all, that would bring premiums down. And that’s the concern I have with it, is what this would do to the cost of health care. We have to bring that under control. This bill doesn’t do that to a degree sufficient for me to vote for it. ” (  Grabien) Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
20041,20041,The Guggenheim’s Greatest Hits Come Roaring Back - The New York Times,Holland Cotter,"Of New York City’s major museum collections, the Guggenheim’s is the hardest to see, because so little of it is usually on view. Blame Frank Lloyd Wright’s design, that big empty well of light and air with a little art up the sides. Not that I object to the building. I’ve adored it since my first visit as an    kid in 1960, the year after it opened. There was art on the ramps then, but all I remember is thinking: spaceship. Still do. But now, as if answering a hunger  —   maybe its own  —   to see what that spaceship originally held, the museum brings us “Visionaries: Creating a Modern Guggenheim,” a permanent collection show that fills the rotunda. The 170 works  —   mostly paintings, with a few sculptures, including a   Calder mobile dropped from on high  —   add up to a classic   display, which could be a snooze, but in this case isn’t because a lot of these greatest hits really are great, and some of the less familiar stuff is too. The installation is a pleasure: neat, clean, linear, up the ramp, with an optional detour into the Thannhauser wing (always permanent holdings turf). No need to consult floor plans. No wandering off course. If your visiting time is short, shift into   drive, head straight uphill and you’ll be done in under an hour. The main route, which starts on Ramp 2, is broadly chronological. It begins with a   landscape by Camille Pissarro, “The Hermitage at Pontoise,” from around 1867, the collection’s earliest work. It ends several ramps later, under the skylight, with Jackson Pollock’s big, tarry 1947 “Alchemy,” an archaeological dig of a picture, on view in New York for the first time in 50 years (after a painstaking restoration that removed decades of grime). But right off the rotunda floor, before you begin your climb, you undergo a kind of modernist baptism by fire: an eruption of color, line and utopian emotion generated by 10 Vasily Kandinsky paintings. Kandinsky is the Guggenheim’s house artist, the one whose work it owns in the greatest depth, and whose spiritualizing sensibility most closely reflects the institution’s founding aspirations. Solomon R. Guggenheim ( ) a New York industrialist and seasoned collector of old masters, probably never heard of Kandinsky until around 1927, when, at his wife’s insistence, he had his portrait done. The painter she hired was a German artist named Hilla Rebay  —   born Baroness Hildegard Anna Augusta Elisabeth Rebay von Ehrenwiesen  —   who had recently arrived in New York. Rebay had strange, figureless paintings and collages, some of which she’d made, on her studio walls. And she began telling her sitter about wonderful kinds of new art coming out of Europe: abstract art  —   she called it nonobjective  —   that reached for the spiritual realm. Guggenheim liked what he heard, and he liked a gamble, and, at age 68, decided to go with this one. The conversion was quick. Out went the old masters and, under Rebay’s guidance, in came some zany new ones, Kandinsky among them. By 1930, Guggenheim, guided by Rebay, had bought hundreds of pictures and was inviting people to his apartment in the Plaza Hotel to see them. In 1937, 80 years ago, he gave his collection institutional heft by setting up the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. A publicly accessible home for the work  —   the Museum of   Painting  —   followed in 1939, with Rebay as director. And 20 years later came the Guggenheim Museum we have today. From an early point, its modernist collection represented the contributions, through sale, purchase or gifts, of several people. Look at the labels for the 10 introductory Kandinskys. The names of some of the original owners are noted. They, along with Guggenheim and Rebay, are the “visionaries” of the show’s title. Two of them, Karl Nierendorf and Justin K. Thannhauser, were German art dealers who moved to New York before, or during, World War II. Another figure, Katherine S. Dreier, was an artist and a private collector with progressive tastes. And a vital contributor was family: Peggy Guggenheim, Solomon’s   “art addict” niece. It is around these figures, and their art, that the exhibition, organized by the Guggenheim curator Megan Fontanella, with Ylinka Barotto, a curatorial assistant, is loosely built. Thannhauser, an important   European dealer in early modern French painting, was the original owner of the Pissarro landscape. He was pushed by war from Berlin to Paris and finally to New York in 1941. With no children to carry on his business, he consigned much of his art to the Guggenheim Foundation, including resplendent Gauguin landscapes, Seurat pastorals, a cache of van Gogh letters and a group of unusually interesting  —   because unusual  —   Picassos. His compatriot, Nierendorf, came to New York on a holiday jaunt in the late 1930s and stayed. He was a crucial figure in the developing museum: He represented Kandinsky in America, and had close ties to Paul Klee. When Nierendorf died suddenly in 1947, the Guggenheim Foundation bought his estate. Dozens of works by Klee came with it, and seven of them are part of what amounts to a Klee   that is one of the true    highlights of the show. Rebay loved Klee, and bought a gorgeous little   abstract grid painting  —   it looks like a dollhouse version of an Ardabil carpet  —   for herself. Like much of the rest of her personal collection, it eventually went to the museum, though her contribution to the institution was already incalculably huge. Basically, she created it in its early stages. And, with her theosophical interests and radical eye, she shaped it in ways that Guggenheim on his own might not have. (But even she couldn’t sell him on Mondrian.) Rightfully, many of her own works entered the holdings, and two of her abstract collages are on view: vivacious, disciplined, beautiful. Dreier, an American of German descent, was an artist too. She participated in the 1913 Armory show, where she met Marcel Duchamp. In 1920, joined by Man Ray, they founded the Société Anonyme to buy and exhibit new and difficult art. Independently wealthy, Dreier took collecting as seriously as most people do a profession. She made it her career and amassed astonishing holdings. The bulk of Société Anonyme material is at Yale, but the Guggenheim got some treasures: a zesty Schwitters collage, a Mondrian, and a madly complex Duchamp ink study of a chess match drawn on what looks like a cocktail napkin. The show ends with objects from the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice. The daughter of Solomon’s brother Benjamin, who died on the Titanic, Peggy combined the work of several visionaries in one, as an art dealer, a museum builder and a lavish shopper  —   her stated intention was to “buy a picture a day”  —   with extremely eclectic tastes. Paintings in the show that belonged to her range from a rigorous geometric abstraction by Kazimir Malevich to a   Surrealist tableau by Max Ernst (her second husband). The dominant energy comes from Pollock, who was working as a maintenance man at the Museum of   Painting when Peggy Guggenheim, in a dealer phase, offered to pay him to make paintings full time. He did, and she got a lot of them. The three at the very top of the ramp are explosive the way the Kandinskys are below. She claimed Pollock as her great discovery, which he was, and still is, though the show yields plenty of other discoveries: Joseph Cornell assemblages, Franz Marc horses and cows, and splendid things by artists  —   Claire Falkenstein, Perle Fine, Alice Trumbull Mason, Maria Helena Vieira da Silva  —   you rarely see. You may miss them on a quick visit. But there’s plenty of time to return. “Visionaries” will be in place for nearly six months, until September, and even for a collection show, that doesn’t sound too long. Of the 170 pieces in the Guggenheim’s permanent collection survey, a few stand out: PAUL KLEE “Horizon, Zenith and Atmosphere,” 1925. Klee and Vasily Kandinsky both worked at the Bauhaus. Both had mystical temperaments. Both were artists collected by all the early Guggenheim “visionaries. ” Yet their work was very different, in scale and tone. This little Klee piece, with its radiant graphic lines and color sprayed from an atomizer, is in an aesthetic and spiritual world entirely its own. VAN GOGH “Landscape With Snow,” 1888. Feeling harassed and jostled by life in Paris, in the winter of 1888 van Gogh headed south for Arles, hoping to find balmy weather and congenial artist friends. He found neither. Arles had been hit by freak snowstorms. Standoffish locals were the only people around. Van Gogh went to work, and painted a bleak frosted field as oceanic garden. FRANZ MARC “Stables,” 1913. Marc painted some of the most empathetic depictions of animals since Dürer’s. As time went on, his view of the world grew more encompassing and cohesive. In “Stables,” his final picture of horses, nature and architecture harmoniously interlock. In 1916, at 36, he was killed in action during World War I. BRANCUSI “Little French Girl,” circa  . For Hilla Rebay, sculpture, as a medium, wasn’t spiritual enough, and this delightfully kooky early Brancusi is one of the few sculptures in the Guggenheim show. Influenced by African art that Brancusi had studied in Paris museums, it ended up in the Connecticut living room of Katherine S. Dreier. ALICE TRUMBULL MASON “Emergent Form,” 1945. An American painter and printmaker, Mason ( ) studied in New York with Arshile Gorky and went through geometric, then biomorphic phases, which she combines in this insouciant piece. An ardent nonobjectivist, she signed this painting twice, in different places, to indicate it had no fixed orientation. JACKSON POLLOCK “Alchemy,” 1947. Pollock’s great painting is a fitting punctuation to the show. Historically, it feels like both the beginning and the end of something big. It’s being seen here for the first time in years in more ways than one. To get a sense of the extensive conservation work done on it, check out “Jackson Pollock: Exploring ‘Alchemy’” in the Guggenheim’s Sackler Center for Arts Education.",0
20042,20042,"Standing Rock Pipeline Protesters, Ordered to Leave, Dig In - The New York Times",Jack Healy,"CANNON BALL, N. D.  —   Lee Plenty Wolf knows the government wants him to clear out of the snowbound tepee where he stokes the fire, sings traditional Oglala songs and sleeps alongside a pair of women from France and California who came to protest an oil pipeline in the stinging cold. But he and thousands of other protesters are vowing to make what may be their last stand at Standing Rock. The orders to evacuate the sprawling protest camp on this frozen prairie just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation came down last week from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and the North Dakota governor’s office. After four months of prayer marches and clashes with law enforcement officials who responded with tear gas and water cannons, the protesters now have until Monday to leave. The government said it would not forcibly remove anyone, but could cite people for trespassing or other offenses. At the camp, defiance is rising like smoke from the stovepipe of Mr. Plenty Wolf’s tepee. People are here to stay. They are building yurts and hammering together plywood for bunkhouses and lodges. The communal kitchen stops serving dinner at 9:30 p. m. it reopens a   later as a sleeping space. “I ain’t going nowhere,” Mr. Plenty Wolf said one night as he cradled a   drum and reflected on grievances that run deeper than groundwater among Native Americans here. “We’re getting tired of being pushed for 500 years. They’ve been taking, taking, taking, and enough’s enough. ” The approaching deadline to leave the camps and the dwindling days of President Obama’s term create a feeling that any opportunity to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is fading. The fight has drawn thousands of tribal members, veterans, activists and celebrities and transformed a frozen patch of North Dakota into a focal point for environmental and tribal activism. The main camp sits on federal lands that people at the camps say should rightfully belong to the Standing Rock Sioux under the terms of an 1851 treaty. To Mr. Plenty Wolf, closing it amounts to one more broken treaty. The Standing Rock Sioux’s concerns about an oil spill just upriver from their water source has resonated with environmentalist and   groups across the country, and dozens have rallied to support the tribes.   activists who fought the Keystone XL pipeline have also joined the protests. “Keep it in the ground” is a rallying cry on banners. Even as violent confrontations erupted in fields and along creeks and about 600 people were arrested, crews kept digging and burying the pipeline. Its   path from the oil fields of North Dakota to southern Illinois is nearly complete. Since September, the Obama administration has blocked construction on a critical section where the pipeline would burrow underneath a dammed section of the Missouri River that tribes say sits near sacred burial sites. The tribe and activists are pushing Mr. Obama to order up a yearslong environmental review or otherwise block the project before he leaves office.   Donald J. Trump said on Friday that he supported finishing the $3. 7 billion pipeline. Nobody here knows what to expect. The Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the federal land on which the main camp sits, says it wants protesters to make a “peaceful and orderly transition” out of the camps and to a “free speech zone” nearby. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier of Morton County, a critic of the protesters who leads the law enforcement response, said his officers would not go into the camps to remove people. The divide between law enforcement officials and the tribe and protesters now feels more brittle than ever. Dave Archambault II, the Standing Rock Sioux chairman, has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of civil rights violations. He criticized officers for using rubber bullets and sprays of freezing water against what he called unarmed, peaceful “water protectors. ” “I’m worried about the next confrontation,” he said. “The escalation has continued to rise. They have concertina wire all over the place. They’re almost daring the water protectors. That’s not safe. ” Sheriff Kirchmeier dismissed the claims. “I reject it all,” he said in an interview in the basement of the county offices, where stacks of snacks, fruit and juice donated by the public sat beside scuffed riot shields. “The protesters are forcing police and us into taking action. They’re committing criminal activities. ” He said protesters had used sling shots to attack officers and thrown rocks and bottles. He and other local officials continue to criticize the federal government’s response. They say the decision to delay the pipeline created months of instability that have cost Morton County $8 million. They say federal officials have offered little in the way of manpower or money to help. On Friday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said she had asked Justice Department officials who handle   issues and community policing, as well as the United States attorney for North Dakota, to help mediate. In recent days, conflicting statements from local and state officials have stirred confusion about how vigorously officials will enforce the closing of the camps. A Morton County spokeswoman initially said people could face $1, 000 fines for trying to bring supplies to the camp, only to be contradicted by a governor’s spokesman who said that North Dakota had no plans to block supplies. The authorities are still enforcing a blockade of the fastest, most direct route into the camp. But other roads  —   and supply lines  —   were still open. Pickup trucks and   carried in lumber and propane tanks, pallets of bottled water, firewood and food. A container truck managed to crawl down the icy,   ramp into camp. Cusi Ballew, a Pottawatomie member from southern Ohio making his second trip to the camp, was up on a ladder drilling pieces of plywood together to make a bunkhouse for Sioux tribal members. “Humans have been surviving winters for over 250, 000 years,” he said. “What’s important isn’t how we’re doing it but why we’re doing it. We’re here for prayer and for action. ” And more people were pouring in. Veterans’ groups were hoping to bring 2, 000 Native and   veterans to Standing Rock over the weekend. The Bismarck airport was a hive one morning: the actress Patricia Arquette could be seen heaving a suitcase off the baggage carousel the director of a   group was on the phone figuring out transportation California friends from the Burning Man festival arrived with $5, 000 worth of turmeric and medicinal herbs and oils. At the camp, children sledded down the icy hills and horses cantered through the snow, and as night fell and people clustered around campfires to cook chili and fry bread, Laurie Running Hawk made her way to a small camp by the banks of the river. In the distance were the sounds of Native men drumming and singing, and the sight of tall floodlights along a ridge that marked the path of the pipeline. Ms. Running Hawk grew up on the southern end of the Standing Rock Reservation and said she had been home from Minnesota for a powwow this summer when she and her    and    sons chanced onto one of the first major confrontations to block the pipeline. They joined in, and four months later, she was back, sleeping in a yurt with four teenagers from Minnesota who nearly froze to death on their first night in camp. “I’m here,” she said. “You’re not going to kick me out. This is my land. ”",0
20043,20043,"Pakistan Recalls Diplomats From India, Threatens to Expel Indian Envoys",Jason Ditz,"Accuses Indian Diplomats of Espionage Amid Growing Tensions   
On-again, off-again fighting between Indian and Pakistani forces in Kashmir looks to be spilling over into the diplomatic relationship between the two nations, as Pakistan has announced it will withdraw six staffers from their mission in New Dehli, and threaten to expel a number of Indian diplomats. 
The six staffers withdrawn include at least four diplomats, and Pakistani officials went on to accuse the five Indian diplomats of espionage , naming them in media reports and threatening to expel them from the country outright. 
This is a continuation of tit-for-tat expulsions which began last week, with both nations ordering a staffer out of the other’s embassy on espionage charges. The tensions are soaring with reports of heavy exchanges of fire in Kashmir over the weekend. 
India and Pakistan are never on the best of terms, but seem to get into these dust-ups once in awhile, usually around the Line of Control in Kashmir. The most recent fighting has been ongoing since August, and seems only to be getting worse as time goes on, raising concerns about a full-scale war between the two nuclear powers.  ",1
20044,20044,Comments of the Week: Here Comes Trouble,nan,"Comments of the Week: Here Comes Trouble Posted on Oct 26, 2016 torbakhopper / CC BY-ND 2.0 
As is to be expected, if not applauded, the closer we get to the Nov. 8 election, the more debates and divisions have appeared in discussions about the headlines of the moment. 
During the week that ranged from Oct. 16-23, those headlines included additional revelations from WikiLeaks’ trove of Pedesta emails regarding Hillary Clinton’s campaign, as well as various writers’ takes on how to vote this time around, and news of the ongoing Dakota Access pipeline protest. 
As for the how-to-vote issue, Jonathan Mitchell posted a short and direct comment under this story about Clinton’s famous hawkishness when it comes to envisioning and enacting American foreign policy on the world stage: 

Reader Helen Hanna, like many others who took in Robert Reich’s piece titled “The Incalculable Damage of Doing Whatever It Takes to Win,” noticed and remarked upon Reich’s gloss-over of Democratic Party leaders’, and in particular Hillary and Bill Clinton’s, proclivity for doing damage in the interest of maintaining power: 

That said, it’s not as though commenters were about to give Donald Trump a pass, either. Take Ignatius J. Reilly’s rejoinder to Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway’s “5-point plan to defeat Islam,” as Trump and his team conceived of it (and Juan Cole wrote of it): 

Touché. 
Another point of contention on the comment boards last week had to do with how to evaluate WikiLeaks’, and by extension Julian Assange’s, latest release of documents in the Pedesta emails. Though some commentators like Naomi Klein and Glenn Greenwald have spoken up about particular aspects of WikiLeaks’ current m.o., in the thread under Alexander Reed Kelly’s Truthdigger of the Week column on Assange , reader JJG noted how, like him or not, Assange and his organization are providing a public service that professionals working in the mainstream press (who are supposed to be skilled in curating and redacting sensitive material) are not generally delivering on these days: 

We’ll give Opa Westphal the last word this time, ending on an up note (in terms of the shout-out to other commenters) and a cautionary note at the same time. This one was posted under Chris Hedges’ latest column , “How Power Works”:",1

20046,20046,New PAN report warns of global contamination of health damaging glyphosate,"Ethan A. Huff, staff writer","New PAN report warns of global contamination of health damaging glyphosate 
  Ethan A. Huff, staff writer Tags: glyphosate , PAN report , toxicity (NaturalNews) The popular herbicide glyphosate, also known as Roundup, is far more toxic to humans than the chemical industry claims it is, a new report has found. The Pesticide Action Network (PAN) in a 96-page document entitled Glyphosate , reveals how people all around the world are being systemically poisoned by glyphosate, and many of them are even dying.Aerial sprayings of the chemical across crop fields are said to be safe for humans, because the so-called ""shikimate"" pathway upon which the herbicide acts exists only in plants, and not in animals or humans. But the report highlights the fact that, regardless of the supposed nonexistence of this pathway in humans, glyphosate is sill wreaking havoc on human health .Some of the acute health effects of glyphosate exposure include gastrointestinal and skin infections, headaches, blistering on the skin, rapid heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, dizziness, numbness, insomnia, blurred vision, abdominal pain, chest pains, problems breathing, respiratory problems, sore throat and strange tastes in the mouth.Other lesser-reported symptoms include problems staying balanced, cognitive abnormalities, impaired senses, muscle paralysis, peripheral neuropathy, decreased motor skills, chronic fatigue and abnormal body temperature. And none of this even touches on the long-term health effects of glyphosate exposure, which are significantly more problematic.According to the report, glyphosate directly interferes with ""numerous mammalian organs and biochemical pathways, including inhibition of numerous enzymes, metabolic disturbances and oxidative stress leading to excessive membrane lipid peroxidation, and cell and tissue damage."" Furthermore, the report highlights ""genotoxicity and endocrine disruption"" that lead to ""chronic health and developmental effects."" South American doctors confirm that glyphosate spraying is causing infertility, cancer Though U.S. doctors and health experts appear reluctant to report on their observances with glyphosate, their counterparts in South America have a lot to say on the subject. Doctors in Argentina, for instance, are reporting what's being described as a ""dramatic upsurge"" in long-term health effects where glyphosate is being sprayed on genetically-modified soybean crops.Included in the list of effects are infertility, pregnancy problems, birth defects, respiratory disease and various forms of cancer. Epidemiological studies have established a link between glyphosate exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma and DNA damage. Even at very low concentrations, glyphosate has been shown to damage vital organs like the liver and kidney, as well as skin cells.Not only is glyphosate sprayed all over food crops during the growing season to kill weeds, but it's also used as a pre-harvest desiccant to speed up the growing and harvesting process. According to the report, this process is used on wheat, cotton, various cereal grains, peas, and beans, as well as other crops.It's bad for the people who end up eating these food crops, but great for farmers and the chemical companies like Monsanto that they support when they purchase all that extra glyphosate. And the repercussions are startling. Glyphosate residues are now being found in women's breast milk, as well as in blood and urine. Even vaccines are starting to turn up as glyphosate-contaminated, which means developing babies are now being injected with this lethal poison.""The PAN Report is extremely comprehensive and really needs to be mainstreamed so that food growers, in particular, can understand the harm they are doing to crops, the soil, the environment, wildlife, pollinators, water resources and humans,"" writes Catherine J. Frompovich for Natural Blaze .""However, it will be up to consumers and farmers ... to make their concerns and priorities known about saving the planet and humankind from toxic chemicals in food, water and the air, if we are to survive toxic chemicals and their currently unavoidable poisonings.""The full PAN report is available for free online here .

20047,20047,"Todd Rundgren: ’If You’re a Trump Supporter, Don’t Come to My Show’",Daniel Nussbaum,"Todd Rundgren isn’t bothered that some of his fans might avoid his concerts due to his politics. [The    musician and record producer conceded as much in an interview with Variety when asked about an incident in which a couple walked out of a concert in Los Angeles due to comments he made about President Donald Trump.  “No,” Rundgren said when asked if it bothered him. “If I had the power, I’d say: If you’re a Trump supporter, don’t come to my show, because you won’t have a good time. And also, I don’t understand your frickin’ values. Because I’m not singing about that. If you don’t understand that basic thing, you’re just fooling yourself. ” The “Hello It’s Me” singer was talking to the magazine to promote his latest album, White Knight, which is filled with collaborations with artists such as Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor and Joe Walsh. One song on the album, “Tin Foil Hat,” is a direct jab at Trump, written and performed with Steely Dan   Donald Fagen. The lyrics reference Trump’s   descent down an escalator at Trump Tower to announce his presidential run, and add that Trump tweets “like a teenage girl” and “puts the ‘pluto’ in ‘plutocrat. ’” Rundgren is currently on a   tour, with multiple dates in Florida and Texas, states that Trump won during the 2016 campaign. But the musician told Variety that Trump supporters “will likely be offended” if they attend his concerts. “Let the buyer beware! I mean, if you can’t take a joke, or you can’t admit that you’ve made a mistake, you don’t belong with the rest of us,” he said with a laugh. Elsewhere in the interview, Rundgren explained that music is the most “plagiaristic” art when compared with other forms, because there are only so many ways musicians can arrange a limited amount of notes together. “You’ve got the western   scale. That’s essentially 11 notes. So you’re eventually going to run out of melodies, just by the pure mathematics of it,” he said. “So the whole art of making music is trying to obscure the fact that this is a melody from another song and has just been changed in subtle enough ways that you don’t recognize it. ” Read Rundgren’s full interview with Variety here.

Even by considering the possibility of impeaching Trump  —   which some conservatives, rightly, have called a “silent coup”  —   the Beltway elites are sowing division and uncertainty.

20049,20049,A Worry on the Right That Trump’s Conservative Acts Are Fleeting - The New York Times,Jeremy W. Peters,"WASHINGTON  —   When Donald J. Trump first tried a few years ago to line up a speaking slot at the marquee event for the conservative grass roots, the Conservative Political Action Conference, the organizers almost rejected him because they thought he was a fraud who only wanted a platform to promote his hotels, casinos, neckties and golf courses. Stephen K. Bannon, then the head of Breitbart News, found himself essentially blacklisted from the gathering, known as CPAC. So he started a rival conference called The Uninvited and ran it out of a hotel down the street. With Mr. Trump now ensconced in the Oval Office and Mr. Bannon, his chief strategist, right down the hall, it is hardly in dispute who won the fight for control of the Republican Party. But there are still much bigger questions about whether Mr. Trump, who has never claimed to be a conservative but so far has governed conspicuously to the right, will ultimately be loyal to conservatives’ agenda. Mr. Trump does not dwell on policy, right or left. He prefers the transactional to the ideological. And for conservatives devoted to a cause that is fundamentally about ideas, the distance between the new president and the movement he overtook continues to loom as a red flag. That gap has been partly obscured by his first moves as president  —   trying to bar visitors from seven largely Muslim countries, scaling back Wall Street regulations, restricting federal funding that could go to abortion overseas and nominating a judge to the Supreme Court who is adored by conservatives. But some in the movement are unlikely ever to be totally at ease. And Mr. Trump may never fully be at ease with many of them. “With Trump, I do feel his instincts are conservative I do feel he understands the practical implications of an incompetent and inefficient government,” said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which will convene CPAC starting on Wednesday. This time, Mr. Trump has been extended an invitation and is expected to speak. Still, with regard to conservatism, Mr. Schlapp added, “I’m not so sure he understands all the tenets and the philosophical background. ” Other Republican presidents have disappointed conservatives with major policy moves, from Dwight D. Eisenhower’s preservation of New Deal programs to Richard M. Nixon’s regulatory agenda to the elder George Bush’s reversal on his “no new taxes” pledge. But Mr. Trump, who considers himself the consummate deal maker, faces gnawing suspicions that he will find it easy to cut bargains that betray conservative principles. “I think it is safe to say that on the issues that are important to movement conservatives, the president’s actions since the inauguration have significantly reduced concerns by conservatives,” said Morton Blackwell, a longtime conservative activist who served as Ronald Reagan’s liaison to conservative activists and met with Mr. Trump at the White House this month. Still, Mr. Blackwell added, “there are significant numbers of people who are concerned. ” What makes some especially wary of Mr. Trump, said Grover Norquist, the veteran   activist and conservative leader, is how uninterested the president seems in their ideas. “They don’t think he’d ever read their novel, their policy paper, their magazine article  —   or even listen to them for more than five minutes,” he said. Republicans remain traumatized by presidents they believe governed too far to the left despite promises to do the opposite. “They’re used to sending senators, governors, congressmen into Washington and instead of seeing a sewer, they see a hot tub that they want to jump in,” Mr. Norquist said. Mr. Trump has, however, given conservatives plenty of reasons to temper their concerns. Beyond the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and the flurry of executive orders, he has assembled a cabinet that the American Conservative Union deemed the most conservative of any Republican president, based on ratings given to the appointees who were members of Congress. The group scores lawmakers on a    scale of conservatism. And the six House members and senators Mr. Trump has selected for his cabinet were among the most conservative on Capitol Hill, earning an average score of 90. 6. “I’m seeing a pattern,” Mr. Schlapp said, “where I can more comfortably say he’s governing like a conservative. ” But many of the biggest items on the conservative checklist remain in flux  —   the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act and an overhaul of the tax code being chief among them. And it remains in doubt whether Mr. Trump, whose White House has ricocheted from one distraction to the next in its first few weeks, will retain enough credibility with lawmakers to accomplish those goals. “I think now the question is: Can we get a lot of this stuff done?” said William Kristol, a frequent Trump critic and editor at large of The Weekly Standard. The risk for conservative policy, he said, is that the circuslike atmosphere around the White House will end up shattering Mr. Trump’s relationship with Republican lawmakers. “And if it really is a circus, you don’t want to be just another clown inside the tent,” Mr. Kristol added. One reason that some conservatives believe Mr. Trump’s support from the movement and its loyal lawmakers is so fragile is that it has been predicated on the sugar high of an election everyone told them they could not win against an opponent they loathed. “I think the majority of conservatives celebrating his victory were really celebrating Hillary’s defeat,” said Al Cardenas, a former chairman of the American Conservative Union. “And he was the conduit for that defeat. ” There are also serious policy questions that trouble conservatives, foremost among them what might happen to the federal deficit if Mr. Trump embarks on a plan to spend $1 trillion on revamping the nation’s infrastructure  —   a deal that many Democrats are eager to strike with him. That is where Mr. Trump’s brand of transactional politics could become a liability. “That was sort of the point of view of the tentative Trump supporters  —   you can do transactional politics with them,” said Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review. But the conservatives are hardly guaranteed to come out on the winning end of the transaction every time.",0

Sioux Falls, IA | During his 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton allegedly had sexual intercourse with cattle off of Tom Brady’s family dairy farm. 
The family farm which was owned by Tom Brady’s father at the time, Willow Brady Jr., was often visited by the Clinton family when they were in the area. 
“My dad and Bill Clinton’s step dad were like brothers. They often visited us on the holidays when I was a kid. Bill even knew the cows names by heart. That always surprised me” recalls the 64-year-old, third-generation dairy farmer. 
“ My father was a strong Democratic party supporter all his life and a big Bill Clinton fan, so I never found the strength to tell him the truth before he passed away ” 
Sex, drugs and cattle 
During the 1992 Iowa caucus, the Clinton campaign stopped by for a night of festivities at the Brady’s farm, a night Tom Brady says he will never forget. 
“The Clinton team came by and we drank a lot and all was merry before they started indulging in hard drugs, that’s when everything went wrong” he recalls, visibly distraught by the whole affair. 
“I don’t know about all those stories about him sexually assaulting women, but I sure as hell know he assaulted one of our cows because I was there and I saw him do it with my own eyes and believe me, it’s not something I’d wish my worst enemy to live to see” he told local reporters. 
“I’m sorry for the Clinton family, but as a God-fearing Christian, I just had to let the truth be known” he adds. 
Bill Clinton has been personally accused publicly by seventeen women of sexual misconduct between 1972 and 1997. The former US President also admitted to having had an “inappropriate relationship” with Monica Lewinsky while she worked at the White House in 1995 and 1996.",1

RIP - Leonard Cohen Dead at 82
Video
 "" Rolling Stone"" - Leonard Cohen, the hugely influential singer and songwriter whose work spanned nearly 50 years, died Monday at the age of 82. Cohen's label, Sony Music Canada, confirmed his death on the singer's Facebook page Thursday evening.
""It is with profound sorrow we report that legendary poet, songwriter and artist, Leonard Cohen has passed away,"" the statement read. ""We have lost one of music's most revered and prolific visionaries. A memorial will take place in Los Angeles at a later date. The family requests privacy during their time of grief."" A cause of death and exact date of death was not given.

 Leonard Cohen Everybody Know Live 1988
""My father passed away peacefully at his home in Los Angeles with the knowledge that he had completed what he felt was one of his greatest records,"" Cohen's son Adam wrote in a statement to Rolling Stone . ""He was writing up until his last moments with his unique brand of humor.""
""Unmatched in his creativity, insight and crippling candor, Leonard Cohen was a true visionary whose voice will be sorely missed,"" his manager Robert Kory wrote in a statement. ""I was blessed to call him a friend, and for me to serve that bold artistic spirit firsthand, was a privilege and great gift. He leaves behind a legacy of work that will bring insight, inspiration and healing for generations to come.""
Cohen was the dark eminence among a small pantheon of extremely influential singer-songwriters to emerge in the Sixties and early Seventies. Only Bob Dylan exerted a more profound influence upon his generation, and perhaps only Paul Simon and fellow Canadian Joni Mitchell equaled him as a song poet.
Cohen's haunting bass voice, nylon-stringed guitar patterns and Greek-chorus backing vocals shaped evocative songs that dealt with love and hate, sex and spirituality, war and peace, ecstasy and depression. He was also the rare artist of his generation to enjoy artistic success into his Eighties, releasing his final album, You Want It Darker , earlier this year.
""I never had the sense that there was an end,"" he said in 1992. ""That there was a retirement or that there was a jackpot.""
""For many of us, Leonard Cohen was the greatest songwriter of them all,"" Nick Cave, who covered Cohen classics like ""Avalanche,"" ""I'm Your Man"" and ""Suzanne,"" said in a statement. ""Utterly unique and impossible to imitate no matter how hard we tried. He will be deeply missed by so many.""
Leonard Norman Cohen was born on September 21st, 1934, in Westmount, Quebec. He learned guitar as a teenager and formed a folk group called the Buckskin Boys. Early exposure to Spanish writer Federico Garcia Lorca turned him toward poetry  while a flamenco guitar teacher convinced him to trade steel strings for nylon. After graduating from McGill University, Cohen moved to the Greek island of Hydra, where he purchased a house for $1,500 with the help of a modest trust fund established by his father, who died when Leonard was nine. While living on Hydra, Cohen published the poetry collection Flowers for Hitler (1964) and the novels The Favourite Game (1963) and Beautiful Losers (1966).
Frustrated by poor book sales, and tired of working in Montreal's garment industry, Cohen visited New York in 1966 to investigate the city's robust folk-rock scene. He met folk singer Judy Collins, who later that year included two of his songs, including the early hit ""Suzanne,"" on her album In My Life . His New York milieu included Andy Warhol, the Velvet Underground, and, most importantly, the haunting German singer Nico, whose despondent delivery he may have emulated on his exquisite 1967 album Songs of Leonard Cohen .
Cohen quickly became the songwriter's songwriter of choice for artists like Collins, James Taylor, Willie Nelson and many others. His black-and-white album photos offered an arresting image to go with his stark yet lovely songs. His next two albums, Songs From a Room (1969) and Songs of Love and Hate (1971), benefited from the spare production of Bob Johnston, along with a group of seasoned session musicians that included Charlie Daniels.
During the Seventies, Cohen set out on the first of the many long, intense tours he would reprise toward the end of his career. ""One of the reasons I'm on tour is to meet people,"" he told Rolling Stone in 1971. ""I consider it a reconnaissance. You know, I consider myself like in a military operation. I don't feel like a citizen."" His time on tour inspired the live sound producer John Lissauer brought to his 1974 masterpiece, New Skin for the Old Ceremony . However, he risked a production catastrophe by hiring wall-of-sound maximalist Phil Spector to work on his next album, Death of a Ladies Man , whose adversarial creation resulted in a Rolling Stone review titled ""Leonard Cohen's Doo-Wop Nightmare.""
Cohen's relationship with Suzanne Elrod during most of the Seventies resulted in two children, the photographer Lorca Cohen and Adam Cohen, who leads the group Low Millions. Cohen was well known for his wandering ways, and his most stable relationships were with backing singers Laura Branigan, Sharon Robinson, Anjani Thomas, and, most notably, Jennifer Warnes, who he wrote with and produced (Warnes frequently performed Cohens music). After indulging in a variety of international styles on Recent Songs (1979), Cohen accorded Warnes full co-vocal credit on 1984's Various Positions .
Various Positions included ""Hallelujah,"" a meditation on love, sex and music that would become Cohen's best-known composition thanks to Jeff Buckley's incandescent 1994 reinterpretation. Its greatness wasn't recognized by Cohen's label, however. By way of informing him that Columbia Records would not be releasing Various Positions , label head Walter Yetnikoff reportedly told Cohen, ""Look, Leonard; we know you're great, but we don't know if you're any good."" Cohen returned to the label in 1988 with I'm Your Man , an album of sly humor and social commentary that launched the synths-and-gravitas style he continued on The Future (1992).
In 1995, Cohen halted his career, entered the Mt. Baldy Zen Center outside of Los Angeles, became an ordained Buddhist monk and took on the Dharma name Jikan (""silence""). His duties included cooking for Kyozan Joshu Sasaki Roshi, the priest and longtime Cohen mentor who died in 2014 at the age of 104. Cohen broke his musical silence in 2001 with Ten New Songs , a collaboration with Sharon Robinson, and Dear Heather (2004), a relatively uplifting project with current girlfriend Anjani Thomas. While never abandoning Judaism, the Sabbath-observing songwriter attributed Buddhism to curbing the depressive episodes that had always plagued him.

The final act of Cohen's career began in 2005, when Lorca Cohen began to suspect her father's longtime manager, Kelley Lynch, of embezzling funds from his retirement account. In fact, Lynch had robbed Cohen of more than $5 million. To replenish the fund, Cohen undertook an epic world tour during which he would perform 387 shows from 2008 to 2013. He continued to record as well, releasing Old Ideas (2012) and Popular Problems , which hit U.S. shops a day after his eightieth birthday. ""[Y]ou depend on a certain resilience that is not yours to command, but which is present,"" he told Rolling Stone upon its release. ""And if you can sense this resilience or sense this capacity to continue, it means a lot more at this age than it did when I was 30, when I took it for granted.""
When the Grand Tour ended in December 2013, Cohen largely vanished from the public eye. In October 2016, he released You Want It Darker , produced by his son Adam. Severe back issues made it difficult for Cohen to leave his home, so Adam placed a microphone on his dining room table and recorded him on a laptop. The album was met with rave reviews, though a New Yorker article timed to its release revealed that he was in very poor health. ""I am ready to die,"" he said. ""I hope it's not too uncomfortable. That's about it for me.""
The singer-songwriter later clarified that he was ""exaggerating."" ""Ive always been into self-dramatization,"" Cohen said last month. ""I intend to live forever.

20053,20053,Harry Belafonte: ‘Movements Don’t Die’ - The New York Times,Tamara Best,"During his   career, Harry Belafonte has been a singer, an actor, a friend to Martin Luther King Jr. a Unicef   ambassador, an   activist and more. “I’m at a time of life when I’m examining the entire journey,” he said one recent afternoon at his Manhattan home, lamenting how the dreams of the civil rights movement are far from realized. “When I was 20 and 30, my visions for what the world would be, all things were possible. ” Mr. Belafonte, for whom art and activism have been inextricably linked, said his life is a “call and response,” and, at 89, he isn’t ready to retire from being one of society’s most passionate and visible advocates just yet. This weekend, “Many Rivers to Cross,” a   “music, art and justice” festival in the Atlanta area focuses on three issues: voting, mass incarceration, and the relationship between community and law enforcement. The lineup features an array of genres and musical styles: John Legend Carlos Santana Goapele Dave Matthews and Tip Harris, better known as the rapper T. I. are scheduled to take the stage, alongside Chris Rock, the poet Sonia Sanchez, the actor Jesse Williams and the activist Umi Selah of the Dream Defenders. The event will raise money for Sankofa. org, a social justice organization founded by Mr. Belafonte that unites   organizations and artists in the fight against problems like income disparity and inequities in the justice system. “What makes a movement work are thousands of parts that come together and express itself in favor of a given destination or objective,” he said. “You have to find men and women who are willing to play the role that each of these things demand. ” With Election Day nearing in what has been a contentious presidential race exposing deep ideological divides, registration services will be available to help attendees ahead of nationwide deadlines. “The vote is perhaps the single most important weapon in our arsenal,” Mr. Belafonte said. An area called the social justice village will feature representatives from over 40 organizations. The goal is to allow festivalgoers to “walk away with tools to better go out and support the causes they care about,” said Gina Belafonte, who helped organize the event with her father. Mr. Belafonte said, “When Trayvon Martin was shot and our community went into a response to that, there was no question in my mind that America was being awakened to its reality. ” Thinking back to the 1950s and ’60s, when he toiled alongside activists including Dr. King, Julian Bond and Fannie Lou Hamer, Mr. Belafonte recalled how Dr. King represented a “harvest of opportunity. ” He added: “The energy that went into the movement disappeared because people were reaping the benefits. We’ve forgotten what the opportunity was about. ” In 2012, a brouhaha ensued after Mr. Belafonte asserted that today’s celebrities have “turned their back on social responsibility” and mentioned Jay Z and Beyoncé. Jay Z responded in an interview with Rap Radar’s Elliott Wilson by saying among other things, “my presence is charity. ” Mr. Belafonte said that he extended an olive branch and that he and Jay Z met one on one. But Mr. Belafonte fervently maintains that artists must do more to champion causes. “There’s no evidence that artists are of the same passion and of the same kind of commitment of the artists of my time,” he said. “The absence of black artists is felt very strongly because the most visible oppression is in the black community. ” Mr. Belafonte provides counsel to celebrities and organizations, saying that he draws parallels between the roadblocks and successes of the ’50s and ’60s and those of the present political movements. Linda Sarsour, the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, said conversations with Mr. Belafonte had proved critical. “Mr. B plays no games with us,” she said. “When he doesn’t think we’re doing the right thing, he tells us. He said, ‘Look, you need the wisdom of your elders, but we need your energy right now. ’” T. I. who will perform at “Many Rivers to Cross” on Saturday, said he felt compelled to take action his latest EP, “Us or Else,” addresses interactions between law enforcement and blacks, among other issues, and part of its proceeds benefit Sankofa. org. “It just seemed all too consistent, all too repeated, all too ignored,” he said of police killings of black people. In the widely viewed video for the song “Warzone,” which he plans to perform at the festival, he spotlights the cases of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Philando Castile. “It was very insightful to hear from someone who had been through so much and been a part of history in so many ways,” he said of his meeting with Mr. Belafonte. With his 90th birthday on his mind, Mr. Belafonte paused to take stock. “I wake up at the age of 90, and I look around and say, ‘What do we need now? ’” he said. “Well, the same things needed now are the same things needed before,” he went on. “Movements don’t die because struggle doesn’t die. ”",0

20055,20055,Arizona: “Poster Child” for ObamaCare’s Failures,Michael Tennant,"Email 
“The Arizona market is the poster child for the problems the [ObamaCare] exchanges are experiencing nationally,” Milliman Inc. actuary Tom Snook told the Wall Street Journal . 
It would be difficult to argue with Snook’s contention. While individual-insurance premiums are rising by an average of 25 percent across the country next year, Arizona’s premiums are set to grow by double or triple that, with some locales experiencing rate hikes topping 100 percent. Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes, Arizonans have but one insurance carrier from whom to purchase coverage, and one county nearly ended up with no carriers at all. 
It wasn’t supposed to turn out like this. Arizona was originally the poster child for the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) success. The first year the ACA exchanges opened for business, the state had eight insurers offering a wide variety of plans at low prices, in part because of an expectation that the federal government would bail them out if they suffered losses. “A 2013 Society of Actuaries report suggested that the Arizona individual-insurance market could more than double, growing to 570,681 consumers, with more than 80% of them buying through the exchange,” wrote the Journal . “The health-care costs of the newer customer base would be around 22% higher than the old one, it suggested.” 
Instead, as has been the case throughout the nation, Americans made health-insurance decisions based on their own needs rather than following the best-laid plans of politicians and bureaucrats. Those with pre-existing conditions took advantage of the ACA’s mandates that insurers cover them at rates comparable to those of their healthy neighbors, while those neighbors balked at buying coverage that was more expensive and less generous than they desired. The result: Enrollment fell well below expectations, with only 203,000 people buying exchange plans this year, while the cost of covering those enrollees was vastly greater than expected — “around 250% higher on average than individual members before the health law,” Jeff Stelnik, senior vice president of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona, told the Journal . 
To make matters worse, the bailouts never came through. The federal risk-corridor program was supposed to transfer profits from successful insurers to unsuccessful ones, but so few insurers made money on the exchanges that the program could only cover 12.6 percent of losses. Congress refused to make up the difference from general revenues. 
In Arizona, as elsewhere, this could only have one outcome: fewer insurers and higher premiums. Although the number of insurers increased to 11 in 2015, it returned to eight last year. Insurers were forced to raise rates each year — Blue Cross Blue Shield hiked premiums by 35 percent in 2014 — but it still wasn’t enough to break even, let alone turn a profit. The state’s ObamaCare co-op went under in 2015, and major insurers began pulling out of the state en masse this year. UnitedHealth Group and Aetna left entirely. Blue Cross Blue Shield and Health Net both announced they would exit the exchanges in Maricopa County, home of Phoenix, and Pinal County. That, in turn, would have left Pinal County without a single exchange insurer; but “after state and federal regulators ‘expressed their concern for Pinal residents,’” Blue Cross decided to remain in Pinal County after all, Stelnik told the Journal . 
For 2017, every Arizona county will have only one insurer on its exchange, save for Pima County, home to Tucson, which will have two. However, according to the New York Times , only Health Net is offering a full range of plans in Pima County, while Blue Cross is solely selling catastrophic plans for people under 30. Considering that the ACA also allows people to remain on their parents’ insurance until age 26, it seems likely that few will take advantage of Blue Cross’s offer. 
“There are no choices, really, for anybody in Maricopa County,” Phoenix resident Ken Hoag told the Arizona Republic . “The lack of choice is like having empty shelves (and) no food in a third-world country. Do I live in Cuba?” 
Of course, with mounting losses and no competition, it’s hardly surprising that premiums for individual plans are skyrocketing. Blue Cross Blue Shield is raising its rates by an average of 51 percent, Health Net an average of 75 percent. In Phoenix, premiums are going up a whopping 145 percent. Republic columnist Laurie Roberts notes that a typical 27-year-old Arizonan “buying the second lowest ‘silver plan’ will see premiums soar by 116 percent. If that 27 year old makes $35,000 a year, he’ll pay nearly 10 percent of his gross income for insurance even with an Obamacare subsidy. If he makes over $47,000, he’ll pay a jaw dropping $422 a month for insurance, up from $196 this year.” 
That subsidy, as usual, is the ace ObamaCare supporters always have up their sleeve. The rate hikes, while huge, aren’t so bad because the subsidies will cover most of the extra cost, they argue. “That may be so,” Roberts observed, “but how sustainable is a system in which insurance premiums rise by 116 percent in a year? Or even 25 percent a year?” 
Besides, subsidies don’t cover all the added expense. Hoag’s wife had to buy a new plan for 2017 because her old one is being discontinued. While her new plan’s benefits are comparable to those of her old plan, she is going to be stuck for an extra $50 a month in premiums despite her subsidy. 
And what of Arizonans who earn too much money to qualify for subsidies? For them, the Times admits, “the price increases will be excruciating.” The paper cites one example: Leslie Rycroft of Scottsdale, who works in human resources, is paying $1,100 a month this year for a United Healthcare plan that has a $13,000 deductible for her family of four. Their income was a little too high to qualify for a subsidy, she said. When she looked at her options on HealthCare.gov last week, she said she was “absolutely horrified” to see only one insurer, Health Net, offering plans that started at $2,200 a month. “It’s beyond ridiculous,” she said. “All of a sudden you are paying $26,000 a year,” Ms. Rycroft said, “just for catastrophic health insurance.” 
Thus, the Grand Canyon State has the unfortunate distinction of serving as the latest example of the great chasm between progressives’ pipe dreams and reality. As always, though, ordinary Americans, not the politicians who created this monster, are the ones suffering as a result. Is it any wonder that over half of Americans tell pollsters they disapprove of ObamaCare, and the number who say it has hurt them continues to rise? 
The only wonder is that politicians, who normally live and die by opinion polls, haven’t done anything to address their concerns. Perhaps the upcoming elections will change that, but don’t hold your breath. Should you pass out and injure yourself, you might not be able to afford the medical bills with your ObamaCare-approved insurance — if you can even pay the premium.

20056,20056,Anti-Brexit Meddler Gina Miller Poses Outside the Houses of Parliament,dailouk,"Home | World | Anti-Brexit Meddler Gina Miller Poses Outside the Houses of Parliament Anti-Brexit Meddler Gina Miller Poses Outside the Houses of Parliament By Alphonse Mucus 08/11/2016 13:27:37 
LONDON – England – Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller has been revelling in her new found fame by posing outside the Houses of Parliament. 


“I used to be a model you know,” Miller says every two minutes. 
She seems to be enjoying the limelight and fame of being one of the foreign interests who was instrumental in attempting to block 52% of British voters who voted to leave the EU. 
Posing in defiance, Ms Miller, a native of Guyana, brings out her new hat, acquired at some posh shop no doubt, or a betting shop lavatory to be more precise. 
“Do you like my new hat?” she scowls, as the primping begins in earnest. 
The photographer adjusts his lens, then sniffs loudly. 
“S’cuse me Miss, but what’s that awful smell? It smells like a turd that has festered in satan’s butt hole for a thousand years.” 
“It’s my hat, or shall I say crown. I shall wear it wherever I go from now on, and anyone who looks at me will see my beautiful crown that I wear so proudly, and think of me.” 
At that moment, four dozen bluebottle flies plop themselves on Gina Miller’s crown and tuck down to some good nosh. 
In the background, the spire of Big Ben looms over the scene, and as the coughing photographer clicks away, a wry smile comes over Gina Miller, she is the Queen today, the Queen of No-Brexit, and she will cherish this moment of fame for the fifteen minutes it will afford her. 
Enjoy your crown Gina Miller, you will wear it for the rest of your pitiful life.",1
20057,20057,Burning Fall Leaves Is Extremely Toxic For The Body & Planet,Lance Schuttler,"Burning Fall Leaves Is Extremely Toxic For The Body & Planet Nov 8, 2016 0 0 
With it being the time of autumn here in the northern hemisphere, the leaves have begun to fall and the colors have begun to change. In what has been a common practice of raking leaves and burning the piles, information is spreading as to why that practice is actually very harmful for people and the planet. Burning leaves is harmful to the health of a person. 
According to Wisconsin’s Department of Natural Resources , burning leaves creates a large amount of dust, soot and other airborne particulates as a result of the often slow process that burning leaves takes. These toxic particles have the ability to reach deep into the lungs, which can cause long-term respiratory issues as well as short term issues to like coughing, wheezing and an accentuation of asthma issues. 
More specifically, burning leaves creates smoke which contains carbon monoxide. This is deadly as it binds with hemoglobin in the bloodstream, which then drastically reduces the amount of oxygen circulating through the body. A bit further down, we’ll look at supplements a person can take if they are exposed to leaf smoke. 
The smoke from leaves also contains benzo (a) pyrene , which is a known carcinogen as it binds to and mutates DNA and is thought to be a major factor in cancer from cigarette smoke. 
Additionally, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , the concentrations of pollutants coming from leaf smoke can be higher than all other forms of air pollution combined, including factories, vehicles, garden and lawn equipment. 
Instead of burning leaves, one can consider composting them or looking into whether your town or city offers pick-up services for the leaves. Ensure though that the leaves are not being burned at a larger collection site. Consider composting your fall leaves. 
Composting leaves creates a wonderful after-effect by helping to create nutrient rich soil that can be used for potting plants or growing a garden. Ensuring that the leaves are shredded will help to speed up the decomposition process as well as including a source of nitrogen, which could be freshly cut green grass, animal manure or a product from your local home and garden store that helps to catalyze the process. One such product would be beneficial microbes . Supplements 
If you are exposed to leaf smoke, the first and most obviously thing a person can do is to get as far away as possible from the smoke. The second would be to get to a place where the air is clean and begin doing deep in and out breaths to replenish your body with oxygen. 
If a person was exposed for a lengthy period of time to the smoke, eating plenty of green vegetables and salads greens is a great way to not only detoxify the body of harmful pollutants, but also to give your body plenty of chlorophyll, which will help to carry oxygen throughout your bloodstream and into your cells. 
Supplements one can consider include chlorella and spirulina, which are both an algae that contains almost all known nutrients needed in the human body as well as a rich supply of chlorophyll. 
A person can also look into fulvic acid , which is the most potent anti-oxidant known and is excellent at removing toxins and metabolic waste from the body.

20058,20058,Fitton: Veteran Prosecuted for Posting American Flag on Veterans Affairs Center Fence on Memorial Day - Breitbart,Tom Fitton,"The treatment of veterans in Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals is an inexplicable scandal. Now try to focus on this: the federal government, in all its might, is bringing criminal charges against a    veteran for hanging an American flag on a fence. A     flag! On a Veterans Affairs fence! On Memorial Day! [We announced last week that we will provide legal representation to Robert L. Rosebrock, a   veteran who faces federal criminal charges for displaying two     American flags outside a Veterans Affairs fence on Memorial Day, May 30, 2016. The trial is scheduled to begin on March 7, 2017, in Los Angeles.  Rosebrock also is being criminally prosecuted for taking photographs on Memorial Day 2016, and on Sunday, June 12, 2016, without permission. The Memorial Day charge stems from photographs Rosebrock took of a Veterans Affairs police officer while the officer detained and cited him for displaying the two small flags outside the fence. Rosebrock also took photos of VA police detaining and handcuffing conservative activist Ted Hayes after Hayes displayed an American Flag above the same VA fence. Hayes, dressed as “Uncle Sam,” was not charged with any wrongdoing despite being detained and handcuffed. Uncle Sam! The case, United States of America v. Robert L. Rosebrock, (CC11, 4920201 4920202 6593951) will be heard by U. S. Magistrate Judge Steve Kim in the U. S. District Court for the Central District of California. Judicial Watch attorney Sterling E. Norris, a former Los Angeles County deputy district attorney and Los   defense attorney Robert Patrick Sticht will represent Rosebrock. The fence is part of the “Great Lawn Gate” entrance to the Los Angeles National Veterans Park, a public park on the corner of Wilshire and San Vincente Boulevards in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles. The gate and park are part of a larger,   parcel that includes the Veterans Home of West Los Angeles. Rosebrock, along with fellow veterans, Hayes and others, have been assembling at the site nearly every Sunday and Memorial Day since March 9, 2008, to protest what they believe is the VA’s failure to make full use of the valuable West Los Angeles property for the benefit and care of veterans, particularly homeless veterans. Deeded to the federal government in 1888 for the specific purpose of caring for disabled veterans, the property includes the veterans’ home, but also entirely unrelated uses such as a stadium for UCLA’s baseball team, an athletic complex for a nearby private prep school, a golf course, laundry facilities for a nearby Marriott hotel, storage and maintenance facilities for 20th Century Fox Television’s production sets, the Brentwood Theatre, soccer practice and match fields for a private girls’ soccer club, dog park, and a farmer’s market. A hotel laundry! VA officials previously told Rosebrock that a federal regulation allowed hanging the American Flag and   flags on the “Great Lawn Gate” fence, and Rosebrock, Hayes and others hung as many as 30   America flags at the fence at the same time without incident. Rosebrock faces up to six months’ imprisonment if found guilty on any of the three charges. Six months! The federal government’s pursuit of these vindictive charges against Mr. Rosebrock is  . Why in the world would the feds prosecute a    veteran over the placement of two small American flags at the entrance to a park honoring veterans on Memorial Day? Frankly, President Trump should ask why the VA and his Justice Department are trying to jail this American patriot.",0
20059,20059,"SHOCK STATEMENT: Anthony Weiner SPEAKS, Drops LEGAL NUKE On Hillary",DSG,"Did Anthony Weiner say these things as part a deal to save himself? Anthony Weiner has spoken! One year ago, we all that that Donald Trump was just being funny, just being Trump, when he said that Hillary Clinton was showing poor judgement in letting Huma Abedin, wife of “perf sleaze” Anthony Weiner have access to government information. Trump called the couple a security risk, but again, we thought he was just making fun of them. As it turns out, Donald Trump’s words were eerily prophetic. Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you have heard by now that the FBI is reopening the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email problems after finding evidence on devices at Anthony Weiner’s home. Earlier, we reported that FBI Director James Comey had tricked Obama’s Department of Justice and the Clintons in sending the investigation announcement letter to Congress. Some believe that Comey was attempting to force the DOJ to issue a warrant so that his agents can start reading the 10,000+ emails on Weiner’s device. 
Here Is How FBI Director Comey BAMBOOZLED The DOJ, CONGRESS, And The CLINTONS All At Once 
Now, Anthony Weiner has spoken and he may have made Comey’s job even easier, while completely bypassing the Department of Justice altogether. 
According to reports, Weiner has given permission for the FBI to access all of the information on his electronic devices, including his wifi router. . @BretBaier emails Chris Wallace while he’s on air: Weiner has given FBI permission to search computer so no warrant needed. @FoxNewsSunday 
— Josh Rogin (@joshrogin) October 30, 2016 I emailed that 2 sources say Weiner is cooperating w/ FBI- & co-owned laptop. Also NY FBI had info 4 a few weeks- pressure was building https://t.co/AHbQVtvQzg 
— Bret Baier (@BretBaier) October 30, 2016 
In essence, Weiner is singing like a bird, and the FBI can conduct a thorough review of the emails in question. If there is criminality found on Weiner’s devices, they have a shot at it. 
Is there anything that the Department of Justice or the Clintons can do? 
Time will tell, but many believe that WikiLeaks and others are about to drop more incriminating evidence on Hillary later this week. 
Comey may have saved himself. Weiner may be trying to cut a plea deal to save himself.

20060,20060,Airbag Propellant Bound for Takata Factory Detonates en Route - The New York Times,Hiroko Tabuchi,"A woman was killed in her home and four other people were injured when a truck carrying Takata airbag parts and explosives crashed and detonated on a Texas road last week, the company and local authorities confirmed on Monday. The immense blast  —   the victim’s remains were not located for two days  —   highlighted the potency of the explosives used by Takata in its airbags as a propellent to activate its bags in a car crash. It also pointed to the risks associated with Takata’s transport of the explosives across the country from a propellant factory in Washington State to Mexico. Takata’s airbags, and the explosive material used to make them, are at the center of the largest auto safety recall in history. Takata airbags installed in automobiles can explode violently when activated, and have been linked to the deaths of at least 14 drivers as well as to the injuries of over 100 people. Fourteen automakers have recalled more than 64 million inflaters over the defect. The airbags use a propellant based on ammonium nitrate, which has come under scrutiny for its tendency to break down over time and combust violently when triggered. In last week’s accident, which occurred in the early hours of Aug. 22, the woman who died, Lucila Robles, 69, was apparently in her home in the town of Quemado, on the Mexico border, when the crash occurred on the road in front of her property before dawn. The blast destroyed the home. The sheriff’s office sent out search parties for Ms. Robles, thinking she may have been carried by the force of the explosion into nearby brush. Investigators called off the search after two days when they discovered Ms. Robles’s bones, teeth and other remains in the smoldering debris of her house, said Tom Schmerber, the local sheriff for the county of Maverick. Also injured were the two drivers of the truck, who fled their vehicle after it swerved off the road and crashed, and two   in a car. An internal document provided by a former Takata employee shows that Takata transports its explosive compound more than 2, 000 miles across the United States, from its   plant in Moses Lake, Wash. to a distribution center just north of the Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Tex. The   journey, manned by two drivers, takes the truck through Boise, Idaho, and Salt Lake City, as well as Albuquerque and Santa Fe, N. M. according to the document, dated October 2007. From Eagle Pass, the propellant is transferred to separate trucks that then travel to Takata’s airbag factory in Monclova, Mexico, according to the document. Drivers of the trucks are required to be equipped with   clothing,   boots with rubber soles, safety goggles and helmets, the document says, pointing to the hazardous nature of the cargo. Takata said the trucks were carrying the propellant alongside airbag components called inflaters, which are small devices within an airbag that contain the explosive material and which are designed to cause an airbag to inflate in microseconds. The inflaters aboard the truck were newly manufactured, the company said. In a statement, a spokesman for Takata, Jared Levy, said the company followed all regulatory requirements. Glenn P. Wicks, managing director at the Wicks Group, a law firm based in the District of Columbia that specializes in hazmat transportation, said it was not immediately clear whether any federal safety regulations were violated in Takata’s shipping of the propellant and inflaters. Given the severity of the crash, he said, the ammonium nitrate propellant could have triggered an explosion by itself, with or without the inflaters present. Still, investigators are likely to scrutinize how the propellant was packaged and shipped, whether the drivers were certified to handle hazardous materials and whether their working hours were within legal limits, Mr. Wicks said. The Department of Transportation said its investigators were working closely with local officials in Texas to look into the crash and explosion. “Every possible factor or factors  —   including the safety compliance of the motor carrier, the handling of the cargo by the shipper, its packaging, how the truck was placarded, as well as the truck’s routing  —   and all other aspects will be thoroughly investigated to determine whether there were violations of any U. S. Department of Transportation safety regulations, which exist to protect everyone’s safety,” the agency said. The explosion is not Takata’s first accident involving ammonium nitrate. In March 2006, its Monclova plant was severely damaged by a series of blasts blamed on the ammonium nitrate propellant. There were no injuries, although the explosions blew out the windows of nearby homes and forced hundreds of workers and local residents to evacuate. Takata said the truck was operated by a subcontractor, which it did not name. The supplier immediately sent personnel to the site and has been cooperating with local investigators, Mr. Levy said in a statement. “Takata has strict safety procedures relating to the transportation of its products that meet or exceed all regulatory requirements,” he said. “Our thoughts are with the family of the woman who died as a result of this accident, and with the four people injured. ”",0
20061,20061,Want Co-Workers to Vote Your Way? Then Stop Pestering Them - The New York Times,Gavan Fitzsimons,"Every four years, I notice a dramatic increase in personal disclosure at the office.   who are usually reserved about nonwork matters suddenly begin expressing their political beliefs and singing the praises of their preferred presidential candidates. I understand the desire to discuss such a critical event, even if there is a risk of stirring up rancor among people with opposing views. For people whose political opinions are aligned, such conversations can be satisfying and reinforce collegial bonds. Some people feel the election is so important that they simply must express their views in the office. But those who do should beware: Political talk at work can have unintended effects. Declaring your support for a candidate is essentially an unsolicited recommendation to any people who can hear you, whether they are listening voluntarily or not. Research I have done shows that people often have peculiar reactions to such talk. Rather than doing what’s recommended, or even ignoring a suggestion, they often do the exact opposite of what you propose. For example, Donald R. Lehmann of Columbia University and I told participants in a study that a health and fitness magazine strongly recommended against a particular granola bar. Armed with this advice, the participants’ preference for that granola bar then skyrocketed. We got the same results when we told another group of participants about an auto magazine’s compact car recommendations. That people will resist expert recommendations about a car purchase suggests this tendency also plays into decisions with higher stakes  —   including, perhaps, an election. Studies of backlash to restrictions have shown that even strongly held beliefs and behaviors can be turned on their heads. For example, some hospital patients react to restrictions of their freedom by placing themselves at a much greater health risk. Obviously, for a large portion of the public, voting preferences are not subject to outside influence. Some people, for example, always vote the party line no matter what. But for voters who are undecided, subtle environmental influences have the potential to play an outsize role at the polls. When people ask for your opinion before making a choice, they typically incorporate it into their decision. Sometimes they value it greatly. But if you offer advice without being asked  —   watch out. This backlash to unsolicited advice comes from a psychological concept known as reactance, first identified in the 1960s by Jack W. Brehm, a social psychologist at Duke. When a freedom to choose is restricted, it becomes much more attractive. Tell a    child he can have either the   or   candy but not the orange, and orange is suddenly his new favorite flavor. People do not appear to outgrow this tendency as they mature. Unlike tuning into a pundit’s TV show, or reading the editorial page of a newspaper, people rarely seek out their colleagues for political recommendations. Making a show of supporting one candidate, or criticizing another, is a form of unsolicited opinion. Based on our research, I’d say it’s most likely to be resisted, maybe even to the point where an undecided voter will lean the other way. Many workplaces request that their employees not discuss politics in the office. Such policies are generally thought to reduce animosity among   who have differing perspectives. Unfortunately, such policies are rarely successful, and in many cases they elevate political discussion to forbidden fruit. As we learned from our study of reactance, a restricted freedom becomes a desirable one. So employees    thrust their opinions on their colleagues, perhaps talking about a funny portrayal of a disliked candidate on a television program instead of directly attacking the person. And this, of course, creates the potential for a backlash against that political perspective. The colleagues rejecting your unsolicited political advice might not even realize that they are doing so. In work with Tanya L. Chartrand and Amy N. Dalton at Duke, I found that many people push back against perceived threats to their freedom outside their conscious awareness. In one study, we asked participants to name someone in their lives who wanted them to work hard. Then we asked them to work on a puzzle. The participants actually did a worse job when the name of the person who wanted them to work hard was flashed subliminally on a screen before they began working on the puzzle. When it comes to political preferences, keep in mind that certain combinations of perceptions can magnify the effect of a backlash. If you pull into the company lot driving a Toyota Prius  —   already associated with liberal voters  —   plastered with a Hillary   Kaine bumper sticker, and then loudly complain about Donald J. Trump while getting your morning coffee, it could be seen as a particularly annoying,   recommendation. The net effect of who you are, and what you say, could turn undecided voters away from the Democratic ticket. We might expect a similar backlash to a gun enthusiast loudly supporting Mr. Trump. However, these assumptions could also be turned to a candidate’s advantage. If you are a   hybrid driver, or if you like to hunt and you’re a big fan of Mrs. Clinton, then go ahead and tell everyone at the office, and slap an   bumper sticker on your hybrid or your truck. By defying expectations you’ll most likely dampen the automatic backlash, and you might even encourage undecided voters to think twice about your candidate. Perhaps they will realize there’s something they missed.",0
20062,20062,"Liberal Activists Demand Russia Investigation, Trump Impeachment at ’March for Truth’ - Breitbart",Alex Clark,"Hundreds of    activists gathered at the base of the Washington Monument this morning to advocate for an independent investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election.[  Above:   protesters gather in the “March for Truth” at the base of the Washington Monument June 3, 2017, Anger and derision were also directed at the president for his perceived mishandling of the truth, his associates’ interactions with various Russian officials, and American withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement.  Speakers at the event included Congressman Jamie Raskin, NOW President Terry O’Neill, Obama Speechwriter Jon Lovett, Town Hall Project Spokesman Jimmy Dahman, and   Activist Linda Sarsour.  Congressman Raskin spoke of Russian President Vladimir Putin leading a global conspiracy to destroy liberal democracy with his own puppets, ranging from President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines to President Trump. He also railed against the American President’s entire agenda as “an act of war” on the American people.  Above: Congressman Raskin of Maryland Speaking at the March for Truth  All the speakers received thunderous applause interspersed with chants of “lock him up” and “Resist. ” Speakers also alleged that Russian interference helped Donald Trump win the presidential election through fake news campaigns, paid Russian trolls on social media, and   media outlets.  Various protest signs featured President Trump and President Putin in cahoots and essentially as one in the same person. Hammer and Sickle imagery was constantly evoked, bringing back memories of the Cold War. This Russophobia was especially striking, given that leaders in the Democrat Party snarked at Mitt Romney for calling Russia “America’s greatest geopolitical foe” in 2012.  The crowd was largely white, which is noteworthy because leftists famously derided Tea Party gatherings and Trump campaign rallies for being overwhelmingly Caucasian. Various attendees refused to speak with this reporter due to his affiliation with Breitbart News. However, some were generous to share their thoughts on the event.  Helen, a political science student from Loudon County said, “We need more transparency, and an independent investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. ” While she would prefer not to reach out to President Trump himself, she expressed a desire to reach Trump supporters and explain to them why an investigation would be warranted.  Mary and James, a mother and son who drove down from Maine, claimed that President Trump’s involvement with Russia originated from Trump taking out loans from Russian financial institutions in the wake of the 2008 recession. James especially expressed frustration over Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s inability to answer basic questions from the press regarding such Russian ties.  Not everyone at the rally was in line with such sentiments. One young man who went by the namesake of the second President, John Adams, held up a sign reading “CNN=ISIS” to derision and boos from the crowd. The efforts of Adams and his friends,   info warriors and trolls, likely stemmed from Alex Jones’s promises of cash rewards to those holding up CNN=ISIS signs on TV.  Adams blasted the Russian collusion narrative as fake. He claimed such contacts with Russian officials were legitimate, citing Jeff Sessions meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kilsylak as a normal duty of an American senator. Others who refused to speak with the media included noted and controversial Muslim activist Linda Sarsour, who brushed off this reporter’s questions in the aftermath of the rally.

The book celebrates a young boy who wears dresses to school, and it stigmatizes boys who urge their peers to wear boys’ clothes. After lawmakers in Raleigh heard the concerns, the book was removed from the “ ” curriculum  —   but it was replaced with Red: A Crayon’s Story, which focuses on a red crayon that believes itself to be blue, reports WFXB.   But both books are included in the campaign known as Welcoming Schools by the LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign, an effort to help elementary schools become “ ” and “ . ” According to the Amazon review, the Red: A Crayon’s Story book “can be read at any levels. ” The review says: Red has a bright red label, but he is, in fact, blue. His teacher tries to help him be red (let’s draw strawberries!) his mother tries to help him be red by sending him out on a playdate with a yellow classmate (go draw a nice orange!) and the scissors try to help him be red by snipping his label so that he has room to breathe.

Also, Amazon shows the two books are often bought by the same buyers and are matched with sales of a book about a boy who wants to be a girl named “Jazz. ” Other books, including “Toni the Tampon,” push the same transgender claim that a person’s sex is changeable, regardless of biology.  “The purpose of our elementary schools is to teach writing, reading, and arithmetic, not to encourage boys to wear dresses,” Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of NC Values Coalition, said in a statement. “I read the book online,” she told the New York Times. “It’s clearly geared to young children. The book is meant as a tool of indoctrination to normalize transgender behavior. I think a lot of parents would object to that. ” Schools should be focused on helping young children to achieve the building blocks of learning, not indoctrinating them in progressive social values, she said in her statement: CMS is failing our children in the recent 2016 state academic ratings, 43 of 165 CMS schools achieved overall pass rates below 50% and a majority (59%) earned a grade of C or below when measuring student proficiency and growth. These lessons found in the book, Jacob’s New Dress and My Princess Boy and other transgender curriculum are not appropriate for any child whose parents support traditional family values. There is no question that this attempt by CMS staff to mandated training is nothing more than putting a dress on CMS’s Gender Unicorn. We encourage CMS to refocus on their mission of maximizing academic achievement instead of advancing this controversial curriculum. The    “Gender Unicorn” message tells children that sexual attitudes can be chosen, diverse and fluid, despite the risk of derailing some children’s normal maturation into healthy and stable young men and young women.  The CMS school board is currently preparing to add sexual orientation and “gender  ” to its policy on multiculturalism, reports the Charlotte Observer, along with such things as race, religion and national origin. “The proposed new policy  …    calls for CMS to “intentionally incorporate diversity throughout the curriculum, instruction and professional development,” says the report. Fitzgerald continued: As Charlotte’s City Council passed an outrageous ordinance last year that made it necessary for the State to correct the mistake with HB2,   schools was working on rolling out a new   policy that seeks to indoctrinate students in the school district by normalizing transgender behavior. Both Charlotte’s ordinance and the CMS transgender indoctrination were advanced by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT activist group, in conjunction with its NC affiliates, Equality NC and Time Out Youth. They provided the curriculum, the training, and the lesson plans for mandated transgender training for our children, complete with the Gender Unicorn, all while the Bank of America funded the program and the groups that support it. Last year, the Charlotte City Council passed the ordinance that allowed anyone who simply declared they had changed their gender to use the restrooms and locker rooms of the opposite sex. The ordinance was pushed forward by registered sex offender Chad   and national   groups during the tenure of Mayor Jennifer Roberts. Former Gov. Pat McCrory (R) however, signed the HB2 privacy and public safety bill into law to nullify the Charlotte ordinance. HB2 required people to use the bathroom that matched the official documentation of their sex. The documents could be their original birth certificate, or a modified birth certificate after surgical changes, so allowing people who want to live as members of other sex to use bathrooms reserved for the other sex. Following the passage of HB2, progressive groups pushed major universities, sports organizations, businesses, and celebrities to boycott the state. The resulting boycotts helped the state’s establishment media to portray the   law as an economic hazard. In general, gay groups opposed the HB2 law because they seek to blur the social and legal recognition of the two male and female sexes. In general, transgender and gay groups opposed the HB2 law because they want to blur the social and legal recognition of the two male and female sexes. The overall goal is to get government support for the “transgender ideology,” which says that Americans should sacrifice their   institutions  —   such as bathrooms, sports leagues, women’s shelters, and normal   practices   —   to validate the relatively few people who want to live as members of the other sex.   groups and their progressive political allies are trying to shape the early development of children, but are being rejected by the public and resisted by mainstream professional and   groups.

20065,20065,Obama Says He Would Have Defeated Trump for a Third Term - The New York Times,Michael S. Schmidt,"HONOLULU  —   President Obama expressed confidence that, if he had run for a third term, he would have defeated Donald J. Trump, according to an interview released Monday with David Axelrod, his friend and former adviser. “I’m confident that if I  —   if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could’ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,” Mr. Obama said on Mr. Axelrod’s podcast, “The Axe Files,” referring to his message of inclusion and helping   Americans. “I know that in conversations that I’ve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one,” he said. Several hours after the interview was posted, Mr. Trump responded on Twitter. “President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me,” Mr. Trump said. “He should say that but I say NO WAY!  —   jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc. ” The discussion in the interview was pure political conjecture, because the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution limits a president to two terms. Mr. Obama praised the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, saying that she performed well under difficult circumstances and that there “was a double standard with her. ” “For whatever reason, there’s been a longstanding difficulty in her relationship with the press that meant her flaws were wildly amplified,” he said. But Mr. Obama also said she campaigned too cautiously. “If you think you’re winning, then you have a tendency, just like in sports, maybe to play it safer,” Mr. Obama said. He added: “And the economy has been improving. There is a sense, obviously, that some communities have been left behind from the recovery and people feeling anxious about that. ” It was “nonsense,” Mr. Obama said, that Democrats had abandoned white   Americans, who rallied to Mr. Trump. “Look, the Affordable Care Act benefits a huge number of Trump voters,” Mr. Obama said. “There are a lot of folks in places like West Virginia or Kentucky who didn’t vote for Hillary, didn’t vote for me, but are being helped by this. ” The problem, Mr. Obama said, was that Democratic politicians were not communicating to these people “that we understand why they’re frustrated. ” “We’re not there on the ground communicating not only the dry policy aspects of this, but that we care about these communities, that we’re bleeding for these communities,” Mr. Obama said. “There’s an emotional connection, and part of what we have to do to rebuild is to be there,” he said. “And that means organizing, that means caring about state parties, it means caring about local races, state boards or school boards and city councils and state legislative races, and not thinking that somehow, just a great set of progressive policies that we present to the New York Times editorial board will win the day. ” In a telephone interview on Monday, Mr. Axelrod, now a commentator on CNN, said it was his sense that Mr. Obama was “frustrated” that his presidency is ending when his party has sustained such a dramatic loss. “He believes the momentum is still on his side in the long term,” Mr. Axelrod said. “He’s always been a guy who thinks long term and has an amazing ability to do that. ”",0

20068,20068,Four Simple Reasons Why the Global Elite Hate Russia,wmw_admin,"By wmw_admin on October 31, 2016 Zero Hedge — via Russia Insider Oct 28, 2016 
In our previous article The Secret Truth about Russia Exposed, we elaborated on how Russia is a convenient enemy for politicians and specifically the Democratic party, to create an enemy that really , well – doesn’t exist to distract and confuse voters. But like with any ‘enemy’ if you bomb a village, you may have some pissed off villagers. As we explain in our best selling book Splitting Pennies – the world doesn’t work the way you see on TV – in fact, it works more closely as seen on Zero Hedge. 
Although Russia simply is just a country in the wrong place at the wrong time (which, throughout Russian history, seems to be a theme for them) – there really is a reason the Elite hate Russia. It’s not because they’re Xenophobic, although there’s that too – it’s because of several key factors that make Russia a unique power in the world, compared to similar countries. Russia is an independent country. It’s not possible to manipulate Russia via external remote control, like it is most countries. The Elite don’t like that! Russia kicked out Soros “Open Society” : 
Russia has banned a pro-democracy charity founded by hedge fund billionaire George Soros, saying the organization posed a threat to both state security and the Russian constitution. In a statement released Monday morning, Russia’s General Prosecutor’s Office said two branches of Soros’ charity network — the Open Society Foundations (OSF) and the Open Society Institute (OSI) — would be placed on a “stop list” of foreign non-governmental organizations whose activities have been deemed “undesirable” by the Russian state. Russia is not easy to cripple via clandestine means, whether it be CIA, MI6, or outright military conflict. Some other BRICs however, that’s not the case. Say what you will about Russia’s military – it’s on par and in many cases, advanced, compared to the US military. And that’s not AN opinion, that’s in the opinion of top US military commanders: 
Late in September, we brought you “ US Readies Battle Plans For Baltic War With Russia ” in which we described a series of thought experiments undertaken by The Pentagon in an effort to determine what the likely outcome would be should something go horribly “wrong” on the way to landing the US in a shooting war with Russia in the Balkans. 
The results of those thought experiments were not encouraging. As a reminder, here’s how Foreign Policy summed up the exercises: Russian culture, and language, is too complex for the average “Elite” who pretends to be internationally well versed because they had a few semesters of French. For example, when the diplomat Clinton was Secretary of State, she presented a reset button translating the opposite meaning… ooops . 
“I would like to present you with a little gift that represents what President Obama and Vice President Biden and I have been saying and that is: ‘We want to reset our relationship, and so we will do it together.’… 
“We worked hard to get the right Russian word. Do you think we got it?” she asked Lavrov, laughing. “You got it wrong,” said Lavrov, as both diplomats laughed. 
“It should be “perezagruzka” [the Russian word for reset],” said Lavrov.”This says ‘peregruzka,’ which means ‘overcharged.’” 
Yes, it’s almost a certainty that if Clinton by some horrible fate is President there will be Nuclear war. Wars have been started over much more subtle mistakes. One would think, that Clinton would have had an advisor CHECK THIS before presenting it in a public ceremony, in front of reporters? How much more blatantly unprofessional can one be? If politicians worked in the private sector, they wouldn’t last a day! How do these people advance so far in politics? Plain and simple, the Elite do not control Russia. While there are backchannels of Russian oligarchs that work directly with Western Rothschild interests, for example, they simply don’t have the same level of control as they do European countries, like Germany for instance. Or another good example is China, there’s this fanatical talk that China can dump US Treasuries blah blah blah the fact is that China is completely dependent on USA and US Dollars, and will be for the rest of our lives. Maybe in 1000 years in the Dong Dynasty still to come they will rule the world but it’s not going to happen anytime soon. 
Russia is one of the most highly misunderstood cultures in the West. Which is strange, because Russia is more like America than any European country: Both Russia and America share huge landmasses with large undeveloped territory Both Russia and America are predominantly white christian majorities (although in last decades, America tries to be more of a melting pot whereas Russia favors ethnic cleansing) Both Russia and America fought against Hitler and the Nazis during World War 2, the defining event of the last 60 years 
There have been numerous interesting situations where Russia helped America and America helped Russia on a number of levels, to learn more about it checkout the following books: 
Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution . Armand Hammer: The Untold Story 
Most interestingly, during the Nixon administration Kissinger was prodding Nixon to partner with Russia that would, in Kissinger’s view would create an unstoppable alliance, that no one could compete with such a superpower axis. But, it didn’t happen, as there were ‘neo-cons’ who were against it, mostly Polish Catholics who have some deep genetic fear of any culture using the Cyrillic alphabet. 
Nixon instead chose China (what a mistake!) and created Forex. But the point being that, through a small slip of fate, “China” may have been in this alternative Kissinger reality the ‘Great Evil Enemy’ hacking our elections, as we drive across the Alaskan-Siberian highway without any speed limit, oil would be ten cents a gallon, and we wouldn’t need to war with the Middle East.",1
20069,20069,"Friday Mailbag: Mar-a-Lago, Assassins, Migrants and Drugs - The New York Times",Liz Spayd with Evan Gershkovich,"This week, when The Times ran a photograph depicting an assassin standing next to the body of his victim, the Russian ambassador to Turkey, readers wrote to the public editor with questions. Some wanted to protest the photo’s publication, some simply were curious about the thinking behind the decision to run it so prominently. We took these concerns to The Times’s standards editor, Phil Corbett, and because the comments section on the resulting interview was particularly lively, we decided to highlight some of the conversation here. Many commenters stood behind The Times’s decision. Others worried that the photo’s prominence lionized the killer and would inspire similar acts. Still other commenters wondered whether the dead ambassador ought to have been included in the photo. An astute commenter immediately answered the question: The commenter also included a link to a blog post by the public editor’s predecessor on the subject, which addressed that choice, and stood by the editors’ decision. In other news, Donald Trump held an    holiday party for the press at    on Sunday, and a Times journalist was in attendance. Readers wrote in to object to The Times’s presence at the meeting. Elisabeth Bumiller, the Washington bureau chief, discussed The Times’s attendance at the gala with Erik Wemple of The Washington Post earlier this week. “Our policy on    with presidents and   is to push long and hard to do things on record,” she said. “With journalists, you need some insight into the  ’s thinking. We have found in the past that this has helped us with Obama,” and she said    sessions gave The Times “thought and direction to pursue stories afterward. ” The public editor’s take: This is a case where I believe The Times was right in agreeing to the meeting. Such    sessions with the president are somewhat infrequent but common through the history of White House reporting. They offer a chance for the media to get to know the president they cover a little better, without sacrificing that much. After all, it isn’t that often that some information of great public import is revealed at these sessions. That said, pressing for    sessions is always the preferred route. After the terrorist attack on a Christmas market in Berlin on Monday, a reader wrote in concerned about The Times’s use of the word “migrant” rather than “refugee. ” We asked Corbett whether there have been internal discussions around these terms. “The International desk has indeed wrestled with this question, which is complicated and sensitive,” he said. “Migrants is the broader term, including both refugees and others. ” Joe Kahn, the current managing editor and former international editor, also addressed this question in a blog post the public editor’s predecessor wrote last year. “While imperfect, it is accurate to refer to both migrants and refugees as ‘migrants,’ because they all belong to the class of people moving from one place to another,” he said. “It is not accurate to refer to all migrants as refugees, however, as refugees have a special status under international law that does not apply to all migrants. ” Another reader noticed an issue with a story about a nightclub in T, The New York Times Style Magazine. The reader, Danny Cohen of Los Angeles, put it bluntly: “How could you not mention the problems with Tenants of the Trees?” He linked to a story that reported that multiple men and women claim to have been drugged at the nightclub earlier this year. The public editor’s take: I’m with the reader on this one. Seems like a shadow hanging over the place that the readers should have been told about. Happy holidays to our loyal readers. The public editor’s office will be shuttered next week as we take a quick breather. See you in the new year.",0
20070,20070,Hillary Clinton’s Exploits in McCarthyism,Consortiumnews.com,"Hillary Clinton’s Exploits in McCarthyism November 8, 2016 
The New Cold Warriors who surround Hillary Clinton have made Russia-bashing and McCarthyism the go-to tactics to silence the few voices warning of the grave and unnecessary risks of a new Cold War, notes James W Carden. 
By James W Carden 
Now that the 2016 election campaign is at long last over, an examination of the reckless, fact-free, innuendo-laden McCarthyite rhetoric which Hillary Clinton’s campaign surrogates deployed over the past several months is in order. 
The first and most obvious point to be made is that the anti-Russia hysteria that characterized the election, particularly in its final weeks, did not come out of nowhere; in fact, it should be seen as part of a natural progression of the elite media’s Russophobia which took root in and around the Ukraine crisis of late 2013-early 2014 and led, almost ineffably, not only to charges of Russian election-rigging in the United States but in the identification, in the pages of Newsweek and the Washington Post , of Russian fifth-columns within the United States. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. 
How the Ukraine crisis poisoned America political discourse is by now well known. As I reported in The Nation almost 18 months ago, the cottage industry of unscrupulous neo-McCarthyites which has grown up around Washington, London and Manhattan in recent years has sought to stifle debate by bandying charges of unpatriotic disloyalty against anyone questioning the wisdom of U.S. policy toward Russia. (It bears noting that something similar regarding Syria policy is happening as I write, driven, for the most part, by the usual suspects.) 
As one long time political scientist told me at the time, “The atmosphere here in the U.S. created by the Ukraine crisis is poisonous – and I say this having been an academic for 37 years.” 
The millennial careerists who help staff the ranks of the New Cold Warriors instinctually reach for ad hominem attacks over reasoned argument – and in so doing helped make way for the tactics the Clinton campaign unleashed in 2016. 
By the time the nominating conventions rolled around this summer, the Clinton campaign was engaged in a Twenty-first Century witch hunt against any Trump adviser who had so much as visited Russia. Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and foreign policy adviser Carter Page were both hounded out of the campaign by Clinton-inspired media smears. 
Clinton’s campaign, which was run by Robby Mook, a 36-year-old hot shot who clearly relished his role as a kind of millennial Roy Cohn, repeatedly attacked former Ambassador to Germany and arms control negotiator under Ronald Reagan, Richard Burt. 
Burt was singled out, not only by the Clinton camp, but by Salon and Newsweek, because he had served as an adviser to Alfa Bank, the Russian bank which played a starring role in former New Republic editor’s Franklin Foer’s thoroughly debunked article on the Trump Organization’s (non-existent) “secret” email server. 
Yet what is most interesting isn’t so much the smears – phrases like “useful idiot” and “Kremlin stooge” which are mostly warmed-over fare from the first Cold War – but the mindset of the New Cold Warriors. How is it that these self-anointed crusaders for “humanitarian intervention” and “democratization,” these self-appointed enemies of tyranny, end up on the side of neo-Nazis in Ukraine, Al Qaeda and al-Nusra affiliate in Syria, all the while stirring up sectarian and nationalist pathologies across the Middle East and Eastern Europe? 
Cold War Nostalgia 
The first thing to recognize is that our New Cold Warriors suffer from la nostalgie de la guerre froide . The historian John Lukacs has written at length on this pathology. In his destined to be classic The End of The Twentieth Century, Lukacs cast a gimlet eye on what he saw as the tendency of academic and media types during the first Cold War to practice “anti-Communism at a safe distance.” Russian President Vladimir Putin answering questions from Russian citizens at his annual Q&A event on April 14, 2016. (Russian government photo) 
This tendency, according to Lukacs, sprang from two sources: first, from a “sense of self-satisfaction: knowing that one is on the right side, on the respectable side together with all of those right-thinking people.” 
Lukacs, himself no apologist for Communism, also observed that this tendency is driven by “the exaggeration of the diabolical powers and machination of Communism and the Communists.” Substitute “Communism and the Communists” for “Putin and the Kremlin” and you have a perfect precis of New Cold Warrior thinking. 
No better example of this tendency to talk a tough game against post-Communist Russia by academics and journalists safe in the knowledge that they will never be called upon to fight, was a conference convened by Franklin Foer’s New Republic in Kiev in May 2014. 
Some background may be in order: The Ukrainian crisis – involving the violent ouster of elected President Viktor Yanukovych on Feb. 22, 2014 – escalated into a full-scale civil war in and around April 6 in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk. The Western-supported government in Kiev, depicting the indigenous anti-coup movement for a Russian invasion, sent its military and privately funded militias to crush the uprising in what was called an “Anti-Terrorism Operation” or ATO. 
To some, it was a tragedy of the first order that Kiev chose war and missed an opportunity to earn – via negotiation and compromise – much needed legitimacy in the east for what was, after all, a junta government. 
Yet others, like Yale University historian Timothy Snyder and the New Republic’s literary editor Leon Wieseltier, embraced the ouster of Yanukovych and were positively exultant; so much so that they wasted little time in making their way to Kiev, “rallying to democracy’s side.” 
The conference, “Ukraine: Thinking Together,” featured several luminaries of the liberal-interventionist left including Franklin Foer; Iraq War apologist Paul Berman; National Endowment for Democracy President Carl Gershman; a founding father of Poland’s Solidarity movement, Adam Michnik; a historian of Eastern Europe, Timothy Garton Ash; and the preening cheerleader of NATO’s war on Libya, Bernard Henri Levy. 
In a note announcing the conference, Wieseltier, sounding an awful lot like Christopher Hitchens in the run-up to the Iraq War, declared: “We cannot just sit back and watch Putin’s imperialism and repression. There are times and places where one must stand up and be counted.” 
From where did this impulse to “stand and up and be counted” arise? Well, Wieseltier’s remarks in Kiev are revealing and are worth quoting at length. In his rhetoric we can hear a not-so-faint echo of Edward Arlington Robinson’s Miniver Cheevy: 
“I watched the progress of Putin’s imperialism beyond his borders and fascism within his borders, I ruefully remarked to Frank Foer that the moment reminded me of what I used to call my Congress for Cultural Freedom-envy — my somewhat facile but nonetheless sincere regret at having been born too late to participate in the struggle of Western intellectuals, some of whom became my teachers and my heroes, against the Stalinist assault on democracy in Europe. And all of a sudden, pondering the Russian aggression in Crimea, and the Russian campaign of destabilization in Ukraine, I realized that I had exaggerated my belatedness. I was not born too late at all.” 
That explains rather a lot. Wieseltier – and in all likelihood Levy and Foer – were suffering from a bad case of history-envy and saw in the crisis in Ukraine a chance to assuage their consciences and prove their worth on the world-historical stage. It is, it must be admitted, an odd way to go about it, socializing in Kiev with a Facebook billionaire , your friends and neocon fellow travelers from the magazine all the while homes, schools and hospitals in eastern Ukraine were being shelled to bits by the very government you traveled so far to “ demonstrate solidarity ” with. 
Putin Hatred 
If Cold War nostalgia plays a role in shaping the weltanschauung of the New Cold Warriors, so too does their uncritical embrace of anyone who opposes Russian President Vladimir Putin. The New Cold Warriors are, in effect, blinded by pseudo-solidarity for Putin’s “victims” like the crass performance artists Pussy Riot and the wondrously corrupt former oligarch-turned-sainted dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Screen shot of the fatal fire in Odessa, Ukraine, on May 2, 2014, that killed scores of ethnic Russians while Ukrainian nationalists cheered. (From RT video) 
And then, of course, there is the new Ukraine where the government, so enthusiastically embraced by Franklin Foer’s New Republic, has embarked on program of de-Communization which, since Ukraine and Communism parted ways a quarter of a century ago, means, in practice, a program of de-Russification, with all that entails, including, a conscious erasure of the Soviet Union’s role in defeating the Nazis and a whitewashing of Ukraine’s ugly history of anti-Semitism, including the role of Stepan Bandera, the wartime leader of the nationalist OUN which was responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews and Poles. 
As the magazine The Forward reported: “The whitewashing, now a disturbingly widespread phenomenon, ramped up in earnest after Ukraine’s 2013–2014 Maidan uprising and the ensuing conflict with Russia. On January 1, 2014, 15,000 ultra-nationalists marched through Kiev carrying placards with [Ukrainian nationalist Stepan] Bandera’s image and chanting OUN slogans; today, marches honoring Bandera, the OUN and Ukrainian SS units take place regularly across Ukraine. 
“In the spring of 2015, Ukraine’s parliament passed a highly controversial law , mandating that Bandera and his groups be regarded as Ukrainian patriots, and making denial of their heroism a criminal offense.” 
In a way, these developments were probably a long time in coming and have been facilitated by the effective disenfranchisement of a large share of the Russo-phone east. Consider the spike in nationalist sentiment in Eastern Europe in the post-Cold War years. 
We return briefly to the historian Lukacs who observed in 1993 “a growing nostalgia and appreciation of nationalist Eastern European governments before and during the Second World War.” He observed that in the years following the fall of the Berlin Wall, “schools and streets” in Slovakia and Croatia were being renamed in honor of Nazi collaborators, while in Romania “the murderous Iron Cross now enjoys a recurrent wave of nostalgic prestige.” 
The American media has willfully turned a blind eye to these similar and ominous developments in Ukraine (to say nothing of the recent torchlight parades in NATO-allied Estonia ) because what matters among the New Cold Warriors is to appear to be “taking a stand” against the Russian bogeyman. 
Ignoring Reality 
And then there is the inability or unwillingness of the New Cold Warriors to take realpolitik considerations into account when it comes to Russia. This is odd, since they are as of one mind when it comes to far more sinister regimes like Saudi Arabia, where people quite literally have their heads chopped off in the middle of the street in broad daylight. Nazi symbols on helmets worn by members of Ukraine’s Azov battalion. (As filmed by a Norwegian film crew and shown on German TV) 
But, they will say, the U.S. needs Saudi Arabia because a) they have oil and b) they oppose the Iranians. As arch-neoconservative Bret Stephens recently said in an exchange with Sen. Rand Paul on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” we are “lucky” to have the Saudis as allies. 
Leave that nonsense aside for the moment: the point is that the facility to think in terms of geo-strategy abandons the New Cold Warriors when it comes to Russia and Vladimir Putin. And so, the fact that Russia does not threaten American interests in our hemisphere; that it did more than most NATO allies to assist in the fight in Afghanistan (via the Northern Distribution Network); that it was a crucial player in the Iranian P5+1 negotiations (which the New Cold Warriors probably hold against the Russians, since they are nearly all opposed to the deal); and that it brokered the deal to dismantle Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons program in Syria are all studiously ignored in their analyses. 
In other words, panic and handwringing over the alleged “cyber war” aside, Putin’s Russia does not threaten U.S. interests, properly defined. Indeed, Russia has, whether we find its domestic politics and widespread government corruption distasteful or not (and I do), proved to be an important partner when its core interests coincide with ours – which is more often than not. 
Interests should drive policy not ephemeral, so-called “shared values” to which the New Cold Warriors themselves only fitfully adhere . 
Twenty-five years ago, one U.S. president sketched out an alternative path to the one that the U.S. has been pursuing since Bill Clinton took office. In a speech much derided by those who practiced “anti-Communism at a safe distance,” President George H.W. Bush traveled to Kiev on Aug. 1, 1991, to warn against succumbing to the siren song of ethno-nationalism. 
“Freedom, democracy, and economic liberty,” said Bush , “No terms have been abused more regularly, nor more cynically than these. Throughout this century despots have masqueraded as democrats, jailers have posed as liberators.” He continued in a vein almost unthinkable by an American president today: “Americans will not support those who seek independence in order to replace a far-off tyranny with a local despotism. They will not aid those who promote a suicidal nationalism based upon ethnic hatred.” 
Bush was prescient: the steady diet of Russophobia and anti-Putin hysteria now underway (and de rigueur among the New Cold Warriors) is fanning the flames of ethno-nationalist hatred within Europe. Does this development enhance or detract from pan-European stability and U.S. national security? 
The answer is clear. And yet the new crusaders persist, and worryingly, as of Tuesday, may have a commander-in-chief who completely shares their views waiting in the wings.

20072,20072,Singer at All-Star Game Adds ‘All Lives Matter’ to Canadian Anthem - The New York Times,Christopher Mele,"The most memorable thing about the   Game on Tuesday night might have been what happened before the first pitch was even thrown: A member of a Canadian quartet singing the country’s national anthem altered some lyrics and held up a sign that said “All Lives Matter. ” The group, the Tenors, which is based in British Columbia, drew heavy criticism on Twitter after one of its members, Remigio Pereira, inserted the political statement while singing “O Canada” before the game at Petco Park in San Diego. Mr. Pereira pulled out the sign from his suit jacket and, during a solo portion of the song, sang: “We’re all brothers and sisters. All lives matter to the great. ” The traditional lyrics at that point in the anthem are: “With glowing hearts we see thee rise. The True North strong and free. ” The other members of the group  —   Clifton Murray, Fraser Walters and Victor Micallef  —   said later they were “shocked and embarrassed” by the actions of Mr. Pereira, whom they described in a statement as being a “lone wolf. ” They added that his stunt was “extremely selfish” and that he would not be performing with the group until further notice. “Our sincere apologies and regrets go out to everybody who witnessed this shameful act, to our fellow Canadians, to Major League Baseball, to our friends, families, fans and to all those affected,” the statement said. “United We Stand” was written on the back of Mr. Pereira’s sign, The Associated Press reported. Major League Baseball had no idea Mr. Pereira planned to make a political statement, a spokesman, Matt Bourne, said. The episode happened against a backdrop of heightened racial tensions in the United States. Last week, two black men were killed in separate police   shootings and five police officers in Dallas were shot and killed by a black man who the authorities said was targeting white officers in retribution. “All Lives Matter” is a statement frequently delivered in response to “Black Lives Matter,” which has been used by activists to call attention to police shootings. The Canadian anthem was not broadcast live on American television, but it aired in Canada. At the stadium, fans reacted with surprise when Mr. Pereira’s sign was broadcast on the scoreboard. But that was nothing compared with the fury that appeared on Twitter: The Tenors were formed in 2007 and have performed more than 500 concerts on five continents and have made over 150 television appearances, according to the group’s biography. The singers appeared at the 2010 Olympic opening ceremony in Vancouver and with artists including Andrea Bocelli, Sting and Elton John. While the change in the anthem’s lyrics was widely criticized, some on Twitter found room for humor:",0

I don’t know about all y’all but I’ve been watching Venezuela like a hawk for at least 10 years, all the way back to when Chavez assumed the presidency and Bush tried to have him assassinated or taken out with a coup. Bush lost. Chavez remained and got the country’s gold back. All 144 tons. He died after a massive looting of the private enterprises. His daughter ended up being worth $4.5 billion and Chavez set in motion the process of systemic destruction of the country. Maduro now has the country in a death spiral, is selling off the gold to Citibank to pay the bills and just announced that the newest currency will would be 200 times more than the largest bill now in circulation. That bill will be 20,000 bolivars. Black market value is $13 USD Currency controls are now in place with limits on ATM withdrawals. IMF estimates inflation of 1600% next year, 2900% in 2018 and 3500% in 2019. Those are low because IMF is wrong on any calculations like this

20076,20076,Social Justice Attorney Andrea Burton: Jailed for Refusing to Remove Black Lives Matter Lapel Pin,Bill Quigley,"Tweet Widget by Bill Quigley 
A young Black lawyer from Youngstown, Ohio, had to sue a judge who held her in contempt of court for wearing a Black Lives Matter pin. The judge said his decision had nothing to do with politics. “The local NAACP chapter questioned that assertion and wondered whether the Judge would have jailed Burton if she was wearing a ‘Support the Troops’ pin.” Atty. Andrea Burton ultimately agreed to wear her pin in the courthouse, but not in the courtroom. Social Justice Attorney Andrea Burton: Jailed for Refusing to Remove Black Lives Matter Lapel Pin by Bill Quigley 
“To remain neutral becomes an accomplice to oppression.” 
Andrea Burton, a 30 year old Ohio criminal defense lawyer, was rocketed onto the national social justice scene this summer after she was handcuffed and jailed for refusing to take off a Black Lives Matter pin while in court. 
Burton’s stance received international attention . “I think that you can’t remain silent or you remain a party to oppression,” she told The Washington Post . “I am usually a pretty agreeable person. I’m always smiling. I’m polite. I have manners. But at some point it eats away at you how any time people see you talk about Black Lives Matter, then you’re being sensitive, you’re the person who’s racist.” In interviews with local media Burton insisted “I'm not anti-police, I work with law enforcement and I hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record, I do believe all lives matter. But at this point they don't all matter equally."" 
The Black Lives Matter pin was about one inch across , the size of a nickel . Burton refused an order to remove the Black Lives matter pin by Youngstown Ohio Judge Robert Milich . Burton told the Judge she was asserting her First Amendment rights . “I said I’m respecting my first amendment right, that I’m not neutral to injustice, and to remain neutral becomes an accomplice to oppression.” The judge held her in contempt of court, jailed her and sentenced her to five days. After being jailed for five hours and the NAACP was called in to help, the judge released Burton pending an appeal of his decision. 
Judge Milich, who was already famous for announcing his refusal to perform any marriages on the day the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same sex marriage, told the media that his own personal opinions had nothing to do with the decision. The local NAACP chapter questioned that assertion and wondered whether the Judge would have jailed Burton if she was wearing a “Support the Troops” pin. When asked by The Daily Beast , whether he would jail a lawyer for wearing a pin that said Support Our Troops, he refused to say. “I can’t speculate on what a political pin might be until I look at it. I just used the definition in the Black’s Law Library Dictionary, and the standard dictionary of what’s political.” The Judge further muddied the waters when he said “There’s a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pin that’s on a political issue.” 
“Burton told the Judge she was asserting her First Amendment rights.” 
Burton paid a high price for her convictions. After she was jailed, Burton, who had been previously regularly appointed to represent numerous Youngstown Municipal criminal defendants , said she was “frozen out” of the appointment process for representing criminal defendants and received no appointments at all. 
Burton then filed a federal civil rights damages actio n against Judge Milich, the other Youngstown Municipal Judge, and the City of Youngstown for violations of her constitutional rights to Freedom of Speech, Due Process and Equal Protection. In the civil rights case, filed in the Northern District of Ohio, Burton pointed out police officers were in the same courtroom with black tape over their badges and the judge did nothing to them. After court monitored settlement discussions, Burton agreed to drop her federal civil rights case. In return the Judge agreed to drop her contempt charge. Burton said she will continue to wear her BLM pin in the courthouse but not inside the courtroom. Further, the settlement provided that local judges agreed not to retaliate against her and will fully consider her requests for future appointments to court-appointed cases. 
Who is this brave lawyer? 
Beginnings 
Burton grew up in Youngstown, Ohio in a family active in the civil rights movement. “My grandfather marched on Washington with Martin Luther King ,” said Burton. “He was a good friend of A. Phillip Randolph . He protested in the South during the Civil Rights Movements and attended the 1963 March on Washington. He was one of the first black Councilpersons for Youngstown. My mother was pretty active in the black awakening during the 60s. She was fairly militant about civil rights as a teen and was what we know now as a feminist.” 
Some of her courage is no doubt due to her upbringing. Burton’s older brother was born with a rare genetic disorder that left him mentally disabled and very sickly as a child. Dad operated a successful business despite addiction issues until his death when Burton was 15. Mom, a legal secretary and later a court bailiff, did heroic work caring for the family. 
“My mother’s compassion and dedication greatly influenced how empathetic I have become. She pushed me greatly to do more than what was expected, to excel when it would be simpler to be typical. She never told me that there was anything I could not do if I set my sights on achieving it. She worked hard to make the resources available to me if I actually wanted them. Both my parents were college educated. Both were heavily invested in learning. 
“My parents never really treated me as a child so I was often exposed to difficult realties and frank conversations. I was conscious of the ways people were different (i.e., gender, orientation, race, or class) but how it did not matter at all in determining their worth.” 
Studies 
Burton always did well in school. “I was expected to be a good student. My father was relentless about math grades and performances especially. I won a sport in the Junior Statesman Program at Georgetown University to study government when I was 16 years old. It was a highly competitive program that included people from all over the world. 
Burton earned a scholarship and graduated from Youngstown State University in 2008 in pre-law and journalism. She was awarded another scholarship to study for her Masters in Library and Information Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . 
“I decided to become a lawyer as I finished my bachelor’s degree.” So after she received her graduate degree she returned to Ohio and commuted from home to attend the University of Akron School of Law . “The best part of law school was working in the legal clinic.” There she wrote appellate briefs for prisoners, provided legal research to inmates, handled applications for clemency to the governor and other pro bono services to low income individuals. She took social justice classes when she could and wrote a major paper on Kelley Williams-Bolar who was convicted of a felony for enrolling her children in another better school district. “I wanted to study why anyone would commit a felony to educate their kids, why was it necessary? What differences where there?” 
“She wrote appellate briefs for prisoners, provided legal research to inmates, handled applications for clemency.” 
After becoming a lawyer, Burton began a small private practice and spent a lot of her time working as a public defender. “It was a shock,” Burton admits. “People with power and influence held some bigoted ideas. People were not treated fairly and it was quite disheartening. 
“As a criminal defense lawyer, I am motivated by humanity, compassion and the oath I took to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I am often asked how I could represent those accused of crimes, some heinous crimes. I see criminal defense work as an opportunity to make sure that the promise that the criminal justice system makes “innocent until proven guilty” is followed. Getting convictions and imparting justice are two very different things. My job is to make sure that statutes and rules are followed to guarantee a fair and impartial trial. Politics should not factor into that. I am merely an instrument of justice but I take my role extremely seriously. 
“It is sometimes challenging to work with other attorneys and people in the justice system who are oblivious to the discrepancies people of color and impoverished people experience within the system that is set up to eradicate those inequities. I am also disappointed in people who accept the status quo just because it is easy and convenient. We need to be willing to continually re-evaluate our role in furthering injustice. 
Justice 
“Justice sometimes comes slowly, through time, by the changing of minds through understanding and experience. Other times it is the result of tumultuous uncertain revolutions. The problem with maintaining justice is that often we only recognize what justice is by seeing injustice. Sometimes the world needs a major event, a major catalyst to stir change. That process is often frightening. To me, living in a world where we value some more than others is unjust. Especially when some are undervalued to the point that people are systematically dying. When people are too afraid to have an informed dialogue about how factors intersect to create injustice that perpetuates injustice. Willful blindness in the face of a wealth of information is the greatest threat to civilization today. 
Sustainability 
“One of the ways I sustain myself is that I read continuously. I read philosophy as well as political and spiritual texts. I have a close friend that I speak with virtually every week. He has been a savior for me since I was 17 years old. We understand each other because we are both avid readers, with similar interests in philosophy and in that we both have always felt a sense of isolation and disconnection from our peers. This is important because I think that more and more people feel a sense of disconnect from the world despite the many connections created through social media. 
“When someone asks me for a book recommendation, I suggest Strength to Love by Martin Luther King Jr. It is a religious book, but I do not read it simply for the Christian aspects of it. I read it because it’s empowering, powerful and because King was an extremely smart compassionate person and it shows. I also read Nietzsche religiously. 
“I am involved in the YWCA which is dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all. 
“My dream is that differences in color would actually be as relevant as shoe size and that religious fanaticism would disappear.” 
Advice to Law Students 
“Learn to see value in every human being and truly read the papers that are the foundation of this Country. Study and understand the Constitution and The Federalist Papers . They demonstrate how this democracy was formulated. Know your history because it shapes today in ways you will never appreciate fully otherwise. Be prepared to examine yourself for your own conflicts in logic and your own biases. Learn how lawyers can become accomplices to injustice, even if unintentionally. 
Role Models 
“ Harriet Tubman , Sojourner Truth , Alexander Hamilton , W.E.B Du Bois , Langston Hughes , James Baldwin , Gandhi , Malala Yousafzai , Martin Luther King , A. Phillip Randolph , Rosa Parks , Thurgood Marshall , Ralph Abernathy , and Joseph Lowery inspire me. Malcolm X of course. And our President Barack Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama . I am also inspired by the countless individuals who face oppression and injustice in their lives daily but continue to work toward a better world. I am inspired by those who fight for those who are limited in power or face nearly insurmountable odds. I think the work of those individuals is the key to making the world a place where love conquers hate and fear. 
Conclusion 
“The day I wore that button and was found in contempt changed my life, the effect of it are still rippling, some in destructive ways and others in very inspiring ways. I wore it because my soul was so tired from all the inequities I had seen over my 4 years of practice. I was exhausted from losing a series of small battles for understanding for my vulnerable clients. I was tired of the indifference of the prosecutorial offices. And all I could think to do was wear this button for a little joy. For a small win. To hope to change someone’s mind. Bill Quigley teaches law at Loyola University New Orleans.",1
20077,20077,The Modern History of ‘Rigged’ US Elections,WashingtonsBlog,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by WashingtonsBlog 
By Robert Parry, the investigative reporter who many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s. Originally published at Parry’s Consortium News (republished with permission). 
The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the world’s “gold standard” that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The “wise men” of the system simply insist otherwise. 
We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens’ judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000). Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan photographed together in the Oval Office in 1991. (Cropped from a White House photo that also included Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.) 
Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated. 
The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nation’s leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized. 
Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldn’t vote). 
That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners. 
Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century. 
Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks. 
Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedy’s vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the South’s heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners. 
However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixon’s Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960. 
Nixon’s ‘Treason’ 
So, by 1968, the Democrats’ once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didn’t want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that — with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided — President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam. President Richard Nixon with his then-National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in 1972. 
The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixon’s campaign went behind Johnson’s back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnson’s Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixon’s emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam. 
Though Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixon’s “treason” — from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election — he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford – three pillars of the Establishment – expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking: 
“Some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that I’m wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [Nixon] elected,” Clifford said. “It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our country’s interests.” 
Clifford’s words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of America’s electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process. 
To this day, the major U.S. news media will not directly address the issue of Nixon’s treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas. In a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the library’s archivists call the file on Nixon’s sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their “X-file.” [For details, see Consortiumnews.com’s “ LBJ’s ‘X-File’ on Nixon’s ‘Treason. ’”] 
The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixon’s paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his “treason” – top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJ’s presidency – led to Nixon’s creation of the “plumbers,” a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the “plumbers” became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee’s headquarters at the Watergate in Washington. National Security Adviser Walt Rostow shows President Lyndon Johnson a model of a battle near Khe Sanh in Vietnam. (U.S. Archive Photo) 
Although the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major U.S. news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixon’s far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking Johnson’s Vietnam peace talks while 500,000 American soldiers were in the war zone. In part because of Nixon’s sabotage — and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome — the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968. [See Consortiumnews.com’s “ The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .”] 
In effect, Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixon’s strange personality. However, even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting president’s foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign. 
Reagan’s ‘October Surprise’ Caper 
In that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reagan’s campaign feared that Carter might pull off an “October Surprise” by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reagan’s team take action to block Carter’s October Surprise? President Ronald Reagan, delivering his Inaugural Address on Jan. 20, 1981, as the 52 U.S. hostages in Iran are simultaneously released. 
The testimonial and documentary evidence that Reagan’s team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carter’s October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixon’s Paris peace talk maneuver. 
That evidence indicates that Reagan’s campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages’ release before Election Day, after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, who was Reagan’s vice presidential running mate. 
By early November 1980, the public’s obsession with Iran’s humiliation of the United States and Carter’s inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide. When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reagan’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of Reagan. 
Bolstered by his image as a tough guy, Reagan enacted much of his right-wing agenda, including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the Great American Middle Class. 
Behind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Iran’s cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush with CIA Director William Casey at the White House on Feb. 11, 1981. (Photo credit: Reagan Library) 
In summer 1981, when Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Nicholas Veliotes learned about the arms shipments to Iran, he checked on their origins and said, later in a PBS interview: 
“It was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment. … [This operation] seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration. And I understand some contacts were made at that time.” 
Those early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the Iran-Contra Affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reagan’s beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaragua’s leftist government. 
While many facts of the Iran-Contra scandal were revealed by congressional and special-prosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the origins of the Reagan-Iran relationship was always kept hazy. The Republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts, but the Democrats were almost as reluctant to go there. 
A half-hearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on then-President George H.W. Bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation. In other words, Bush, who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with Iran, was entrusted with proving his own guilt. 
Tired of the Story 
By the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 “October Surprise” question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991. PBS Frontline’s: The Election Held Hostage, co-written by Robert Parry and Robert Ross. 
However, by fall 1991, just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at Newsweek, along with The New Republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israel’s exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 “October Surprise” case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Casey’s attendance at a conference in London in July 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostages. 
Although the bogus Newsweek/New Republic “London alibi” would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the President’s flanks, the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation. 
Meanwhile, Bush’s State Department and White House counsel’s office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena. 
Years later, I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station, Texas, confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980. The U.S. Embassy’s confirmation of Casey’s trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape. 
Williamson said that among the State Department “material potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was] a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown,” Beach noted in a “ memorandum for record ” dated Nov. 4, 1991. 
Two days later, on Nov. 6, Beach’s boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bush’s reelection hopes in 1992. C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel under President George H.W. Bush. 
At the meeting, Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the Iran-Contra investigation. The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George H.W. Bush’s reelection campaign. As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke, put it , the White House goal in 1991 was to “kill/spike this story.” 
Gray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session. “Whatever form they ultimately take, the House and Senate ‘October Surprise’ investigations, like Iran-Contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President ,” Gray declared, according to minutes . [Emphasis in original.] 
Among “touchstones” cited by Gray were “No Surprises to the White House, and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time. This is Partisan.” White House “talking points” on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings. 
Timid Democrats 
But Bush’s White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received – and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993 – there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reagan’s election victory. Former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana. 
That would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process – and that, as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be “good for the country.” 
In 2014 when I sent a copy of Beach’s memo regarding Casey’s trip to Madrid to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task force’s dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issue. 
“The [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the trip” to Madrid, Hamilton told me. “Should they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that.” 
Asked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task force’s dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task force’s investigation. 
“If the White House knew that Casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us,” Hamilton said, adding that “you have to rely on people” in authority to comply with information requests. But that trust was at the heart of the inquiry’s failure. With the money and power of the American presidency at stake, the idea that George H.W. Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was naïve in the extreme. 
Arguably, Hamilton’s timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bush’s team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. Then, Hamilton’s investigative conclusion reinforced the “group think” dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a “conspiracy theory” when it was anything but. In the years since, Hamilton hasn’t done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocent. 
Still, among the few people who have followed this case, the October Surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key Republicans didn’t make any sense . 
But the dismissive “group think” remains undisturbed as far as the major U.S. media and mainstream historians are concerned.

Past as Prologue 
Lee Hamilton’s decision to “clear” Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bush’s rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000. President George W. Bush is introduced by his brother Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before delivering remarks at Sun City Center, Florida, on May 9, 2006. (White House photo by Eric Draper) 
Indeed, if the full truth had been told about the father’s role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, it’s hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush “stolen election” in 2000. 
Regarding Election 2000, the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W. Bush. But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, and then on five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Florida’s electoral votes and thus the presidency. 
The reality of Gore’s rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Florida’s disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted. 
However, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, so The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House. Surely, telling the American people that fact amid the 9/11 crisis would not be “good for the country.” 
So, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery – that the so-called “over-votes” in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices’ names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the “under-votes” that hadn’t registered on antiquated voting machines. “Over-votes” would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on “clear intent of the voter.” 
However, instead of leading with Gore’s rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred. Former Vice President Al Gore. (Photo credit: algore.com) 
On Nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Gore’s victory. In a story that day, I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. They had hid the reality for “the good of the country,” much as Johnson’s team had done in 1968 regarding Nixon’s sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamilton’s inquiry had done regarding the 1980 “October Surprise” case. 
Within a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnews.com, I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-Times executive editor Howell Raines. I got the impression that Barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didn’t accept the Bush-won conventional wisdom. 
However, this violation of objective and professional journalism – bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle – was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. It was about the future. 
By misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000 – even if the media’s motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks – the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. [For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.com’s “ Gore’s Victory ,” “ So Bush Did Steal the White House ,” and “ Bush v. Gore’s Dark American Decade. ”] 
A Phalanx of Misguided Consensus 
Looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the “stolen” elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful “losers” are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters’ will had been ignored or twisted. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. 
Al Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court, who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds, as Justice Antonin Scalia said, that a count that showed Gore winning (when the Court’s majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush) would undermine Bush’s “legitimacy.” 
Similarly, Rep. Hamilton is regarded as a modern “wise man,” in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didn’t ruffle too many feathers. 
But the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies – uttered for “the good of the country” – is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest. 
So, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isn’t pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. 
Trump’s complaints about “rigged” elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they don’t succeed at “stealing” the election from white people. 
There is a racist undertone to Trump’s version of a “rigged” democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. He’s just not honest about what those flaws are. 
The hard truth is that the U.S. political process is not democracy’s “gold standard”; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.",1
20078,20078,Astronomers Think They Have Just Discovered Messages Sent from Aliens,The Anti-Media,"
By Jake Anderson
Anomalous signals from deep space often evoke a quick pulse of gossip and speculation about aliens that dies off soon thereafter, when scientists are able to explain it. Usually, the explanation involves a natural cosmic process — an asteroid, space detritus, or frequencies from an exploded star.
Sometimes, however, the signals are too mysterious to explain. There’s a reason why you may have seen a sustained social media buzz regarding aliens this past week. A few days ago, two scientists from Laval University in Quebec released a paper arguing they may have just received our first communication from extraterrestrials.
First, a bit of context. This has been an exciting decade for those of us who stargaze in awe, wondering how many sentient beings live in this incomprehensibly enormous universe of ours. First, the search for exoplanets accelerated dramatically, aided by the Kepler telescope, which has identified over 1,000 planets outside of our solar system.
While scientists have long known that our Milky Way galaxy alone probably contains several hundred billion planets , the ability to study them had eluded us until fairly recently (this ability will be exponentially augmented when the James Webb telescope allows us to analyze exoplanets’ atmospheres and search for traces of industrial gasses). Additionally, the discovery of Earth-like exoplanets — some of which are conceivably close enough to visit in a few decades — has tantalizing ramifications for our near future human race.
Earlier this year, scientists announced the incredible observation of a series of inexplicable brightness frequencies from the star KIC 8462852, which led many to speculate the signals could have been originating from a Dyson sphere , a theoretical megastructure by which an advanced alien race (a Kardschez type 2 civilization ) could harness the power of its sun. The newest discovery from this star has made it even more unlikely that the signals are from natural causes.
The newest strange signals hail from a gaggle of some 234 stars identified by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which analyzed the spectra of 2.5 million stars. E.F. Borra and E. Trottier, the two astronomers who discovered the anomalies, discussed them in their paper , which was originally titled “Signals probably from Extraterrestrial Intelligence.”
“We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an [extraterrestrial intelligence] signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis,” they wrote.
“The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the ETI hypothesis.” 
Of course, it is far from certain that these are actual alien messages. In an interview with none other than Snopes.com , Borra claimed he never actually used the word ‘probably’ and that further confirmation was needed.
The director of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute , Andrew Siemion, issued an admonishing response:
“You can’t make such definitive statements about detections unless you’ve exhausted every possible means of follow-up.” 
So why is everyone so excited? The discovery appears to match a prediction Borra made in 2012 when he claimed aliens could very well use intermittent bursts of laser as a means of communication.
For his part, Siemion plans to use his Breakthrough Listen Initiative to more closely assess several stars from the 234 sample. Meanwhile, Borra andTrottier, Borra’s graduate student, will continue observing the mysterious signals.
It’s an exciting decade for space research. With plans for a mission to Mars in the hopper, as well as an exploratory probe that will be sent to the moon Europa, we may be witnessing the rebirth of the Space Race. What better incentive could there be to venture further into space than the call of an alien species?
Let’s hope that by the time we meet them, our own species will have transcended its addiction to war and unsustainable resource allocation. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

20079,20079,Mitch McConnell Sees ‘High Level of Satisfaction’ With Trump Administration - The New York Times,Carl Hulse,"WASHINGTON  —   Although there is plenty of anxiety in Washington about the shaky early performance of the Trump administration, don’t count Senator Mitch McConnell among the hand wringers. Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and the majority leader, says he and his Senate Republican colleagues are quite satisfied with the Trump team so far. In fact, he said, they are reassured by signs that President Trump is going to hew to a conservative agenda after early fears that the president  —   a relatively unknown quantity to most elected Republicans  —   might not really be one of them. “The country doesn’t need saving,” Mr. McConnell said when asked during an interview in his Capitol office if there was any cause for a   congressional intervention given early chaos in the evolving West Wing. “I think there is a high level of satisfaction with the new administration,” he said, dismissing concerns about dissonant eruptions from the new president and some of his top staff members. “Our members are not obsessed with the daily tweets, but are looking at the results. ” He added: “No matter what sort of theatrics that go on around the administration, if you look at the decisions that are being made, they are solid  —   from our perspective  —      things that we would have hoped a new Republican president would have done. ” Mr. McConnell has broken with the president on a few subjects, taking a much harder line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than Mr. Trump has and objecting to some of the president’s “drain the swamp” initiatives, including a proposal for congressional term limits. Other members of the Republican establishment  —   inside and outside Congress  —   have expressed growing alarm about the conduct and competence of the White House. But Mr. McConnell, whose wife, Elaine Chao, was named by Mr. Trump as secretary of transportation, said things might even be turning out better than anticipated. “Back during the campaign, there were a lot of questions: Is Trump really a conservative? A lot of questions about it,” Mr. McConnell recalled. “But if you look at the steps that have been taken so far, looks good to me. “It is the kind of thing we would have expected of one of the others, had they been nominated and elected,” Mr. McConnell said, referring to Republican presidential candidates defeated by Mr. Trump who had more conventional political and government backgrounds. Mr. McConnell’s view clashes violently with that of Senate Democrats and their allies around the country. They have viewed the beginning of the Trump era as a disaster best exemplified by an immigration executive order they decry as unconstitutional and   as well as a selection of cabinet choices they rate as unqualified and carrying the very same baggage that has prevented others from being confirmed in the past. Even some Republicans have criticized as inept and amateurish the rollout of the immigration order, which is now at the center of a federal court fight. Others have expressed trepidation at the prospect of being hammered in a Trump tweet if they run afoul of the new president. Mr. McConnell, who is known for being able to take the temperature of his colleagues and to act accordingly, said he sensed no real unease about Mr. Trump on the Republican side of the aisle. “We have had very good unity on our side,” Mr. McConnell said. “People are genuinely excited about taking the country in another direction. I don’t find any decision that he has made surprising. ” He said Senate Republicans had been enthusiastic about Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees, dazzled by his Supreme Court pick and elated at the chance to roll back what he called the regulatory rampage of the Obama administration. “A lot of us were wondering, what is Trump really going to be like?” Mr. McConnell said. “He used to support Democrats and have various views earlier in his life about politics. But when he got to the point of actually having the office and making the decisions, I think the decisions have been very comforting to my members, most of whom are a little bit right of center and further right of center. ” It goes without saying that having Mr. Trump in the White House gives House and Senate Republicans the opportunity to pursue an aggressive legislative agenda if they can find common ground. That prospect should be heightened by installing colleagues like Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and two fellow Republicans, Representatives Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Tom Price of Georgia, at the highest levels of the administration. Mr. Sessions is Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general while Mr. Mulvaney has been tapped to run the White House Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. McConnell looms as potentially the president’s most important ally in Congress because success in the Senate is central to any legislative victory. But Republicans have not even started on the legislative end of the new Congress. Now their job is going to be made more difficult by the increasingly hard line that Democrats are taking against Mr. Trump by opposing his cabinet nominees en masse. Mr. McConnell’s frustration at Democratic tactics boiled over Tuesday evening when he invoked a rarely used Senate rule to force Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, to end a speech on the grounds she was impugning the integrity of Mr. Sessions, a fellow senator, by criticizing his record on civil rights. “It is a superficially poisonous atmosphere, not a fundamentally poisonous atmosphere,” Mr. McConnell said. Still, he noted that Republicans could do much of their preliminary work in the Senate just by relying on their party’s 51 votes there as they take up health care, tax changes and nominations, and could try to work out the differences with Democrats later. “Sooner or later we will get around to things that will require some level of cooperation,” Mr. McConnell said. “Hopefully there will be a kind of dysfunction fatigue. I think it will set in way before then. ” His point raises a question: Will that same passage of time produce a kind of Trump fatigue among the   congressional Republicans?",0
20080,20080,"Amid Opioid Overdoses, Ohio Coroner’s Office Runs Out of Room for Bodies - The New York Times",Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura,"The bodies just keep arriving. On Thursday, only two days into February, the coroner’s office in Dayton, Ohio, had already handled 25 deaths  —   18 caused by drug overdoses. In January, the office processed 145 cases in which the victims’ bodies had been destroyed by opioids. Now, the Montgomery County Coroner’s Office is so crammed with corpses that it has asked a local funeral parlor to take in four bodies for “temporary storage,” the first time it has had to make such a request, Kenneth M. Betz, director of the coroner’s office, said on Thursday. “We’re running at full capacity,” he said in a phone interview. “We’ve never experienced this volume of accidental drug overdoses in our history. We now call funeral homes immediately” to ask if there is space available, he added. Widespread abuse of powerful opioid pain relievers in the United States  —   including oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone and fentanyl, heroin’s cheaper but deadlier cousin  —   has driven overdose death rates to historic highs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The C. D. C. ’s numbers show that 91 people in the United States die every day from opioid overdose. The number of bodies from accidental overdoses that have come to the Montgomery County Coroner’s Office in the first 33 days of the year  —   163  —   is already more than half the yearly totals for the past two years. In 2015, the total was 259 last year, the number of deaths from January to September was 253,  figures from the office show. In Ohio, fatal overdoses more than quadrupled in the past decade and by 2007 had surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of accidental death, according to the Department of Health. In 2015, 3, 310 deaths were recorded in the state from unintentional drug overdoses, a 21. 5 percent increase from the previous year, according to the C. D. C. Addiction is so entrenched and widespread that police officials say there are now third and fourth generations of prescription drug abusers. These days, hospitals in Cincinnati require drug testing of new mothers and infants because of a surge in newborns exposed to addictive drugs. The five states with the highest rates of death linked to drug overdose were West Virginia (41. 5 per 100, 000) New Hampshire (34. 3 per 100, 000) Kentucky (29. 9 per 100, 000) Ohio (29. 9 per 100, 000) and Rhode Island (28. 2 per 100, 000) according to the C. D. C. But significant increases were also seen in the Northeast and the South, the agency said, including Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Last year, Mr. Betz said Montgomery County’s coroner’s office had to use refrigerated trucks to store bodies for a week. In his 40 years in forensics, Mr. Betz said, he has never seen such a steady increase in overdose deaths, and it has left him and his colleagues feeling overwhelmed. “Our staff is, quite frankly, tired,” he said. “The doctors are tired. The investigators are tired. We’ve never had volumes like this. ” “This increase from year to year  —   I’ve never seen anything like this,” he said. “The drug problem we have is absolutely phenomenal. ”",0
20081,20081,Front-Page Editorials Aim to Soothe the Grief-Stricken - The New York Times,Sydney Ember,"Last month, on the day after a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. The Orlando Sentinel ran a   editorial with the headline, “Our Community Will Heal. ” And on Sunday, three days after a sniper killed five police officers during a protest in downtown Dallas, The Dallas Morning News responded with its own   editorial, featuring an image of an eye shedding a tear. “This city, our city, has been tested before,” the editorial said. “Now we face a new test. ” As spasms of violence continue to tear apart cities across the country, newspapers have been using   editorials as a salve for healing   communities. But more than that, the front page has come to reflect the rising frustration of a fractured country reeling from bloodshed. “There’s no doubt that   editorials have come more into some prominence in the last year or so,” said Al Tompkins, a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute. “I think it’s a way of trying to tap into the public consciousness. ” In the last several months, The Boston Globe and The New York Times have both printed   editorials calling for stricter regulation of guns in the aftermath of mass shootings. It was the first time since 1920 that The Times had run an editorial on Page 1. The   which had its own mass shooting to cover when a student at Virginia Tech shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 others on campus in 2007, ran a   editorial on Saturday that pleaded for a détente of sorts. “Let’s just stop and mourn and wonder how in the world America became this unspeakably, relentlessly terrorized place,” it said. The Daily News of New York has used its front page in recent months as an editorial vehicle to inveigh against violence and congressional inaction in the face of it, including one last month with the image of the dome of the Capitol soaked in blood. While many   editorials are intended to soothe and promote resolve, other bold decisions by news organizations have been criticized as sowing divisiveness. The New York Post, for instance, was excoriated on Friday for deciding to use the headline “Civil War” on its front page on the Dallas shooting. A headline on the conservative Drudge Report, “Black Lives Kill,” also drew harsh rebukes. Like other editorials, the one in The Dallas Morning News addressed the violence gripping the country. “We are surely not alone in asking, as our hearts break, what kind of country are we creating where such violence has become so frequent?” the editorial said. But it also acknowledged the city’s deep divisions and urged more compassion. “We live together, but we do not often understand one another. This is because of class, sometimes geography and often race,” it said. “There will be time later for anger and for justice  —   anger whose purpose is served in justice,” the editorial added. “But for now we need to learn to understand each other, to really hear one another, to learn from each other. ” Mike Wilson, the newspaper’s editor, said in a statement that the editorial was intended to provide a “quiet place” for reflection. “After two days of covering violence and heartbreak, we felt the need to pause for a moment and speak directly to the community,” he said. “We had two simple questions: What kind of city are we? What kind of city do we want to be? “In the midst of so much noise and pain, we needed a quiet place for that conversation,” he added. “Sunday’s front page is that quiet place. ”",0
20082,20082,Juror explanation for Ammon Bundy verdict,Alex Ansary,"Juror explanation for Ammon Bundy verdict 11/03/2016 
OREGONLIVE 
Juror 4 has so far provided the only public explanation of the behind-the-scenes discussions that led to the acquittal of Ammon Bundy, his brother and five others on federal conspiracy charges stemming from the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation. 
Readers have asked to hear more from him about the jury’s reasoning in reaching the surprising decision. 
Juror 4 – a 44-year-old business administration student at Marylhurst University who served in the Navy during the Iraq War – went into detail in a series of email exchanges with The Oregonian/OregonLive that were used in news stories. 
Here’s a transcript of the emails, with some minor editing for brevity or clarity. He’s asked not to be identified for fear of retribution. The judge sealed the names of all nine women and three men on the jury, citing public safety. 
Juror 4 makes references to U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown; prosecutor Ethan Knight; Juror 11 who the judge removed from the jury after Juror 4 questioned his objectivity; Juror 18, who replaced Juror 11; and Ryan Payne, one of the leaders of the occupation with Ammon Bundy. 
He also references a Jan. 2 rally for Harney County ranchers and then the takeover of the refuge later that day. 
All seven defendants faced a charge of conspiring to impede employees of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service or U.S. Bureau of Land Management from doing their work through intimidation, threat or force during the 41-day occupation. 
His initial email: 
It should be known that all 12 jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove “conspiracy” in the count itself – and not any form of affirmation of the defense’s various beliefs, actions, or aspirations. Proving the elements of conspiracy, especially given the body of evidence we were forced to restrict ourselves to consider when judging, was far too great a standard to meet (without using our imaginations, prejudices, etc.). 
The judge floored us when she said that there was no statute against impeding federal officers (by force, threat, or intimidation), nor was there a significant penalty applied to criminal trespass. We all queried about alternative charges that could stick and were amazed that this ‘conspiracy’ charge seemed the best possible option. It was not lost on us that our verdict(s) might inspire future actions that are regrettable, but that sort of thinking was not permitted when considering the charges before us. 
The prosecution asked us to neglect Judge Brown’s final (binding) instructions when they asserted in closing that adverse possession = conspiracy to impede (as per Mr. Knight’s closing argument), as if defining actions was all that was needed to convict. All 12 agreed that impeding existed, even if as an effect of the occupation, and that something was very wrong. But we were not asked to judge on bullets and hurt feelings, rather to decide if an agreement was made with an illegal object in mind. It seemed this basic, high standard of proof was lost upon the prosecution throughout. Inference, while possibly compelling, proved to be insulting or inadequate to 12 diversely situated people as a means to convict. The air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of us, nor was it warranted given their burden of proof. 
Regarding my role in crafting the letter that led to the dismissal of juror 11, I can say that it was not only necessary but also borne out of much patience in dealing with a fellow who had zero business being on this jury in the first place. He effectively wasted a great deal of our time as he (irrationally) promoted his theory of conspiracy despite the absence of evidence. Also, he violated Judge Brown’s explicit orders by hearkening to ‘evidence’ that was never admitted in this case, refused to consider the defendant’s state of mind, and used imaginative theories to explain key actions. How this juror slipped through the cracks is mind boggling and very disconcerting. 
You should know that the sentiments expressed in that letter were the exact thoughts I had when juror 11 first made his opening remarks on day one of deliberations, but I resisted the impulse to send the question at that time and give this fellow the chance to convince/explain. It seemed wise to suspend my shock/disbelief in him until a thorough examination of his mindset was complete (and the other jurors could weigh in themselves on his various theories). The vast majority of time was spent trying to deal with his bizarre theories, compared against what was admitted and/or expected of us as standards of judgment. While I wish now that I had sent the letter on day one, since it would have alleviated much stress for all of us, I would wish to have the time/opportunity to expand or alter my perspective that we afforded him. 
As I peruse the responses of many interested parties in this case, many of which express ‘profound regret’ over the verdicts, I am baffled by the flippant sentiments that seem to dominate the landscape. Several questions immediately percolate in my mind: do these folks even know what it took to arrive at a verdict on any one of these counts? How could 12 diverse people find such agreement unless there was a colossal failure on the part of the prosecution? Don’t they know that ‘not guilty’ does not mean ‘innocent’? I have many such thoughts swirling around in my head that I’d like to vent, but I need to break it off for now. 
*** 

We asked a series of follow-up questions : How did the jury feel about starting all over again? Did other jurors know about your note regarding Juror 11 — and how did they react to it? How did the jury start anew? Why the substantially shorter time period for the final verdicts? 

Juror 4’s response: 
The feeling, at the time of the reset, was universal relief that we even had a chance to hear from a more objective juror. It was not a relief to think we could be there today (Friday ) or Monday, frankly, but all said they were more than willing to start over in order to erase the ill feelings created while deliberating with juror 11. We had no knowledge about juror 18’s leanings in any regard prior to her coming in (we maintained a strict standard to not discuss the case with each other before deliberating). 
Only juror #1 knew about my note (since he had to pass it on to the judge), or so I thought. Juror 11, when we later were arguing about his bias, said he knew what I must have been doing when I folded a note and quietly handed it to Juror 1. My note was a last resort, frankly, because I made the entire jury uneasy by directly challenging juror 11 (on Tuesday morning; more than 16 hours of deliberations had passed) about his stated bias. Many jurors were upset at my direct approach and seemingly personal challenge to him. What I had said to him was far more upsetting than the contents of my note, and so I don’t think the jurors should have been surprised. Of course, I didn’t openly state to the jury that I had an open question before the court until the next morning (Wednesday) when juror 11 played the victim. I again reiterated that this whole issue was of his own making, and although he calmly explained what his bias was or meant to him in this case, I was anxious to hear from the court. 
It is a fact that we were so exhausted by this time that we nearly submitted final ballots on Wednesday, with juror 11’s input (equaling a mistrial on most counts). It is also true that I told the jury that if I did not get an answer to my question from the court, I would be forced to take my grievance to the media immediately afterwards. We had no idea of what had transpired in court as a result of my question, but you begin to feel neglected after almost 24 hours of silence. 
All of the other 10 jurors were relieved that juror 11 was excused, and most of them personally thanked me for doing what I did (even though I upset them in the process). 
Starting anew was filled with trepidation by the remaining 11 jurors, because we didn’t want to allow any whiff of prior deliberations to influence our new juror. This was all about her, frankly. We let her purge her feelings, as we all had the opportunity to do, and we let her direct the review of evidence. To her credit, she was fairly focused on getting her thoughts communicated quickly and purposefully so that time was not lost. The rapidity of her pace caused us to caution her, slow her a bit, but she was very business-like. It was clear that by 11:00 a.m., our new juror had resolved any questions regarding counts 1 and 2. She was relieved, and perhaps a bit surprised, that there was unanimity on these points. 
While we had a robust process for counts 4 and 5, we had reached a point of impasse by 2:00. There were no throw away words expressed on this day. The extremes we felt pressed into really crystallized our purpose, even if we had to go through the essential elements again, and it made for a swift process. 
Before we sent our final word to the court, I asked our new juror if she could explain why this process was so fast, to which she replied confidently and affirmatively. She’s a sharp lady and can handle herself, I think. 

Q. Wondered if there were turning points or particular moments in the trial that stuck out for jurors in helping the jury reach the not guilty pleas. 
A. Turning points? Let me begin by speaking for myself before I attempt to recall those of others. I expected there to be a witness to the January 2nd meeting at Ye Olde Castle before the protest/rally that would confirm the prosecution’s assertion of intent to impede, and the absence of such evidence became a seed of doubt that grew. I expected that there must be proof of conspiracy between Ammon and Ryan Payne (most logical link, owing to their initial visit to the Hammond’s place in early November) but he wasn’t even called for either side, nor were there any phone calls, emails, etc. that would demonstrate agreement here. These two major holes in the evidence record proved to cause insurmountable doubt for me. 
Others said that, while the evidence record was not adequate, certain moments turned them. One said they did a full 180 degree turn when they realized there were six informants that went unnamed on the refuge during the occupation, and the choice of the prosecution to allow that much room for mysterious influence there (remember Fabio?) was decisive. One said that the doctrine of adverse possession seemed to govern every thought, word, and deed of the ‘leadership’ such that it could not be deemed intent to impede federal workers. Another said that the repeated objections to the reading of the constitution became a wedge issue for them. Those turning points are the most distinct ones I can remember, and so I’ll leave it there. 
Q. What about counts 4 and 5? What was the thinking with those? (Count 4 was a property theft charge against defendant Kennth Medenbach for driving a refuge truck to the Safeway in Burns and Count 5 was a property theft charge against Ryan Bundy for helping to remove FBI surveillance cameras from two utility poles near the refuge.) 

A. With count four, we were split for a good while and it didn’t look like we could agree. Because this law requires us to consider intent, one of the jurors pressed hard on the issue of what Medenbach was thinking (adverse possession: he believed it was no longer a refuge truck). The video/audio evidence of his arrest was instructive, confirming a mindset. Some jurors were impressed by the surprise Medenbach expressed to the state police officer when told that the rig was reported as stolen. Another said if he had been caught with it while not doing ‘resource center’ business, so to speak, then it would have demonstrated his intent was not consistent with the claim. Eventually, none of us could imagine he was not going to return the vehicle to the refuge. 
Count five plagued us most of the day. We had to table the discussion a couple times because the contentions over the wording of the law as it relates to ‘knowingly stole’ proved to be a major hang up for one juror. There were many different definitions of ‘stole’ at play in the minds of several jurors. In the morning, 11 out of 12 were prepared to vote guilty, but after simmering and revisiting the debate a few times, the number of votes for not guilty grew to three. A couple of jurors came to believe that having the media present, offering back the cameras to the F.B.I., and taking steps to safeguard them after removal was proof of something other than theft. The majority could not deny that the intent to deprive was clearly present in Ryan. Since we were moving the opposite way of consensus and three jurors were resolved to vote not guilty, we agreed to end deliberations. 
Q. What did you and others think of Ammon Bundy’s testimony? 
A. It was clear that there was no juror who received Ammon’s testimony as fully honest, and several who felt manipulated. Even those who felt he was sincere in his beliefs found examples of inconsistency in his testimony. 
The continual objections to Ammon’s answers (usually owing to his own misleading phrasing that was disallowed) became tedious to myself, especially since altering one word would make the answer acceptable (and often did). The emotional appeals riddled throughout, while understandable as a tactic, also became tiresome to me since our feelings as jurors are irrelevant after all. And I don’t think it was endearing to us jurors for him to characterize the entire federal court system, of which we were a key part of, as rigged against himself. 
A few outstanding things Ammon testified to stood out to me. There apparently were multiple attempts to meet personally with the F.B.I. by Ammon and yet no face-to-face meet up ever occurred, presumably because the bureau did not wish to have that sort of negotiation. And the lack of law enforcement/engagement throughout the occupation, coupled with the visits to the refuge by many politicians, caused me to see how occupiers could view their presence as something other than illegal. Also, after watching an edited version of KATU’s Steve Dunn interview with Ammon at the refuge (this was played for the jury by Ammon Bundy’s lawyer ), there seemed to be consistency of message/belief that I did not expect — especially if you have 9 months to ponder your defense, even I might alter my emphasis or eliminate something unfavorable. Because of the law’s wording, Ammon’s state of mind weighed heavily. 

Q. Why do you wish to remain anonymous? 
A: Because I’d rather not encounter any of the angry commenters on your articles, I prefer to remain simply as Juror 4. I read on twitter that Matt Schindler (one of the defense attorneys) is receiving threats, which is very troubling to me.

20085,20085,Tesla Has Something Hotter Than Cars to Sell: Its Story - The New York Times,James B. Stewart,"As Tesla shares surged past $300 this week and the company’s market value surpassed Ford’s, even its founder, Elon Musk, acknowledged on Twitter that the company was “absurdly overvalued if based on the past. ” By “the past,” he presumably means   valuation measures like    or    ratios, the traditional benchmarks for evaluating stock prices. By those measures, Tesla  —   a company that lost $773 million last year  —   is indeed off the charts. Tesla’s market value of nearly $49 billion is not only higher than that of Ford, which earned nearly $11 billion in profit last year, but is within easy striking distance of General Motors, which earned $9. 4 billion. In contrast to Tesla, Ford and G. M. shares have dropped recently on fears that auto sales have hit a cyclical peak. Ford and G. M. executives wouldn’t comment on Tesla’s stock surge, but it’s easy to imagine they’d be tearing their hair out in frustration. “It’s nuts,” Bruce Greenwald, a professor at Columbia Business School and an expert in value investing, said of Tesla’s stock price. “Investors believe it’s going to dominate a market that no company has ever dominated before. ” But Tesla is not a stock, or a company, that is measured by the past, as Mr. Musk is well aware. He also wrote on Twitter that stock prices represent “  future cash flows”  —   and Tesla is about nothing if not a utopian future of safe, reliable, powerful,   electric vehicles powered by   batteries that are easy on the environment. In that regard, Tesla has ascended into a rarefied realm of   story stocks  —   companies that have so bewitched investors that their stock prices are impervious to any traditional valuation measures because their stories are simply too good not to be true. And to the dismay of   who believe they have ample rational reasons to bet against such stocks, their share prices can stay in the stratosphere for years, even decades. These story stocks  —   the term was coined by James Montier, a value investor and a member of the asset allocation team at the investment management firm GMO  —   are relatively rare, but hardly new. Amazon’s stock surged for decades even without any meaningful profits. A more recent example is Snapchat’s parent, Snap, which is racking up large losses while its stock trades at an astronomical    ratio of nearly 50, far higher than Tesla’s 7. (Ford’s, by comparison, is 0. 3.) Amazon and Snap both have stories that are compelling for many investors: Amazon has transformed retailing and is destined to dominate it. Snap is reinventing communication, at least for millennials and those even younger. Early investors in Uber and Airbnb, though they remain private companies, have valued them at stratospheric multiples based largely on the notion that Uber will transform and dominate local transportation and Airbnb will revolutionize the hotel industry. For story stocks, any development that lends credence to the story can cause a surge in already high valuations. This week Tesla reported quarterly sales that were modestly above expectations, and the stock surged 7 percent in a day. Tesla shares are up nearly 40 percent this year, even though many investors considered them overvalued in January. Ron Baron, the billionaire investor and founder of Baron Capital, disclosed last year that he owned about 1. 6 million Tesla shares. He predicted on CNBC in February that Tesla shares would quadruple by 2020 and triple again by 2025. By then he expects Tesla to become the largest company in the world as measured by market capitalization. For all the excitement and promise surrounding such companies, there are many cautionary tales. “Stories are great before bed, but are disastrous as a   technique,” Mr. Montier wrote in his 2009 book “Value Investing: Tools and Techniques for Intelligent Investment. ” If something is expensive based on traditional valuation metrics, he said, “you had better believe its story, as that is all you have. ” (A Tesla spokeswoman said Mr. Musk could not be reached for comment.) Various studies have shown that stocks with high    ratios, on average, significantly underperform market averages. For every Tesla or Uber, there’s a Valeant Pharmaceuticals or Theranos  —   two story stocks that seduced an astounding array of prominent investors and supporters based on stories that did turn out to be too good to be true. And while many investors’ memories tend to be short, the     bubble in the late 1990s spawned scores of story stocks, nearly all of them now worthless and forgotten. Still, Mr. Montier acknowledged, “Stories are compelling. ” They appeal to intuition rather than reason. “But perhaps investors would be well advised to follow Odysseus’s example of putting beeswax in his crew’s ears and tying himself to the mast in order to avoid the disastrous, but oh so desirable, call of the Siren song. ” Will Tesla be one of the rare exceptions and, as Mr. Baron has predicted, emerge as the world’s most valuable company? The company has won over many skeptics with its   execution, so far, and the high quality of its vehicles and high levels of consumer satisfaction. It is no longer a  : It delivered 25, 000 vehicles in the last quarter. It is on track to achieve economies of scale, and the company says the gross margin on each vehicle is above 20 percent, far higher than the industry average. That could drive enormous future profits. But that’s not the Tesla story  —   or stories  —   investors are betting on. Adam Jonas, a Morgan Stanley automotive analyst who is hardly a   optimist about the industry, upgraded Tesla shares to overweight in January. He singles out the company’s new autonomous driving technology as a compelling safety feature that will significantly reduce occupant and pedestrian injuries and fatalities. This week he said he expected “vehicle safety to be the primary differentiator in Tesla’s upcoming product offensive,” referring to the eagerly anticipated introduction of Tesla’s new,   Model 3, which will be equipped with the new technology. That Tesla is an   environmentally friendly,   vehicle  —   the story that once excited investors  —   is barely mentioned anymore. Even more futuristic is the idea that Tesla cars will be entirely   able to cruise streets nearly full time (except when they are being charged at Tesla’s     stations). In this vision, Tesla owners will share their vehicles with Tesla when not using them, and during that time they will ferry other passengers, serving as Tesla’s version of Uber. Thus Tesla will disrupt Uber’s nascent market dominance. And Tesla is no longer seen just as a vehicle manufacturer. With its solar and battery technologies, it is in a position to dominate two other enormous industry segments. Tesla “is reinventing the electric grid,” as Mr. Baron said on CNBC. “That’s a bigger opportunity than cars. ” Even if all that comes to pass, it may not be enough to justify Tesla’s valuation unless it can sustain a competitive advantage over time, as Mr. Greenwald, the value investing expert, put it. Tesla is spending heavily on research and development, and perhaps its technology will be difficult or impossible for others to replicate. The established automakers have had years to catch up to or overtake Tesla’s Model S, with a conspicuous lack of success. But for committed value investors, the writing is on the wall: “Is Tesla going to dominate its industry? That’s the key question,” Mr. Greenwald said. “When it comes to the global auto industry, no one ever has, and in all likelihood, no one ever will. ”",0
20086,20086,"Dr. Denton Cooley, Whose Pioneering Heart Surgery Set Off a 40-Year Medical Feud, Dies at 96 - The New York Times",Lawrence K. Altman,"Dr. Denton A. Cooley, the renowned surgeon who was the first to implant a totally artificial heart in a patient and in the process set off one of medicine’s greatest feuds, died on Friday at his home in Houston. He was 96. The Texas Heart Institute, which Dr. Cooley founded, confirmed his death. He stopped performing surgery on his 87th birthday but had never retired, remaining active at the institute as its president emeritus. The institute said he last showed up there on Monday. A former college basketball star who was a towering presence in the operating room, Dr. Cooley had by age 50 performed more than 5, 000 cardiac operations, including 17 heart transplants. For more than six decades his name was inextricably linked to that of his mentor and former partner, Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, the developer of the artificial heart. Their pioneering techniques for surgery on the heart and blood vessels have helped tens of thousands of patients. But those advances were overshadowed on April 4, 1969, when Dr. Cooley, working independently of Dr. DeBakey, performed his groundbreaking implantation without Dr. DeBakey’s authorization. At the time, Dr. DeBakey and a medical team were developing the artificial heart  —   it was still an experimental device  —   at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Dr. DeBakey felt betrayed. Suddenly his protégé was his archrival. So began a feud that would last 40 years, reveal much about the personalities and ambitions of the two renowned surgeons and end only a year before Dr. DeBakey’s death in 2008. Dr. Cooley long defended his action as a doctor’s obligation to do whatever is necessary to save a patient’s life. “If you are a ship out in the ocean and someone throws you a life preserver, you don’t look at it to see if it has been approved by the federal government,” he said in an interview for this obituary. The implantation was performed at the Texas Heart Institute the patient was Haskell Karp, 47, from Skokie, Ill. About 16 months earlier, Dr. Christiaan N. Barnard had performed the world’s first human heart transplant in South Africa, a milestone that led many other surgeons to try the operation. One was Dr. Cooley, a professor of surgery at Baylor and the chief of cardiovascular surgery at St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital in Houston, who in 1968 performed what he claimed was the first successful heart transplant in the United States. The rush to transplantation led researchers like Dr. DeBakey to renew their attempts to develop an artificial heart to keep patients alive until a donor heart could be found. He was believed to be the first to perform surgery using a partial artificial heart, known as a ventricular assist device. Dr. DeBakey, who had led a campaign to persuade the federal government to support such research, had been developing his artificial heart with a colleague, Dr. Domingo S. Liotta of Argentina, under a grant from the National Institutes of Health. Dr. DeBakey believed the device, which had been tested only on calves, was not ready to be tried on a human patient. But Mr. Karp’s failing heart could not pump enough blood. When efforts to repair it failed, Dr. Cooley enlisted Dr. Liotta to deliver the artificial heart from Dr. DeBakey’s laboratory and, with a   medical team in a   operation, removed Mr. Karp’s heart and implanted the artificial one, a   device made of plastic and Dacron connected by tubes to a bedside control console. The device worked for 64 hours, longer than it had in animal tests, while a frantic search began for a donor heart. When one was found, Dr. Cooley performed the operation. The new heart sustained Mr. Karp for another 32 hours, until he died of pneumonia. (The first totally artificial heart intended for permanent use, the Jarvik 7, was implanted in Dr. Barney B. Clark at the University of Utah in 1982. He survived for 112 days. Since then, the federal government has approved the use of partial artificial hearts.) Dr. DeBakey, who was Baylor’s chancellor, accused Dr. Cooley of committing an unethical and “childish” act to claim a medical first. He contended further that in using a device that was still under development, he had broken federal rules and jeopardized Baylor’s federal research support. Dr. Cooley said that use of the device to save a patient’s life, even experimentally, did not violate the grant contract. He later maintained the operation was also an act of patriotism: He did not want the Russians to be the first to implant a total artificial heart and beat the United States as they had with their early space program. Dr. Cooley resigned from Baylor, and the American College of Surgeons censured him for his unauthorized use of the device, which is now in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. For decades after that, Dr. Cooley and Dr. DeBakey rarely spoke to each other or were even in the same room. (The feud became so intense and so widely talked about that it became the subject of a cover story in Life magazine.) “Once Mike and I became rivals,” Dr. Cooley said, “he seemed to go out of the way to establish the fact that it was he who was responsible for all of the developments” in heart surgery techniques, many of which he and other members of Dr. DeBakey’s staff had performed. The two reconciled in October 2007, two years after Dr. DeBakey had recovered from an operation at age 97. In a ceremony at St. Luke’s, Dr. DeBakey accepted a lifetime achievement award from the Denton A. Cooley Cardiovascular Surgical Society. After presenting the award, Dr. Cooley stepped down from the stage and knelt next to Dr. DeBakey, who sat in a motorized scooter. The two shook hands warmly. Dr. Cooley had sought the reconciliation for years. “Because I owe a real debt to the people who have helped me in my career,” he said, “I would have been somewhat derelict if I had not had the chance to tell Mike DeBakey that. ” Denton Arthur Cooley was born in Houston on Aug. 22, 1920, to a wealthy family. His paternal grandfather, Daniel Denton Cooley, was a founder of the planned community Houston Heights. His father, Ralph, was a prominent dentist. Dr. Cooley attributed his surgical skills to his athletic prowess. As a freshman at the University of Texas, he was told by his basketball coach to add at least 25 pounds to his    frame to avoid “getting murdered” on the court. He gained even more weight and went on to play forward and center for the team. A member of Phi Beta Kappa, he graduated in 1941 with a degree in zoology. He was attracted to surgery at age 17 when he visited an emergency room in San Antonio and observed a friend sewing up knife wounds inflicted in Saturday night brawls. After starting medical school in Galveston, he transferred to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, earning a medical degree in 1944. After serving in World War II and then continuing his training on a fellowship in England, where he studied with the heart surgeon Russell C. Brock, Dr. Cooley returned to Houston to work under Dr. DeBakey. Over the next few years, the two surgeons had important roles in virtually every major development in heart and   surgery. Dr. DeBakey and Dr. Cooley devised operations to repair potentially fatal bulges in aortas and to bypass arteriosclerotic damage in neck and leg arteries that could lead to strokes. Dr. Cooley also came up with a way to reduce the amount of transfused blood used in the   machine that “breathes” for the patient during   operations. The technique reduced the incidence of infections like hepatitis B at a time when no vaccine existed to prevent that debilitating and potentially fatal liver infection. It also made it easier to perform surgery on patients whose religious beliefs prevented them from receiving another person’s blood. Dr. Cooley said that “if there is any contribution I should be recognized for,” it is reducing the need for blood transfusions in   operations. Dr. Cooley, who believed that the outcome of an operation was related to its length, became an exceptionally fast surgeon despite athletic injuries that damaged a few fingers and a wrist. “I was always surprised how seemingly slow all his movements were in operating,” Dr. Roland Hetzer, a onetime colleague and former director of the German Heart Institute in Berlin, said in an interview there in 2010. “But every stitch was just perfect the first time, and he never had to do something a second time. So in the end he was very fast, a very good technical surgeon. ” In 1962, Dr. Cooley founded the Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke’s and became its president. He also taught at the University of Texas and Baylor medical schools in Houston. He worked in an era when federal regulation of the development of new medical and surgical devices was limited. Doctors could make their own devices and instruments and use them on patients with little outside oversight. Human experimentation committees, whose approval is needed before doctors can conduct an experiment on a patient, did not yet exist. “All the progress we made in that period would take us a century now,” Dr. Cooley said. “We would just try something in the lab, have some personal conviction that it was a meaningful thing to do and try, and then we would go ahead and apply it. ” At his peak, Dr. Cooley was said to be the busiest heart surgeon in the United States, performing many operations a day using an   approach. Patients were assigned to separate operating rooms where younger doctors opened their chests and exposed the hearts. Dr. Cooley then scurried between operating rooms to do the crucial part of each operation. Some of his critics have questioned the quality of the surgery. “My athletic experiences taught me endurance and competitiveness, with perhaps an emphasis on endurance,” he said. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan presented Dr. Cooley with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian award, for “charting new territory in his search for ways to prolong and enrich human life. ” Dr. Cooley had homes in Houston and in Galveston, Tex. His wife of 67 years, the Louise Thomas Cooley, died before him, as did a daughter, Florence Talbot Cooley. His survivors include four other daughters, Mary Cooley Craddock, Dr. Susan Cooley, Dr. Louise Cooley Davis and Helen Cooley Fraser 16 grandchildren and 17  . Dr. Cooley had his failures, both professional (a    experimental heart transplant was unsuccessful) and personal (he declared bankruptcy from failed real estate investments in the early 1980s). And though he and Dr. DeBakey reconciled, their rivalry never completely abated. Dr. DeBakey has been called the greatest surgeon ever. Before his death in 2008, he said in an interview that Dr. Cooley was “one of the best cardiovascular surgeons” he had ever known. Asked in a separate interview whom he considered the greatest surgeon, Dr. Cooley replied, “Besides myself?”",0
20087,20087,"Academy Awards, James Comey: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",Karen Zraick and Sandra Stevenson,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump is quickly dismantling   policies. He revived two blocked pipeline projects: the Keystone XL pipeline, the focus of years of debate over energy needs and climate change and the Dakota Access pipeline, the target of intense Native American protests. Mr. Trump also pressed automakers to increase jobs in the U. S. But a new forecast of a federal budget deficit that could expand to almost $10 trillion over 10 years could complicate his agenda to slash taxes and ramp up spending. And the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood by Mr. Trump’s repetition of the false claim that only millions of illegal votes by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. _____  2. On Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump’s pick to be secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company. And James Comey, above, told top agents that he’d been asked to remain as head of the F. B. I. averting another potentially bruising confirmation battle. It’s a delicate time for the intelligence community, which is looking into ties between Mr. Trump’s associates  —   including his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort  —   and Russia. Mr. Trump said he’d name his Supreme Court pick next week. The top contenders are conservatives on federal appeals courts: William Pryor Jr. known for his opposition to abortion and gay rights, and Neil Gorsuch, more distinguished by credentials, erudition and relatively muted stances. _____ 3. This year’s Oscar nominations are out. Voters gave “La La Land” 14 nominations, a tie for the most in Academy Award history. The academy also honored six black actors  —   a record. They included Denzel Washington and Viola Davis for their roles in “Fences,” above. Here is the full list of nominees our critics’ rundown of surprises and snubs reactions from some of the nominees a form to complete your own ballot and a guide on how to stream the nominated movies. _____ 4. Israel, discarding diplomatic restraint just a few days into the Trump administration, approved the construction of 2, 500 housing units in West Bank settlements. A month ago, the Obama administration declined to veto a Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlements as a “flagrant violation of international law,” and a week ago, a gathering of world leaders warned Israel to stop expanding them. _____ 5. Two days of talks in Kazakhstan on the Syrian war concluded with an agreement by Iran, Russia and Turkey to enforce a partial  . But they didn’t say how, and none of the Syrians at the conference  —   neither the government, nor the rebels, above  —   signed the agreement, and the main result was solidifying Russia’s role in the diplomacy. _____ 6. The Manhattan jail holding the notorious drug lord known as El Chapo is said to be tougher than Guantánamo. A remarkable figure in the annals of crime history, with two escapes from   Mexican prisons, he was extradited to the U. S. last week. The lights are on almost 24 hours a day, security is extraordinarily stringent, and the most closely guarded prisoners are denied almost all human contact. But it has seen several successful escapes. _____ 7. The expensive wonder drugs approved in recent years to cure hepatitis C, which can lead to liver disease and cancer, offered the hope of resolving a huge public health problem in the U. S. and around the world. But a report coming out Wednesday warns of the possibility of serious side effects, including liver failure, and doctors said the issue warranted further study. The news set off a new round of debate over the risks of expedited approval for badly needed drugs. “Benefits and side effects evolve over the long term, not over 12 weeks,” an author of the study said. _____ 8. Burning dinner might seem like a mistake. But the art of strategic charring, browning and blackening has deep roots in many cuisines. Exercised with care, it can conjure a world of flavor. Chefs are embracing the technique. Consider moles made with charred and   ingredients, above, blackened avocado and, mmm, lamb heart ashes. _____ 9. Houston is preparing to welcome the Super Bowl on Feb. 5, and its leaders are eager to show off the makeover the city has undergone since it last hosted the game more than a decade ago. A hub for the oil and gas industries and the nation’s   city, Houston is on the upswing, boasting an array of new restaurants,   green space, and cultural and entertainment venues. _____ 10. On the move? Our travel writer reviewed several meditation apps that have sessions for use on planes, trains  —   even your daily commute. One is called “OMG. I Can Meditate!” Another offers the affirming reminder: “The more our mind learns about itself, the stronger it becomes. ” As we’ve said before about mindfulness exercises: Hey, it can’t hurt. _____ 11. Finally, there are many ways to look at history. We’re gauging it through antique lace: our 165 years of wedding reporting. The project’s first installment focuses on the subjects of The Times’s first wedding announcement, on Sept. 18, 1851, Sarah Mullett and John Grant. And, amazingly, generations of their descendants, who gather every year for a family photo with the ancestral portraits. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

Central Italy was struck twice in quick succession the previous day, with the first tremor hitting it at around 19:11 local time (17:11 GMT). The quake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale and could be felt as far as Rome some 240 km (149 miles). Shortly after a second quake of 6.1-magnitude, struck at around 21:18 local time (19:18 GMT). Buildings were shaking, some parts even caving in, and residents fled into the street to save themselves.

20089,20089,"For Trump’s Nominees, a Billionaires’ Guide to Running the Government - The New York Times",Charles Duhigg,"Pity the poor billionaires who are about to take the oath of office. For them, everything is going to change. In winning the presidency, Donald J. Trump proposed a grand hypothesis: that the federal government can be managed like a business. “If we could run our country the way I’ve run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of,” he told voters in the final presidential debate. It’s a theory that has been suggested, to various degrees, by almost every president in the last century, from Calvin Coolidge to Barack Obama. What’s different this time is the vigorousness of the experiment. With his inauguration on Friday, and a cabinet that is likely to include three billionaires, five former chief executives and some of the business world’s most accomplished leaders, Mr. Trump is poised to test, perhaps once and for all, if good governance and crafty deal making are really similar skills. But, as anyone who has spent time in a laboratory can attest, experiments are messy. Separating the signals from the noise takes diligence. And in this case, so much will depend on the savviness of those woeful billionaires who had it so good, and now will be guinea pigs thrust into a maze that has overwhelmed so many test subjects before them. “Running an agency is very, very different from running a company,” said Carlos M. Gutierrez, who was commerce secretary under George W. Bush after serving as chief executive of Kellogg’s. “Some of the skills do transfer, but you have to be careful figuring out which ones. In government, you can’t fire anyone. Your board of directors is 535 people in Congress, and half of them want to see you fail. ” One of the first challenges will be figuring out what “business leadership” means when so many of capitalism’s tools  —   firing misbehaving employees giving raises to those who overperform  —   aren’t allowed by federal rules. “C. E. O.s who come in saying, ‘I’m going to show everyone how it’s done,’ are the ones most likely to fail,” Mr. Gutierrez said. One problem has always been that while the business world rewards leaders for an intense focus on a singular goal  —   maximizing profits as efficiently as possible  —   government yearns for the opposite: pleasing the largest number of people with methods that offend the fewest. And while competition is usually a good thing within business, inside government, it’s often more corrosive, as the partisanship of the past decade demonstrates. “You succeed in Washington by collaborating,” said Henry M. Paulson Jr. who was widely lauded as Treasury secretary for Mr. Bush and, before that, as chief executive of Goldman Sachs. Businesspeople tend to see competition as a means to find the best solutions, a sorting device that pushes the smartest ideas ahead. But many of the trickiest government issues, like immigration or tax reform, involve dozens of agencies, as well as lawmakers and lobbyists, who must be persuaded to cooperate. Intelligence in government is almost always a humble, group activity. “You can’t just think about your own agency, or your own goals,” Mr. Paulson said. “You have to please both sides of the aisle, while making sure you’re not outshining other officials, and persuading employees who don’t have to obey your orders. And you have to adjust to having a boss, the president, instead of being the boss. It takes a lot of humility. ” Some of Mr. Trump’s picks might have an easier time making the transition than others. Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil and the choice for secretary of state, is among the nominees who have spent their careers involved in the    operations of complicated firms that span continents. “Tillerson has basically been a politician for the last 20 years he’s just been doing it for the nation of Exxon,” said Paul H. O’Neill, who became Treasury secretary during Mr. Bush’s first term after leading the aluminum company Alcoa. “He’s negotiated with foreign governments, he’s had more than 80, 000 employees. You don’t run a company that size by telling people what to do. You learn how to persuade them to follow your vision, to accommodate all kinds of different agendas and personalities. ” Other cabinet secretaries have spent their careers mostly as investors, not as direct managers. Hedge fund and private equity professionals like Steven T. Mnuchin, likely to be the next Treasury secretary Betsy DeVos, who has been tapped as education secretary and Wilbur L. Ross, the expected commerce secretary, have largely devoted their lives to buying and selling companies. And so there are questions about how well they will make the shift to jobs that demand a    focus on the smallest details of governance. Mr. Ross, whose confirmation hearing was held on Wednesday, presents a fascinating test subject. As an acquirer of steel mills, coal mines and other heavy industries, he has amassed a personal fortune worth billions. “Over the years, I’ve had businesses that actually operated in some 23 countries,” Mr. Ross said at the hearing. “We have been on the ground in all of the major trading partners of this country. ” Usually, when Mr. Ross buys a new company, he follows a pretty successful script: He shows up, says a few words and then hands operations to professional managers who know how to run things  —   and who know he will fire them if they fail. However, when Mr. Ross takes the oath of office, that script will change. He will be whisked off to the executive wing of the Commerce Department and walked past long rows of barren offices. (The furniture of political appointees is removed during each presidential transition, and  —   spoiler alert  —   it often takes weeks for new desks and bookcases to arrive.) If he can find enough chairs, he might call a meeting of the few employees milling around (his deputies and key department heads need senatorial approval, which might take a few months). He will be handed dozens of binders explaining how his department does everything from monitor weather satellites to administer patents, and admonished to study up. (Congress loves humiliating cabinet members who haven’t done their homework, and explaining that you are an excellent delegator, alas, fails to impress on Capitol Hill.) If Mr. Ross hopes to fly to one of the department’s satellite offices, he will have to decide if he wants to complete the reams of paperwork needed to use his own jet, or go coach, as secretaries in previous administrations were encouraged. “Perception matters a lot in Washington,” said Karen G. Mills, who always flew in the cheap seats as administrator of the Small Business Administration after a career in finance left her with more than $40 million. “I did, however, try to avoid the middle seat. ” If Mr. Ross is lucky, by the end of his first day, someone will have shown him where the bathrooms are. There’s a risk, however, that the agency’s permanent staff’s “No. 1 goal will be to find ways to sabotage each new cabinet secretary as soon as they walk through the door,” said Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker who was a campaign adviser to Mr. Trump. “All those bureaucrats overwhelmingly voted for Clinton. There won’t be any real cooperation until we change federal law so we can fire them. ” Worst of all, though, is that at the end of his tenure, no matter how hard Mr. Ross works or how much he sacrifices, a large part of his success  —   as well as that of the other secretaries and this experiment as a whole  —   will be outside his control. Ultimately, the most important variable in testing this hypothesis will be Mr. Trump himself. What kind of management style will he adopt? Will he be an operator or a delegator? Will he change as president, or simply relocate and remain C. E. O. in chief? How a president behaves filters into the cabinet, and senior officials, no matter how talented or powerful they once were, become an appendage of their new boss  —   a hard demotion for any former master of the universe. If Mr. Trump can’t manage the presidency, then no one working for him is likely to succeed. And vice versa. So as this experiment unfolds before a captivated nation, pity Mr. Ross and all the poor billionaires. They are sacrificing themselves so that all of us might learn. And, in case they are wondering: The bathrooms are down the hall and around the corner. You’re responsible for replacing the toilet paper if you’ve used the last of the roll.",0

20091,20091,"Rockefeller Foundation Picks Rajiv J. Shah, a Trustee, as President - The New York Times",David Gelles,"Rajiv J. Shah, a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation, was asked about six months ago to join the committee that would select the foundation’s next president. He said no. Instead, Mr. Shah, who until recently had been the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, ultimately said he wanted to be considered for the post. He got the job. On Thursday, the Rockefeller Foundation, one of the country’s largest and most influential philanthropies, will name Mr. Shah to succeed Judith Rodin, who has been president for 12 years. The appointment will make Mr. Shah one of the most powerful forces in charitable giving, overseeing a foundation that donates roughly $200 million each year and corrals governments, companies and organizations to contribute money and resources in tandem. Mr. Shah, 43, will be the first   to lead the Rockefeller Foundation, which has gained stature in recent years through some prominent projects but has sometimes been criticized as being more interested in its publicity than its grantees. Founded in 1913 by the oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, the foundation says it has given away the equivalent of more than $17 billion in today’s dollars. Its first grant was to the American Red Cross, and it went on to play pivotal roles in establishing the field of public health, creating vaccines for yellow fever and malaria, and bringing agricultural advances to the developing world. In recent years, the foundation has focused on the themes of “resilience” and “inclusive economies. ” That has resulted in programs aimed at establishing “resilience officers” in 100 cities to focus on disaster relief and a plan that is sending 100, 000   students to see the musical “Hamilton. ” These efforts have struck critics as public relations stunts more than meaningful agents of change. And Ms. Rodin has drawn fire for spending too much time with corporate partners and not enough time with the recipients of grants. Much of the foundation’s work concerns improving health and   in Africa, aiding economic development in impoverished areas and developing strategies to combat climate change. It was these diverse causes that attracted Mr. Shah to the job. With advanced degrees in medicine and health finance from the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Shah worked at the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation for nearly a decade, rising to be director for agricultural development. From 2009 to 2015, he ran U. S. A. I. D. leading the response to disasters including the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. After leaving the agency, he founded Latitude Capital, a private equity firm focused on emerging markets. In those roles, Mr. Shah said, he came to understand the power of   partnerships, a strategy that Ms. Rodin has embraced at the Rockefeller Foundation. “I’ve seen what’s possible when people come together,” he said in an interview this week. “We were able to save tens of thousands, if not millions, of lives. ” Ms. Rodin was not involved in the search for her successor but has known Mr. Shah for years. They worked together on an agricultural project when he was at the Gates Foundation, and he joined the Rockefeller Foundation board in 2015. “He’s a marvel,” Ms. Rodin said in an interview this week. “He’s very strategic and very innovative. He shows an interpersonal dexterity that is well beyond his years. ” Ms. Rodin said she believed that Mr. Shah was a good fit for the job thanks in part to his time at U. S. A. I. D. which required that he forge alliances with a vast array of governments, organizations and companies. “One of the things we tried to emphasize during my time at Rockefeller was broadening the scope of partnerships,” Ms. Rodin said. “We see in Raj someone who has the capacity to take advantage of this, and has the capacity to be a great partner. ” Richard Parsons, the chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation board, said Mr. Shah was the unanimous choice of the search committee after a competitive process that considered hundreds of candidates. “Raj is the perfect guy to come in after her,” Mr. Parsons said in an interview. “He’s a performer. You put him up in front of a group and people come away impressed. Now, he’s got a platform. ” Mr. Shah said he was committed to the broad themes of resilience and inclusive economies. “That core concept of resilience is extraordinarily important going forward,” he said. “It gives us the opportunity to evolve into the future. ” But he said he would look for opportunities to address schisms in the American electorate in this divisive political moment. “It is a different time today than it was 10 or 15 years ago,” he said. “We live in a more fractured world. ” The Rockefeller Foundation is viewed by some has having a liberal bent. During Ms. Rodin’s tenure, the foundation donated money to the Clinton Foundation. Mr. Shah is close with President Obama but said he maintained good relations with Republicans in the House and Senate and believed that the foundation’s core mission had bipartisan appeal. “It’s widely acknowledged that tackling hunger and ensuring health around the globe are in our own national interest,” Mr. Shah said. “I have always been passionate about delivering social justice results at a massive scale. ” He will now have a $200 million a year to try to deliver those results.",0

Why does everyone think that presidential campaigns are about “issues,” when anyone over the age of consent knows they are all about sex? But it says a lot about the lasting power of Viagra that this is still the case when we have a couple of seventy-year-olds on the ballot. (“ For an election lasting more than four years, please call your doctor .”) 
In last week’s newspaper there was a report on the tenth or eleventh woman (I have lost track) to come forward to say that Donald Trump made suggestive and “inappropriate” advances to her during a golf tournament that took place about ten years ago. 
The woman in question is Jessica Drake, who during her press conference announced that at the time of the tournament, she was working in the “the adult industry” (that’s what People Magazine calls porn) for Wicked Pictures (the 20th Century Fox of gang banging) when the randy Donald kissed and hugged her in his room. 
Trump was already in his pajamas when she knocked on his door, together with two friends. Normally, in the adult business, when three porn stars knock on your hotel door, it’s considered foreplay. 
When Trump’s effusive greeting of Miss Drake did not lead to more snuggling, let alone the suggestion to preview some of her work on the hotel television, he offered her $10,000 to satisfy his suite dreams. 
Drake again demurred, saying that the next morning she needed to get back to Los Angeles “for work.” By that point in her career she had…",1
20096,20096,Aetna CEO on Obamacare: Young People Will Choose Beer First | Politics,beforeitsnews.com,"(Before It's News)
Remember when the media, Barack Obama, and Democrats were finger-wagging and tut-tutting Republicans for saying Obamacare was going to be a failure? Remember how Obama said premiums were going to go down?
For the last 18 months, Obama and his fellow Democrats have been reduced to bragging about how many people are now “covered” by health insurance as if it was some real accomplishment. Two points to consider:
It is mandatory. People are merely obeying the law and getting a plan. The law’s intention was for healthcare coverage to be more affordable, and that has not happened. Insurers are recognizing this problem. Younger people would rather be in a position where they pay the fine (which the administration is not enforcing), rather than the out of pocket costs for a health care plan. The CEO of Aetna said as much:
Healthier people will avoid buying Affordable Care Act health insurance plans as premiums climb, threatening the stability of the market, Aetna Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said.
“As the rates rise, the healthier people pull out because the out-of-pocket costs aren’t worth it,” Bertolini said at Bloomberg’s The Year Ahead Summit in New York. “Young people can do the math. Gas for the car, beer on Fridays and Saturdays, health insurance.”
Premiums for health plans sold to individuals under the ACA, known as Obamacare, are going up by about 25 percent on average for next year. Bertolini said that as costs rise, more individuals will decide not to buy health plans. That’ll push premiums even higher, unless a new president and lawmakers can find fixes for the new markets created by the 2010 health law.
The question over whether such problems get fixed is all dependent upon whether or no the President, be it Obama or Clinton, recognizes what divided government means. It is not to say, as President Obama believes, “Here is what I need, now pass it so I can sign it.” President Obama or President Clinton must recognize divided government means everything is on the table at the start of negotiations , not just what the President wants.

20097,20097,The Irresistible Style of Emma Stone - The New York Times,Bee Shapiro,"Few actresses are more likable than Emma Stone. She is spunky, talented,   and slightly goofy. But unlike some approachable actresses, who stick with the pretty if bland aesthetic, Ms. Stone is as soignée as they come. “She’s very spirited when it comes to fashion,” said Petra Flannery, her stylist for the past decade. “She’s a very animated person, and my goal is to make the clothes complement all of that, whether it’s through color, or a material that makes it unique, or an interesting design. ” It helps that like the variety of characters she inhabits  —   Ms. Stone is nominated for an Oscar in the best actress category for the   musical film “La La Land”  —   she has range. She comes alive in marigold (a flirty,   Gucci creation at a W magazine party last month, which Ms. Flannery called “the ultimate party dress”) sky blue (a   Prada dress at the Los Angeles “La La Land” premiere in December) and even pale sea foam (a shimmering Atelier Versace gown at the Venice Film Festival in September, which seemed to have gone through a very expensive shredder). Strange proportions are also fair game. At the EE British Academy Film Awards, familiarly known as the Baftas, this month, Ms. Stone managed to make a   embroidered smoke gray organza dress over    pants (Chanel haute couture, mind you) seem like kismet. “The look was so cool because of the pants, but also it was a little Lucille Ball because of the ’50s shape of the dress,” Ms. Flannery said. It was not the first time Ms. Stone carried off a tricky Chanel design  —   or pants on the red carpet, for that matter. While an ornate embroidered jacket and a heavy silver and gold column skirt, both in tweed, might have sapped the youth out of some, Ms. Stone was a sophisticated jeune fille in the Chanel Métiers d’Art outfit she wore to the Paris premiere of “La La Land. ” Yet Ms. Stone doesn’t overdose on opulence. Like a palate cleanser, the actress peppered her red carpet look with minimal slip dresses (a rich burgundy number by the Row for the London premiere of “La La Land” in January and a strappy black Stella McCartney design at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival this month). Another Stella McCartney, a midnight blue jumpsuit worn to the Oscar Nominees Luncheon a few days later, was also relatively spare, though the puffed   cut had plenty of quirk. “I always want to keep it fresh and fun,” Ms. Flannery said. To that end, she works with a combination of custom and runway pieces. “I love doing custom, because it’s nice to know you’re really surprising people,” she said, pointing to the glittering   Valentino gown Ms. Stone wore to the Golden Globes last month. Sourcing directly from the runway used to be the gold standard, but, Ms. Flannery said, “it’s different today with social media. ” “Instagram images pop up all over,” she continued, “and by the time a dress comes from the runway, it can feel like you’ve seen it already. ” Luckily, Ms. Flannery has such access  —   Ms. Stone, after all, is a red carpet score for any designer  —   that she can nab a collection piece before it has ever left the studio. Such was the case when she secured the remarkable Alexander McQueen dress with lily pad embroidery that Ms. Stone wore to the Screen Actors Guild Awards in January. With asymmetrical draping and a lace bodice, the design was a visual feat: Ms. Stone looked as though she was partially undressed. Ms. Flannery said the gown was from the label’s 2017   collection, which “had not been viewed by anybody yet. ” She reserved the piece a couple of weeks before the awards ceremony as she was passing through London with Ms. Stone. “It’s true designers love her,” Ms. Flannery said, “but also Emma appreciates fashion from an artist’s point of view. Style is innate. It’s in her bones. ”",0
20098,20098,Former US Intelligence Chief Admits Obama Took “Willful Decision” to Support ISIS Rise,Mike Rivero,"Region: USA in the World If one was only to read mainstream news in the West, you would probably be inculcated with the myth that Islamic State (ISIS) appeared almost out of thin air and many governments in the Western world have been completely shocked by the rise of this terror group. Perhaps you would correctly blame the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq as a major reason why such extreme groups gained power in the region, in addition to blaming certain governments for supposedly marginalizing Sunni’s. But what most mainstream readers will be miserably ignorant of is the fact that one of the main opposition groups fighting the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria has been ISIS itself, a group that has been trained, funded, aided and armed by NATO countries in collusion with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Israel (to name a few). This reality has been completely omitted in numerous corporate media publications, once again demonstrating the inept and deceptive nature of mainstream news. Some Western news outlets are still peddling the fallacy that the Obama administration misjudged the threat of ISIS, and was taken by surprise by the groups rise. Obama himself claimed in 2014 when responding to a question asking whether the US underestimated ISIS: “That their advance, their movement, over the last several months has been more rapid than the intelligence estimates and I think the expectations of policy makers both inside and outside of Iraq.” This narrative runs in stark contrast to a recently declassified US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) document from 2012 which was released by Judicial Watch after the watchdog group filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit. The DIA document warned: “ISI [the Islamic State of Iraq] could also declare an Islamic State through its union with other terrorist organisations in Iraq and Syria.” ( p.5 ) In a recent interview with Mehdi Hasan of Al Jazeera, the former head of the DIA, Michael T. Flynn, reiterates that the Obama administration was warned about the potential of extreme groups gaining influence in the region but instead of halting the support for the Syrian opposition, the administration took the “wilful decision” to support the rebels anyway: Hasan (Interviewer) (From 11.15 onwards into the interview): “In 2012, your agency was saying, quote: “The Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Qaeda in Iraq [(which ISIS arose out of)], are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria.” In 2012, the US was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups. Why did you not stop that if you’re worried about the rise of Islamic extremism?” Flynn : “Well I hate to say it’s not my job, but… my job was to ensure that the accuracy of our intelligence that was being presented was as good as it could be, and I will tell you, it goes before 2012. When we were in Iraq, and we still had decisions to be made before there was a decision to pull out of Iraq in 2011, it was very clear what we were going to face.” Hasan (Interviewer): You are basically saying that even in government at the time, you knew those groups were around, you saw this analysis, and you were arguing against it, but who wasn’t listening?” Flynn : “I think the administration.” Hasan (Interviewer): “So the administration turned a blind eye to your analysis?” Flynn : “I don’t know if they turned a blind eye. I think it was a decision, a willful decision.” Hasan (Interviewer): “A wilful decision to support an insurgency that had Salafists, Al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood?” Flynn: “A wilful decision to do what they’re doing… You have to really ask the President what is it that he actually is doing with the policy that is in place, because it is very, very confusing.” It is quite obvious that NATO countries in conjunction with regional allies have been funding, arming and training an array of rebel bandits to overthrow the secular Syrian government for years now, although they have been unable to force regime change in Damascus so far. In the 2012 declassified report from the DIA, the document reveals that the powers supporting the Syrian opposition – “Western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey” – wanted to create a “Salafist principality in Eastern Syria in order to isolate the Syrian regime”: “Opposition forces are trying to control the Eastern areas (Hasaka and Der Zor), adjacent to the Western Iraqi provinces (Mosul and Anbar), in addition to neighbouring Turkish borders. Western countries, the Gulf states and Turkey are supporting these efforts… If the situation unravels there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist principality in Eastern Syria (Hasaka and Der Zor), and this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the Syrian regime, which is considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion (Iraq and Iran).” ( p.5 ) Shipping Weapons from Libya to the Syrian Rebels Numerous reports in 2012 alleged that the US was sending heavy weapons from the military stockpiles of the former Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, to the Syrian rebels. Another formerly classified document released by Judicial Watch from the US Department of Defense (DOD) reveals that the White House was at least aware of arms shipments from Libya to Syria, although the document does not disclose who was shipping the weapons: “Weapons from the former Libya military stockpiles were shipped from the port of Benghazi, Libya to the Port of Banias and the Port of Borj Islam, Syria. The weapons shipped during late-August 2012 were Sniper rifles, RPG’s, and 125 mm and 155mm howitzers missiles… The numbers for each weapon were estimated to be: 500 Sniper rifles, 100 RPG launchers with 300 total rounds, and approximately 400 howitzers missiles [200 ea – 125mm and 200ea – 155 mm.]” ( DOD Document ) This is all part of a long term strategy by the West to overthrow regimes that are not subservient to Western interests. NATO’s 2011 war in Libya has already forced regime change in the North African country, with the West still working on bringing down the Syrian regime. Both countries were listed as enemies of the US by the neoconservative thinktank, the Project for a New American Century (PNAC) in their 2000 report, long before the illegal 2011 war in Libya and the ongoing proxy war in Syria. Iraq, Iran and North Korea were also on PNAC’s hit list . Further illustrating the fact that many of the wars and proxy wars we have witnessed in recent years were premeditated operations by imperial powers, t he former French minister of Foreign Affairs, Roland Dumas, revealed that the war in Syria was “ prepared, preconceived and planned ” at least “two years before the violence” erupted. Dumas said he was approached in the UK by “top British officials” to see if he would participate in “organizing an invasion of rebels into Syria”, a proposal Dumas refused, but it is clear that many others within the Western establishment did not.

20099,20099,Fake Scandal: Any Senator or Government Official Can Pull Money from a Blind Trust Without Ever Telling Anyone - Breitbart,John Carney,"The latest attack against President Donald Trump for allegedly being too close to his and his family’s business interests suffers from a serious flaw: it is based on a trust agreement provision authorized by law and recommended by the U. S. Senate Select Committee on Ethics as well as the U. S. Office of Government Ethics. [The website ProPublica reported Monday that the documents governing the trust that holds Trump’s businesses were changed in February to instruct the trustee to make distributions to Trump when requested. “Trump can draw money from his more than 400 businesses, at any time, without disclosing it,” ProPublica explained.  According to ProPublica, this shows “just how little separation there actually is” between the Trump businesses and the U. S. government. To anyone familiar with the blind trust agreements signed by government officials, however, this is nonsense. Almost every trust agreement signed by U. S. government officials authorizes distributions upon request of the official for whom the trust is established. The sample blind trust agreement distributed by the staff of the Senate Ethics Committee is the model document used by senators and their staffs for setting up trusts. It authorizes precisely the kind of requests for distributions that has ProPublica scandalized. Section 7 of the agreement reads: There shall be no direct or indirect communication between an interested party and the Trusteee with respect to the Trust unless —   (A) It related to a request for a distribution from the Trust of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust or  …     Importantly, this is the only form of communication with the Trustee that doesn’t require written disclosure with the Ethics Committee. Just like Trump’s trust, the Senate model trust doesn’t require disclosure of requests for distributions. The Office of Government Ethics, an independent agency within the executive branch, uses very similar language in its model blind trust agreement. SEVENTH: There shall be no direct or indirect communication between an interested party or 21 any representative of an interested party and the Trustee with respect to the Trust unless the 22 communication is in writing and has the prior written approval of the Director, U. S. Office of 23 Government Ethics, and unless it relates only  —   (A) To a request for a distribution of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust  …     There’s a very good reason why both agreements allow government officials to request distributions from their trusts without requiring any prior disclosure: that’s what the law says. The requirements for a blind trust for government officials are set out in the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. The law bars most communications between government officials and their trustees but it explicitly allows for requests for distributions.   …    except for communications which solely consist of requests for distributions of cash or other unspecified assets of the trust, there shall be no direct or indirect communication between the trustee and an interested party with respect to the trust unless such communication is in writing and unless it relates only [to certain permitted topics]. In other words, the authorization of undisclosed requests from distributions in Trump’s trust agreement is fully in keeping with the law and the government’s standard agreements. The small change revealed by ProPublica brought Trump’s trust into further conformity with the trusts used by other government officials and U. S. senators. This is just another Gold Easter Egg: a story that falsely depicts something as a scandal because Trump does it when it is, in fact, totally normal.",0

One of the most important questions is will US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton rig the election to win the White House like she did in the primaries against Bernie Sanders, asks Myles Hoenig, an American political analyst and activist. 
Recent polls show that Clinton’s national lead over Trump is shrinking as the Election Day is approaching. 
The former secretary of state has the support of 49 percent of likely voters, while the billionaire businessman has 44 percent support, according to the CNN/ORC survey released on Monday. 
Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson has 3 percent support among likely voters, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein has 2 percent support. 
“In every election the race tightens towards the end,” Hoenig told Press TV on Thursday. 
“It’s really hard to imagine that there is any flux in this election as the supporters of both sides absolutely hate the other. With Obama and Romney, or even Gore and Bush, many of…",1
20101,20101,How to Predict Gentrification: Look for Falling Crime - The New York Times,Emily Badger,"Everyone has theories for why     professionals are moving back into parts of cities shunned by their parents’ generation. Perhaps their living preferences have shifted. Or the demands of the labor market have, and young adults with less leisure time are loath to waste it commuting. Maybe the tendency to postpone marriage and children has made city living more alluring. Or the benefits of cities themselves have improved. “There are all sorts of potential other amenities, whether it’s cafes, restaurants, bars, nicer parks, better schools,” said Ingrid Gould Ellen, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. “But a huge piece of it,” she said, “I think is crime. ” New research that she has conducted alongside Keren Mertens Horn, an economist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, and Davin Reed, a doctoral student at N. Y. U. finds that when violent crime falls sharply, wealthier and educated people are more likely to move into   and predominantly minority urban neighborhoods. Their working paper suggests that just as rising crime can drive people out of cities, falling crime has a comparable effect, spurring gentrification. And it highlights how, even if many Americans  —   including, by his own words,   Donald Trump  —   inaccurately believe urban violence is soaring, the opposite   trend has brought   change to cities. “We’re trying to help people understand what a dramatic difference the reduction in violent crime in particular has made in our environment,” Ms. Ellen said. “That has repercussions far beyond what we think of. The homicide rate has gone down  —   that’s directly the most important consequence. But there are all sorts of repercussions as well. This really has been a sea change. ” Nationally, violent crime peaked in 1991. It fell precipitously for the next decade, then more slowly through the 2000s (and there’s a whole other set of theories about why that has happened). While homicides have increased recently in some cities, rates remain far below what they were 25 years ago, including in Chicago. (Another    reality check, while we’re at it: Mr. Trump said during the 2016 campaign that homicides in his new home in Washington were rising by 50 percent, apparently citing the previous year’s crime statistics. At that time in July, though, the rate in the city was already falling compared with 2015, and by year’s end, it was down by 17 percent.) The new research looked at confidential geocoded data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses, and more recent American Community Surveys, to identify the neighborhoods where more than four million households moved. Using citywide violent crime data from the F. B. I. the scholars tracked the changing probability of different demographic groups moving into central cities, as opposed to suburbs, as crime fell.   and   movers  —   and to a lesser degree, whites  —   appeared significantly more sensitive to changing crime levels in their housing decisions than other groups.   and minority households, for instance, didn’t become more likely to move to cities as they grew safer. That may reflect the fact, Ms. Ellen suggested, that   families have more experience or confidence in their ability to navigate crime. Or it may suggest that attention to violence is a luxury in housing decisions that the poor and minorities may not have. A household facing racial discrimination, high housing costs or the need to be near supportive family members simply has fewer options  —   and less leeway to be choosy  —   than the     households that this research identifies. “When cities feel safer, that opens people’s eyes,” Ms. Ellen said of the willingness of new groups to consider these neighborhoods. It’s entirely likely that the arrival of more affluent residents affected crime, too  —   either by increasing opportunities for property crime in the short term, or by adding eyes on the street and pressure on the police in the long run. Because this research looked at moves that occurred after crime was already falling, the authors believe the movers were reacting to changes in crime and not simply causing it themselves. But the relationship between crime and gentrification in particular is complex. Wealthier residents may bring new tensions to neighborhoods, fearing  —   and reporting  —   criminal activity where none exists. And such demographic change in cities could play a role in pressuring the police to pursue tactics that feel unduly aggressive to the people who preceded the newcomers. This study also doesn’t offer evidence that existing residents were displaced by the new arrivals. Many of the urban neighborhoods studied had lost population, so they had room to grow again without pushing existing residents out. But the possibility that these trends portend higher housing costs and more housing demand in the future in poorer, minority neighborhoods adds a cautionary note, Ms. Ellen said, to the declining crime trend.",0
20102,20102,"Southern California Fire Flared Up at 5 Acres. A Day Later, It Covered 25,000. - The New York Times",Ciaran Mcevoy and Jess Bidgood,"FONTANA, Calif.  —   The fire in Cajon Pass was first reported as a   blaze along a highway 13 miles northeast of San Bernardino. So John McColly went about his business when he saw the smoke from Mountain High, a ski resort to the west of Wrightwood, where he works. Kevin Foree, a roofer working in Bellflower, southwest of the fire, heard about the blaze, but he figured he would have no trouble getting home to Victorville, to the northeast. But the speed of the Blue Cut Fire stunned even experienced fire officials. Fed by a buffet of shrubs squeezed of moisture and coaxed by the wind, the flames roared through 2, 500 acres, then 6, 500 acres in a matter of hours. Evacuations were ordered and major highways, including the interstate that links Los Angeles and Las Vegas, began to close. That, Mr. McColly said, was a signal that it was “time to go. ” The ski resort’s 40 or so employees joined thousands of other residents  —   many with their vehicles packed with whatever fit  —   fleeing the onrushing flames. About 82, 000 residents in an estimated 34, 500 homes were ordered to evacuate. By Wednesday, the fire had consumed more than 25, 000 acres, burning houses, businesses and outbuildings in its wake. (The official measurement lowered the estimate from about 30, 000 acres earlier in the day.) It was still raging out of control late in the day, and officials were warning residents to prepare for the worst. “There will be a lot of families that come home to nothing,” said Mark Hartwig, the San Bernardino County fire chief. Mr. Foree, a transplant from Northern California, was stuck overnight in a Red Cross shelter here. On Wednesday, still wearing his khaki shorts and work boots, he worried that his mother would run low on medication before he could get home. He marveled at the fire, which he said had taken even seasoned locals like his girlfriend’s family by surprise. “They have never seen anything like this,” he said. Mr. McColly, like many other evacuees from Wrightwood, found safety by heading west toward Pasadena. At midday Wednesday, the resort was still not threatened by the fire. Fire officials warned on Wednesday that explosive fires like this one were becoming more common. “It’s to the point where explosive fire growth is the new normal this year, and that’s a challenge for all of us to take on,” said Glenn Barley, the San Bernardino unit chief of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as CalFire. The fire has been a jolt during a fire season that has been quieter than usual nationwide. Experts said this season has had about a quarter fewer fires start and acres burn for this point in the year. Nevertheless, several recently ignited wildfires are burning in California, although they have not moved as quickly as Blue Cut. The Chimney Fire, which began on Saturday, has burned 7, 300 acres in San Luis Obispo and was 25 percent contained. The Clayton Fire, near Lower Lake in Northern California, started the same day, and has burned nearly 4, 000 acres. It was 40 percent contained. And the Soberanes Fire, in Monterey County, has burned almost 80, 000 acres over nearly two months. The enduring drought may have played a role here, even as relief comes elsewhere. “You’ve had three, four years of drought that’s been going on, so the conditions in the mountains are just prime for a large fire,” said David Simeral, a climatologist and an author for the United States Drought Monitor. “You’ve got all the dry fuels, low humidity and winds, it’s a formula for fires spreading quickly. ” Richard Minnich, a professor in the department of earth sciences at the University of California, Riverside, said it was not so much the   drought, but the weather of the day  —   coupled with a prevailing fire management strategy in which, he said, small fires are knocked down quickly but larger ones can grow more out of control  —   that had driven the fire. The low humidity, Mr. Minnich said, had dried out shrubs and bushes  —   known as chaparral  —   making them as flammable as a carpet. “It’s got a reputation for burning explosively,” he said of the chaparral, adding, “As soon as it’s blowing up like that, the capacity to stop the fire goes to zero. ” What no one disputes, however, is that, in less than 24 hours, the fire had turned people’s lives upside down. Outside the shelter here, Cathleen Coakley, 54, stood with her two small dogs. Sheriff’s deputies had canvassed her neighborhood in Lytle Creek on Tuesday, ordering everyone to leave, and she left almost everything behind, including five more dogs and five cats. “I want to go home. I want to check on my animals,” she said. “You just have to have faith that you will have a home to go to. ”",0
20103,20103,"Welcome Back to a Bipolar World, Courtesy of a Moscow-Beijing-Tehran Axis - Federico Pieraccini",Federico Pieraccini,"Welcome Back to a Bipolar World, Courtesy of a Moscow-Beijing-Tehran Axis 
America's 'unipolar moment' is over, but the long-awaited 'multipolar world' isn't quite yet here either Originally appeared at Strategic Culture Foundation 

The transition in the international order, from a pre-WWI multipolar world to a post-WWII bipolar world, cost humanity a world war involving millions of deaths. The next stage, distinct from the conflicts between the USSR and the US, ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, but without the tragedy of direct confrontation. This fundamental historical difference has its own intrinsic logic governing the relationship of forces between powers. The USSR was a country in decline, unable to continue its role on the international stage as the premier anti-hegemonic power. 
The transition from a bipolar to a unipolar reality could have had nuclear consequences, but an agreement between the powers avoided this danger. The upshot was an unconditional surrender of the USSR, with catastrophic consequences in economic and cultural terms for the superpower to come to terms with, but at least without the explosion of a large-scale conflict. 
With the end of the bipolar model, however, began what some historians declared to be the « end of history »: the transition from a multipolar world, to a bipolar world, to end in a unipolar world. From the point of view of Washington, the story ended with only one global power remaining, thereby granting the United States the power to decide matters for the whole world. 
The scenario in which we live today, in terms of international law and the balance of forces, is almost unprecedented in history if looked at in the present context. It is true that the current transition from a unipolar to a multipolar reality is something similar to what has been seen in previous decades, with the transition from British hegemony in the late-nineteenth century to a multipolar situation in the period preceding the two world wars. Nevertheless, resorting to this historical analogy is difficult, given the relative absence of international rules compared to a century ago. Therefore it is difficult to use the earlier transition period to make assumptions about future trends. 
The causes of change 
The attitude of the US over the last 25 years has been focused completely on the achievement of global hegemony. The dream of having control over every event, in every corner of the world, has ironically led to accelerating the end of America’s unipolar moment. Of course the deep meaning of the word ""control"" can be expanded upon, examining the merits of the cultural, economic and military impositions that result from a constant quest for global domination . 
The US has chosen an impassable road that is full of contradictions to justify their rise as a global power. In two decades we have witnessed the dismantling of all the key principles of the balance of power between Russia and the United States, necessitating the change in international relations from unipolar to multipolar. Similarly, the ratio of economic and military power between China and the United States has significantly worsened, culminating in the dangerous dispute over the South China Sea. The abandonment of the Kissinger doctrine governing relations with Beijing, and the failure of the Clinton reset with Moscow, have pushed two global powers, Russia and China, to forge an alliance that allows for a world where there are more powers on the international stage and not just Washington as the central focus of global relations. 
The failure of the foreign doctrine of the United States was a direct consequence of the arrogance and the utopia of being able to dominate the planet, seeking to extend indefinitely the unipolar moment and forging a worldwide system culturally and economically based on the will of Washington, reinforced by a power and military posture without precedent. 
Consequences 
Had Washington thought more carefully about the consequences of their actions, and thereby employed a more considered strategic vision, it would certainly have opted for different choices. As a demonstration of this, we note Washington’s attitude in the Middle East, the deciding ground for prospects of continued US global hegemony. 
Much of Washington’s remaining capacity to influence global decisions is attributable to the dollar and the trading of goods such as oil in that currency. With the appearance of a world with more regional or global powers, it is easy to guess that the rise of the Iranian Republic has consequences for the whole of the Middle East region. The odds are evident that Tehran, culturally, economically and militarily, will be the first regional power. Washington has realized this and has decided to reach an agreement with the Islamic Republic in order to remain relevant in the region and not to be cut off from future agreements. Washington also seeks, in doing so, to counterbalance the situation with her most influential regional allies, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. 
It is a strategy that in the Middle East has had a negative impact in the immediate present for Riyadh, Doha, and in some ways even Ankara, who have all opted for an autonomous and interventionist approach in the region without much consultation with Washington. Nevertheless, the choice to include Iran as a dialogue partner for the Middle East balance has allowed Washington to conserve the illusion that in the future it will maintain an important role in regional decisions. This is a decision that has created many problems with historic allies, but Washington hopes, with a view to the future, to have made an appropriate choice. This also explains why so many of the neoconservatives and liberals (the promoters of a prolonged unipolar doctrine, the cause of so many failures ) are clearly opposed to this agreement. 
Washington and its establishment have opted for a cultural and economic confrontation with Moscow, possibly militarily with Beijing in the South China Sea, in the process impelling the emergence of a multipolar world in which more powers have the ability, by joining together, to resist the will of the greater global power. In fact, it is easier to frame the international balance in a multipolar model that is slowly becoming bipolar. 
We consider that Russia and China (and to a lesser extent Iran) do not possess the military capability to successfully oppose American power in a conventional conflict on a grand scale. For this reason, it is easy to understand that shaping a multipolar international order perhaps remains quite optimistic at this time. It is similarly optimistic to maintain a unipolar world order that remains anchored in the illusions of the American elite. 
Reality rather shows us a bipolar world, where the alternative pole to the US is represented by the union and alliances (cultural, economic and military) of Beijing, Moscow and Tehran. And their partnership has resulted in a change in the pattern of international relations. The cause of this union is to be found in the will of the US elites to prolong their unipolar moment. Instead of opting for an agreement with another global power (probably China) and seal the international stage in a realistic model with two poles, facing no real opposition, Washington has exacerbated the differences by pushing countries like Russia, China, Iran and India closer and closer together, forging what currently might be termed a temporary bipolar model of world order. 
The certainty is that the future will turn fully into a multipolar model, and this obliges Washington to struggle in every way possible to remain relevant. To date, apart from nuclear agreements, every choice has been counterproductive and wrong. Will Washington’s elites ever learn, or will they eventually become irrelevant?  ",1
20104,20104,"Trump: ’We’re Doing Very Well in Iraq,’ U.S. Troops ’Fighting Like Never Before’",John Hayward,"On Tuesday, President Trump told a group of senators gathered for a White House reception that “we’re doing very well in Iraq” where “our soldiers are fighting like never before. ” He said this assessment was based on a long telephone call with Secretary of Defense James Mattis. [Trump’s comments were interpreted by some critics as a slam against the American troops who fought in the Iraq War  —   if they are “fighting like never before” now, the argument goes, Trump must think the soldiers deployed to Iraq in the Bush administration were not fighting so hard.  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer addressed this criticism on Wednesday, saying President Trump was referring to “progress, particularly in Mosul, the way that they have taken back that city. ” “I think that for a long time, there was a lot of concern about Iran moving in and dominating parts of Iraq,” Spicer continued. “I think with the advice and consent of U. S. military advisers, there’s been tremendous progress at moving Iraq forward to an area of stability, and continuing to see the troops there in Iraq standing on their own. ” Spicer said the president pleased with the action that General Mattis and our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are taking to do that. ” “He was very proud of the work that our soldiers are doing over there in Iraq. There is a lot of work, and a lot of progress that is being made,” said Spicer. “The fight against ISIS is going extremely well, and he’s proud of it. ” Critics of Trump’s fight against ISIS dwell on mounting civilian casualties and confusion in Iraq’s military ranks, but Doyle McManus at the L. A. Times wrote on Wednesday that Trump “may actually win the war against the Islamic State”: Under Obama, who waged a “light footprint” strategy with minimal U. S. troops, Islamic State lost most of the territory it once held in Iraq and almost a third of what it held in Syria. But taking the extremist group’s most important strongholds, Mosul in Iraq and Raqqah in Syria, was taking longer. Enter Trump. The new president, after claiming he had a secret plan to win the war, told his generals to give him one in 30 days. They responded with an outline  —   a “skeleton plan,” in the words of Defense Secretary James N. Mattis  —   that could be described as Obama Plus: more bombing, more troops, fewer restrictions on commanders. “The Obama strategy wasn’t failing, but it was slow,” James F. Jeffrey, a former ambassador (and former Army officer) who’s advising the administration, told me. “This is more  —   not only more troops, but more willingness to use them. It’s a change of maybe 20% but it’s an important 20%. ” McManus notes the task at hand is more complex than Trump’s campaign rhetoric about “bombing the s**t out of them,” blowing up “every single inch” of the Islamic State and then bringing in oil companies to rebuild from the ruins. He gives Defense Secretary Mattis credit for influencing White House policy, which now appears to envision aggressive military victory over ISIS, followed by an extended troop commitment to achieve “stabilization. ”",0

As the monetary madness continues around the globe continues, what is happening is stunning. 
Here is a portion of what Peter Boockvar wrote as the world awaits the next round of monetary madness: Coincident with the spike in Treasury yields, bankrate(dot)com said the average 30 yr mortgage rate rose another 11 bps yesterday to 3.88%, up 41 bps over the past week. It’s the highest since early January and here is a chart giving the visual of the rapidity of the move… IMPORTANT… To find out which company is set to become one of the highest grade producing gold mines on the planet CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored 
I look forward to seeing mortgage applications tomorrow to see the initial response. To quantify, at last Monday’s 30 yr rate of 3.47%, a $300k mortgage would have a monthly payment of $1,342.12. At the 3.88% rate, the monthly payment would increase by about $70 to $1,411.57, a 5.2% increase. 
The cost of capital is of course going up across the board and while I’m optimistic about growth initiatives to come, we’ve got to get past the move higher in rates because business activity and asset price gains have been built on the foundation of low rates over the past 7 years (as in the prior expansion). The US and the world also have an extraordinary amount of debt that has accumulated which has created the dangerous tinder for this rise in interest rates. 
King World News note: Mortgage rates based on the 10-Year Treasury have been headed dramatically higher as bonds plunge (see crashing chart below). 10-Year Treasuries Continue To Plunge As Interest Rates Rise 
King World News note: To illustrate how dramatically this has impacted mortgage rates, Wells Fargo’s posted rates for a 30-year conforming loan have risen in the past couple of weeks from 3.5% to 4.25%! That’s 3/4 of a point higher in just a couple of weeks. This will not bode well for the real estate market if the trend in higher interest rates continues.

20107,20107,Four Prominent Suffragist Grave Sites in the Bronx Anticipating a Surge in Visitors This Election Day - The New York Times,Katie Rogers,"Susan B. Anthony’s grave site, in Rochester, is a perennial destination for women celebrating their freedom to vote, but on Election Day, Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx would like to remind New Yorkers to share the love. At Woodlawn, the grave sites of four other prominent suffragists could use some “I Voted” stickers, like those dotting Anthony’s grave, David Ison, the cemetery’s executive director, said on Monday. The cemetery will even provide the stickers. The idea for turning the sites into    destinations came this year after seeing the popularity of Anthony’s grave site grow on social media, Mr. Ison said. The need for some positive messaging after a bruising election season was also important. “We thought, ‘We’re going to do something that’s not all about Trump and all about Clinton,’” Mr. Ison said. On Election Day, visitors will be encouraged to leave their stickers on cardboard signs next to the grave sites of four suffragists buried in Woodlawn: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anthony’s friend and a   of the National Woman Suffrage Association Carrie Chapman Catt, who founded the League of Women Voters and who is buried next to Mary Garrett Hay, who assisted and advised her and Alva Vanderbilt Belmont, a multimillionaire who gave her opinions and her money to the movement. On Monday, as the sun was setting and shadows turned the cemetery chilly, the site of Stanton’s grave was lonely. About 15 “I Voted” stickers were posted near the family monument. A single sticker for Hillary Clinton, the country’s first female presidential nominee from a major party, who has nodded to the suffragists’ legacy throughout her campaign, was also posted. Only one visitor passed by, a man who called out “not yet” to a reporter’s remark that no sticker for Mrs. Clinton’s opponent, Donald J. Trump, had been posted. The graves of the three other suffragists were also deserted. The quiet display is in contrast to reports from the resting place of Susan B. Anthony, where women approach every few minutes with their daughters, friends and mothers. This year, the Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester anticipates so many visitors that it said it would be open extended hours on Election Day to allow voters the opportunity to swing by and leave a sticker. Barbara Selesky, Woodlawn’s director of marketing, said on Tuesday that the cemetery would extend its visiting days, inviting people to leave their “I Voted” stickers until Sunday. For visitors who make the trek to the Bronx, the crew at Woodlawn asks just one thing: Please keep the stickers off the granite. The museum has put up a display next to the tombstone where visitors can leave stickers and other sticky mementos. “Stickers on graves have become a problem,” Susan Olsen, the cemetery’s historian, said. “It’s love and it’s honoring, but it just causes problems. ” At Woodlawn, a cemetery roughly half the size of Central Park, the legacy of four prominent suffragists competes for the limelight with several more famous neighbors, including Miles Davis, Celia Cruz and Herman Melville. When asked to explain the difference in popularity, Mr. Ison and Ms. Olsen both joked in unison, “There’s nothing else to do in Rochester. ” (Also, they said, Anthony was on the $1 coin.) But if the work of the suffragists has taught us anything, it’s that Stanton and Anthony might not have seen this as a competition. In a way, it may be fitting of how they saw their different legacies: Stanton, a married mother of seven who lived in New York, supplied speech material and support as Anthony traveled extensively as a public face of the movement. “They saw their relationship very clearly,” Ms. Olsen, Woodlawn’s historian, said. “She’s in the metropolis, and Anthony goes all over the place. They were brilliant as far as how their partnership worked. ” Neither woman lived to see the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920. In Stanton’s obituary, published in The New York Times in 1902, Anthony fondly recalled their dynamic, saying, “She forged the thunderbolts and I fired them. ”",0
20108,20108,"Immigration, Milo Yiannopoulos: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",Karen Zraick and Lisa Iaboni,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Trump administration detailed plans to deport millions of immigrants, a major shift in enforcement policy that is expected to face resistance from many states and dozens of   sanctuary cities. The new Homeland Security rules authorize the expulsion of undocumented immigrants who commit even minor offenses, and make it easier to deport people immediately. This is how deportation works, step by step. Immigration will be high on the agenda as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the secretary of homeland security, John F. Kelly, visit Mexico this week. _____  2. President Trump spoke out for the first time about the rise in incidents and threats targeting Jews and Jewish institutions, calling   “horrible,” and “painful. ” He said the venue for his comments, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, was “a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms. ” A day earlier, his daughter Ivanka Trump, who has converted to Judaism, called for protections as nearly a dozen Jewish community centers across the country received bomb threats by phone. Above, a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis where nearly 200 headstones were toppled over the weekend. _____ 3. Republicans home for the congressional recess have been greeted with an earful at town   meetings. Those who scheduled no meetings faced criticism that they were ducking constituents. In Iowa, a pig farmer (and Democrat) furious over the possible repeal of Obamacare gave Senator Charles Grassley a bottle of Tums. “You’re going to need ’em the next few years,” he said, drawing laughs from the crowd. _____ 4. Milo Yiannopoulos, the   provocateur who incited a storm of criticism for condoning sex with boys, left Breitbart News. His explanation of the comments, in a video that surfaced over the weekend, as “British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humor” appeared to sway few. He also lost a book deal and a speaking engagement at the Conservative Political Action Conference. _____ 5. A riot in an immigrant neighborhood in Sweden was seized upon by Trump supporters as validation of his claims  —   based on a Fox News feature  —   that the European country had experienced a surge in crime and violence linked to refugees. Preliminary statistics do not show a major increase in crime from 2015, when Sweden processed a record 163, 000 asylum applications, to 2016, and Mr. Trump’s assertions baffled Swedes. The country’s interior minister said of the clash that making “suburbs and socially vulnerable areas safer” could “get a little messy. ” _____ 6. Trinidad and Tobago is scrambling to stop young Muslims from going to Syria to take up arms for the Islamic State. Per capita, the Caribbean island nation has the largest number of foreign fighters from the Western Hemisphere who have joined the militant group, according to John L. Estrada, a former U. S. ambassador there. “Trinidadians do very well with ISIL,” he said. “They are high up in the ranks, they are very respected and they are  . ISIL have used them for propaganda to spread their message through the Caribbean. ” _____ 7. Political dissent is simmering in the art world.

20109,20109,Former Egyptian Ambassador: Trump Should Undo Obama’s Sponsorship of Muslim Brotherhood,Ali Waked,"TEL AVIV  —   President Abdel Fatah Sisi’s visit to the United States later this month will be an opportunity to undermine the Muslim Brotherhood’s standing in Washington, a former Egyptian ambassador to the US said. [Abdel Raouf   told Egyptian paper Alshorouk that “  relations are entering a new phase, and the degree of their success relies on Egyptian efforts. ”  “Presidents Trump and Sisi can break the ice created during the Obama administration,” he said. “Without doing injustice to Obama, he adopted the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood. ” He added that during Obama’s presidency, “the Muslim Brotherhood shifted their international center of gravity from London to Washington. In recent years the Muslim Brotherhood penetrated American institutions and think tanks, and disseminated their ideology as an alternative to extremism. ” The Muslim Brotherhood forged ideas and promoted people “that were recruited even by the National Security Council, and from there they disseminated the marketable view that their Islamic model is a moderate one that serves as a counterweight to terror and extremism, and this view found resonance in the United States. ” Conversely, the former ambassador said, “Egypt should distance itself from the concept of an Islamic international, i. e. advocate a democratic   modern and   that steers clear of extremism, and separates church and state. ” Sisi’s visit will be an “important opportunity to lay out Egypt’s vision for the region, especially after years of cool relations [with the US],”   said. “I think Trump is a president with original ideas, and what characterizes him is his ability to champion them bravely and resolutely. ”",0
20110,20110,UMass students hold ‘sh*t-in’ for gender-neutral bathrooms,PatriotRising,"Posted 11/16/2016 2:11 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Students at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst are staging a week-long “shit-in,” occupying restrooms in an administration building to demand more gender-neutral facilities. Gender Liberation UMass, the student group behind the demonstration, announced Tuesday that administrators had “tentatively agreed to progressive ‘benchmarks’ put forth by organizers,” but urges supporters to remain on-call. 
Students at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst are staging a week-long “shit-in,” occupying restrooms in an administration building to demand more gender-neutral facilities. 

The “ Shit-In at Whitmore ” demonstration began Monday morning at the Whitmore Administration building (which the activists have nicknamed “Queermore”), and organizers intend to have students continue occupying stalls in the building’s male and female restrooms until their demands are met, though the Facebook event specifies a Friday afternoon ending. 

“Maybe [administrators] will feel a little bit as anxious as trans students do just trying to pee on campus.” Tweet This 

Gender Liberation UMass (GLU), a student group at UMass, is responsible for organizing the event, and provides an online sign-up form for supporters to stake out specific times and locations, giving them the option of stating whether they prefer to be along in a stall or to share one with “other sitters.” 

The primary goal of the protest is to convince the administration to convert additional bathrooms on campus into gender-neutral facilities by changing the signage, which the group believes will promote “trans inclusivity and safety on campus,” but GLU has also articulated two additional demands, pledging to continue obstructing toilets until all three are met. 

In addition to gender-neutral restrooms, the group is calling for the “advancement of medically and socially competent in-house transgender health services at the University Health Services center,” as well as the “hiring of a professor by the WGSS [Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Department] who is an expert in the field of critical transmisogyny from an intersectional perspective.” 
Divest UMass, a student environmentalist group, released a statement on its Facebook page expressing solidarity with the GLU protesters 

“These demands are elementary, and it is disappointing that UMass has failed to meet the needs of trans and gender non-conforming students to date. The administration must seriously put a plan into action to de-gender its facilities,” the message declares. “In the meantime, maybe they will feel a little bit as anxious as trans students do just trying to pee on the campus they pay tuition to every single day.” 

Although the objectives of Divest UMass are not directly related to those being pursued by GLU, but leaders of the Divest group explained their interest in the “shit-in” by asserting that all progressive causes are interrelated, saying, “There can be no climate justice without gender justice. There can no be gender justice without racial justice. There can no be racial justice without economic justice. There can be no economic justice without social justice.” 

Within a day of the restroom occupation starting, GLU announced that it had secured a meeting with Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Enku Gelaye on Tuesday morning to discuss its demands, and subsequently reported Tuesday evening that administrators had “tentatively agreed to progressive ‘benchmarks’ put forth by organizers.” 

“The administration is definitely listening and the tones of our conversation have changed quite a bit,” one GLU member told Campus Reform , though the group is cautioning its supporters to remain prepared, because “the need for action may arise at any moment.” 

“Changing the signage really is not very expensive, and I don’t want to talk bad about the administration here, but that’s one of the things we’ve had to go back and forth about, is this idea of the cost of it,” another GLU member added. “I and other members of GLU think the numbers they have proposed for what it would cost to change the signage are way beyond what it would really be.” 

UMass Executive Director of Strategic Communications Ed Blaguszewski, however, told Campus Reform that the university is committed to expanding the availability of gender-neutral restrooms, making no mention of cost concerns while asserting that university officials would continue to meet regularly with transgender students to discuss their concerns. 

“Currently, there are more than 200 gender-inclusive, single-user restrooms on campus, and during the coming year more than 50 will be added, either by construction or by converting single-user ‘Men’ or ‘Women’ facilities to ‘Restrooms,’” he explained, adding that “All new construction and major renovations on campus will include gender-inclusive restrooms.",1

20112,20112,This is the Man Militarized Police at Standing Rock are Working For,The Mind Unleashed,"This is the Man Militarized Police at Standing Rock are Working For Nov 15, 2016 0 0 
The months long Dakota Access Keystone XL pipleine protest at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation by Native Americans and those sympathetic to protection of our water supply has been met with heavy-handed and brutal clamp down by police and national guard. Militarized goons in battle dress have stormed protector camps with LRAD sonic weapons, attack dogs , tear gas, tazers , and even live ammunition ( killing horses ), while politicians and mainstream media do their best to ignore this growing atrocity, hoping to wait it out until the protestors give up. 
But, as the saying goes, Water Is Life , and the issue of life and death is at the root of this protection movement, therefore, for people concerned with life, giving up on this is simply unthinkable. The root issue justifying state oppression of the protest is capitalism, and the perception that money is more important than life itself. When the police and national guard attack U.S. citizens on private property to protect corporate interests, who are they really working for? 
The corporate dream of the Keystone XL pipeline is to create a profit stream for a small number of people at the expense of the natural world and anyone in the way. At the top of this pyramid of profit is Texas billionaire Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for the project. 
So who is Kelcy Warren? 
A native of East Texas and graduate of the University of Texas at Arlington with a degree in civil engineering, Warren worked in the natural gas industry and became co-chair of Energy Transfer Equity in 2007. With business partner Ray Davis, co-owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team, Warren built Energy Transfer Equity into one of the nation’s largest pipeline companies, which now owns about 71,000 miles of pipelines carrying natural gas, natural gas liquids, refined products and crude oil. The company’s holdings include Sunoco, Southern Union and Regency Energy Partners. 
Forbes estimates the 60-year-old Warren’s personal wealth at $4 billion. Bloomberg described him as “among America’s new shale tycoons” — but rather than building a fortune by drilling he “takes the stuff others pull from underground and moves it from one place to another, chilling, boiling, pressurizing, and processing it until it’s worth more than when it burst from the wellhead.” [ Source ] 
Shockingly, in 2015 the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, appointed Warren to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission which is an insult to environmentalists working to protect Big Bend National Park and surrounding sacred tribal lands from another $770 million pipeline project . 
“According to the governor’s office, the state parks and wildlife commission “manages and conserves the natural and cultural resources of Texas,” along with ensuring the future of hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities for Texans.” [ Source ] 
This glaring conflict of interest has inspired Environmental Science major at UTSA and former Texas State Park Ambassador Andrew Lucas to begin a drive to have Warren removed from this environmental post. His petition is described here : 
Most people may know Kelcy Warren as the man behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. The Dallas-based billionaire and CEO of Energy Transfer Partners has been making headlines for fast-tracking a 1100 mile crude oil pipeline across the Midwest and under the Missouri River, just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. No environmental impact assessment, no respect for cultural sites, and no regard for the local and widespread communities living along the river. A similar story is unfolding out in West Texas, where Warren’s company has split through the pristine Big Bend region with the 200 mile Comanche Trail Pipeline and nearly-complete 143 mile Trans Pecos Pipeline. These Pipelines mark the way for massive natural gas and oil developments in the Trans Pecos region. 
With untold damages unfolding for cultural and environmental resources at the hands of Energy Transfer Partners, it would surprise most to know that nearly a year ago, Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed Kelcy Warren for a 6 year term as 1 of the 10 commissioners who preside over Texas Parks And Wildlife… Why? Probably the $550,000 in campaign contributions Abbott received from Warren. 
Footage of militarized police using the Long Range Acoustic Device ( LRAD ) crowd control weapon against protectors at standing rock on October 27th, 2016: Final Thoughts 
Warren is listed as number 150 on Forbes list of wealthiest Americans with an estimated net worth of $4.2 billion in September of 2016. He is the head of the Dakota Access Pipeline snake. 
If you are scratching your head wondering why militarized police and private security contractors are beating, gassing and attacking peaceful resistors, including women, children and the elderly, the answer is, they are doing it to protect the interests of Kelcy Warren and others invested in this pipeline project.

20113,20113,Jury Deadlocks in Trial of Ex-Officer in Killing of Unarmed Black Driver in Cincinnati - The New York Times,Andy Newman,"The murder trial of a white former University of Cincinnati police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black driver last year ended in a mistrial on Saturday after the jurors told the judge they were unable to reach a verdict. The jurors first informed the judge on Friday that they were deadlocked, but they were told to continue deliberations. On Saturday morning, the judge declared a mistrial. Officer Ray Tensing fatally shot Samuel DuBose, 43, during a traffic stop as Mr. DuBose started to drive off. Mr. Tensing, 26, claimed that he felt that Mr. Dubose’s car was dragging him and that he fired at him because he feared he would be run over. The encounter was captured on video and set off protests. Mr. Tensing was charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter. A murder conviction  —   which requires jurors to find that he had intentionally killed Mr. DuBose  —   carries a sentence of 15 years to life in prison. A conviction on voluntary manslaughter  —   which requires them to find that he acted in a fit of rage or sudden passion  —   carries a sentence of up to five years. The jury of 10 whites and two blacks began deliberating just after noon on Wednesday. On July 19, 2015, Mr. Tensing pulled over Mr. Dubose’s 1998 Honda Accord a few blocks south of campus for having no front license plate.   video released by prosecutors shows Mr. Tensing asking Mr. DuBose for his license and Mr. DuBose eventually acknowledging he does not have one with him. Mr. DuBose shows the officer the missing license plate in his glove box. After the officer starts to open the driver’s door, Mr. DuBose pulls it closed and restarts the car. In several chaotic seconds, the engine can be heard revving, the officer reaches into the car with one hand, yells “stop” twice, and draws and fires his gun once with the other hand. Mr. DuBose, a father of 12 with a previous conviction for selling marijuana, was shot in the head. The authorities said that several bags of marijuana and more than $2, 500 in cash were found in the car. His license had been suspended indefinitely months before. The shooting  —   then the latest in a string of police killings of unarmed blacks, including ones in Staten Island, Cleveland, Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo.  —   caused an immediate uproar. Ten days later, Mr. Tensing was indicted on murder charges as the Hamilton County prosecutor, Joseph T. Deters, called the episode a “senseless, asinine shooting. ” At demonstrations across the country, protesters chanted, “I am Sam DuBose. ” Mr. Tensing was fired after the indictment. A report by a   firm hired by the university said that the video showed that Mr. Tensing was not being dragged, that the car had barely moved before the gunshot was fired and that Mr. Tensing had made several critical errors  —   including drawing his gun and reaching into the car. In January, the university agreed to pay $4. 85 million to Mr. Dubose’s family and provide an undergraduate education to his 12 children. At trial, prosecutors and their expert witnesses told jurors that the video showed that Mr. Tensing was not being dragged. Mr. Tensing, who had four years of law enforcement service with various departments, testified on Tuesday that his arm was caught inside Mr. DuBose’s car as it began to move and that he feared for his life. Regardless of what the video showed, Mr. Tensing’s lawyer said, the officer had the “perception” that he was being dragged and fired in  .",0
20114,20114,North Korean Leader’s Top Enforcer Is Now the One Getting Purged - The New York Times,Choe Sang-Hun,"SEOUL, South Korea  —   The chief of North Korea’s powerful secret police, long considered the   man for the top leader, Kim   has been dismissed on charges of corruption and abuse of power, the South Korean government said on Friday. The firing of the chief, Gen. Kim   as minister of state security highlights the turmoil that has engulfed the upper reaches of Mr. Kim’s government. The general is the latest in a series of   party and military officials Mr. Kim has fired, demoted or executed as he tried to consolidate his totalitarian power through what South Korean officials and North Korean defectors have called a “reign of terror. ” General Kim was fired in   after he was demoted to a   general from a   one, said Jeong   a spokesman for the South’s Unification Ministry. The general’s surprise downfall was the latest indication that even top lieutenants are at risk as Mr. Kim has rival agencies monitor one another to detect and punish any sign of disrespect or disloyalty. Until his dismissal, General Kim had been Mr. Kim’s chief henchman in purging potential enemies. “Kim   has been a key aide to Kim   and has buttressed his reign of terror,” Mr. Jeong said. “His dismissal could further deepen unrest among officials and add to the instability of the regime by weakening its control on the people. ” Mr. Jeong said General Kim was accused of corruption and held responsible for various human rights violations, including torture, committed at his agency. But other political machinations could be at play behind the dismissal, Mr. Jeong said, citing speculation about a rivalry among different power centers. Mr. Jeong noted that the dismissal resulted from an investigation by another powerful agency, the Organization and Guidance Department of the governing Workers’ Party of North Korea. The department supervises all state agencies and is reportedly directly overseen by Mr. Kim. “The Organization and Guidance Department is conducting an intensive investigation of Kim   and the Ministry of State Security, so the level of punishment and the number of people affected could be expanded,” Mr. Jeong said, without disclosing how the South Korean government learned of the reported purge transpiring inside a secretive regime. The Ministry of State Security, which serves as the secret police and intelligence agency in the North, is one of the most feared tools of government there, responsible for arresting dissidents and running a network of prison gulags. When Mr. Kim executed his own uncle and No. 2 official, Jang   on charges of factionalism, corruption and plotting to overthrow his government in 2013, it was General Kim’s ministry that arrested and   Mr. Jang. Since taking power after the death of his father in 2011, Mr. Kim has frequently reshuffled the party and military elites as he has moved swiftly to establish his monolithic authority in North Korea, which his family has ruled for seven decades. Mr. Kim has executed at least 140 senior officials, usually killing them with machine guns and even flamethrowers, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank affiliated with the South’s National Intelligence Service. Thae   who was the North’s No. 2 diplomat in London until his defection to South Korea last summer, said he fled partly because of Mr. Kim’s reign of terror. General Kim, 71, served in various top military positions under Mr. Kim, said Cheong   a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute, a South Korea research organization. He had been the top political officer of the North’s People’s Army and chief of its general staff, as well as its minister of armed forces. Purges and executions remain an important feature of political life in the North. In 2015, South Korean officials said that Gen. Hyon   the defense minister, was executed with an antiaircraft gun in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, after he dozed off during military events and   Mr. Kim’s orders. In August, they said Mr. Kim had found fault with a deputy premier’s “disrespectful posture” during a meeting and had him executed by a firing squad.",0

20116,20116,Devin Nunes to Step Aside From House Investigation on Russia - The New York Times,Emmarie Huetteman,"WASHINGTON  —   The continuing fallout from President Trump’s unsubstantiated wiretapping allegation cost him another ally on Thursday, as the embattled Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee announced he would step aside from his panel’s investigation into Russia’s efforts to disrupt last year’s election. The announcement from the committee’s chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California, came shortly before the House Committee on Ethics said he was under investigation because of public reports that he “may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information. ” Mr. Nunes’s recusal from the Russia inquiry was a blow to Mr. Trump, who in less than three months in office has seen the imbroglio over Russia’s disruption campaign exact political damage on some of his closest advisers and most vigorous supporters. The furor over the contacts that some of the president’s aides had with Russian officials has already led to the firing of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, and the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from overseeing the F. B. I. ’s inquiry into the Russian efforts. Now it has led to the recusal of Mr. Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation, and Mr. Trump faces the potential revival of that inquiry. The investigation had descended into a partisan sideshow in the two weeks since Mr. Nunes told reporters that Trump associates had been swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by American spy agencies during the transition, citing intelligence reports that were classified. He then rushed to the White House to brief Mr. Trump, prompting Democrats to argue that Mr. Nunes had proved himself far too close to the president to run an independent investigation. The criticism intensified last week when The New York Times revealed that the classified information about incidental surveillance cited by Mr. Nunes came from White House officials. White House officials had been seeking evidence to bolster a claim that Mr. Trump made March 4 on Twitter that the Obama administration had wiretapped Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. Numerous current and former American officials  —   including James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director  —   have debunked the claim. Yet Mr. Nunes resisted demands to step aside until Thursday, when he found himself under investigation by the House ethics committee. The internal House ethics investigation into whether Mr. Nunes disclosed classified information is a striking twist for a chairman who has made the unauthorized disclosure of classified information a focal point of his Russia investigation. At the same time, he has repeatedly dismissed the idea that he was wrong to disclose the existence of “dozens” of classified intelligence reports about incidental surveillance of associates of Mr. Trump. “Any talk of that is nonsense,” Mr. Nunes said in an interview with The Times last month. Mr. Nunes said in a statement that the ethics investigation was “entirely false and politically motivated” and that he would remain the intelligence committee’s chairman. But it was in the intelligence committee’s best interests for him to temporarily step aside from the Russia investigation, he said in the statement, which was issued 26 minutes before the ethics committee announced its inquiry. The statement also put the blame for the investigation on complaints against him made by multiple watchdog groups to the Office of Congressional Ethics, which is entirely separate from the ethics committee. Mr. Nunes dismissed those organizations as “  activist groups,” though it was not clear what role, if any, their complaints played in setting off the inquiry. Mr. Nunes, who served on the president’s transition team, has for weeks offered Mr. Trump fuel to keep his wiretapping claims in the news  —   and to make more unsubstantiated accusations. In an interview with The Times on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that the former national security adviser Susan E. Rice might have committed a crime by seeking the identities of the Trump associates who last year were swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by American spy agencies. Ms. Rice has said she did nothing wrong. Mr. Nunes’s recusal on Thursday was welcomed by Democrats, who had questioned whether White House officials had used the congressman essentially to launder the information about incidental surveillance. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the panel’s top Democrat, praised the chairman’s decision. “It will allow us to have a fresh start moving forward,” he told reporters on Thursday. Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, a senior Republican on the committee, will assume control of the investigation. An accountant who formerly served as the chairman of the House ethics committee, Mr. Conaway will be assisted by two other Republicans on the committee, Mr. Nunes said: Representatives Tom Rooney of Florida and Trey Gowdy of South Carolina. Mr. Gowdy led the special investigation into the 2012 attacks on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. Mr. Gowdy is also on the ethics committee. Several of the watchdog groups that had complained to the separate Office of Congressional Ethics praised the ethics committee’s decision to investigate Mr. Nunes. Jordan Libowitz, spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, described the congressman’s disclosure of classified information as “so grave that it needs to be investigated right away. ” The ethics committee comprises 10 House members: five Republicans and five Democrats. It is unclear how long the inquiry could take, but the investigations usually last months or years. The panel has the power to impose a range of penalties, from a letter admonishing a member to a recommendation that the House vote to expel a member. In more serious cases, the panel can choose to refer evidence to law enforcement officials, a move it can make confidentially. The independent Office of Congressional Ethics faced a threat in early January when House Republicans voted to gut it on the eve of the new Congress. Under pressure from Republican leaders and President Trump, they ultimately abandoned the effort. The recusal offered hope to Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, who worried that Mr. Nunes’s behavior had discredited the panel’s investigation and who had increasingly resigned themselves to the idea that they would have to conduct parallel inquiries rather than work with Republicans. “We now have a chance to reclaim our committee’s independence, credibility and ability to make progress,” Representative Eric Swalwell of California said in a statement. As the House investigation has deteriorated into partisan feuding in recent weeks, many have turned to the Senate Intelligence Committee as Congress’s last best hope for an impartial congressional investigation into Russian interference in the election. Since late July, the F. B. I. has been conducting its own counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the election, including an examination of whether Mr. Trump’s associates cooperated with Russian officials to influence the race.",0
20117,20117,"Re: We Are Being Set Up For Higher Interest Rates, A Major Recession And A Giant Stock Market Crash",Mike Smithy,"Why Is Obama Threatening Russia With World War 3 Right Before The Election? Michael On Television We Are Being Set Up For Higher Interest Rates, A Major Recession And A Giant Stock Market Crash   November 20th, 2016 
Since Donald Trump’s victory on election night we have seen the worst bond crash in 15 years . Global bond investors have seen trillions of dollars of wealth wiped out since November 8th, and analysts are warning of another tough week ahead. The general consensus in the investing community is that a Trump administration will mean much higher inflation, and as a result investors are already starting to demand higher interest rates. Unfortunately for all of us, history has shown that higher interest rates always cause an economic slowdown. And this makes perfect sense, because economic activity naturally slows down when it becomes more expensive to borrow money. The Obama administration had already set up the next president for a major recession anyway, but now this bond crash threatens to bring it on sooner rather than later. 
For those that are not familiar with the bond market, when yields go up bond prices go down. And when bond prices go down, that is bad news for economic growth. 
So we generally don’t want yields to go up. 
Unfortunately, yields have been absolutely soaring over the past couple of weeks, and the yield on 10 year Treasury notes has now jumped “one full percentage point since July” … 
The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.36% in late trading on Friday, the highest since December 2015, up 66 basis point since the election, and up one full percentage point since July! 
The 10-year yield is at a critical juncture. In terms of reality, the first thing that might happen is a rate increase by the Fed in December, after a year of flip-flopping. A slew of post-election pronouncements by Fed heads – including Yellen’s “relatively soon” – have pushed the odds of a rate hike to 98%. 
As I noted the other day , so many things in our financial system are tied to yields on U.S. Treasury notes. Just look at what is happening to mortgages. As Wolf Richter has noted , the average rate on 30 year mortgages is shooting into the stratosphere… 
The carnage in bonds has consequences. The average interest rate of the a conforming 30-year fixed mortgage as of Friday was quoted at 4.125% for top credit scores. That’s up about 0.5 percentage point from just before the election, according to Mortgage News Daily . It put the month “on a short list of 4 worst months in more than a decade.” 
If mortgage rates continue to shoot higher, there will be another housing crash. 
Rates on auto loans, credit cards and student loans will also be affected. Throughout our economic system it will become much more costly to borrow money, and that will inevitably slow the overall economy down. 
Why bond investors are so on edge these days is because of statements such as this one from Steve Bannon … 
In a nascent administration that seems, at best, random in its beliefs, Bannon can seem to be not just a focused voice, but almost a messianic one: 
“Like [Andrew] Jackson’s populism, we’re going to build an entirely new political movement,” he says. “It’s everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy. I’m the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. With negative interest rates throughout the world, it’s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up. We’re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. It will be as exciting as the 1930s, greater than the Reagan revolution — conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement.” 
Steve Bannon is going to be one of the most influential voices in the new Trump administration, and he is absolutely determined to get this “trillion dollar infrastructure plan” through Congress. 
And that is going to mean a lot more borrowing and a lot more spending for a government that is already on pace to add 2.4 trillion dollars to the national debt this fiscal year. 
Sadly, all of this comes at a time when the U.S. economy is already starting to show significant signs of slowing down. It is being projected that we will see a sixth straight decline in year-over-year earnings for the S&P 500, and industrial production has now contracted for 14 months in a row . 
The truth is that the economy has been barely treading water for quite some time now, and it isn’t going to take much to push us over the edge. The following comes from Lance Roberts … 
With an economy running at below 2%, consumers already heavily indebted, wage growth weak for the bulk of American’s, there is not a lot of wiggle room for policy mistakes. 
Combine weak economics with higher interest rates, which negatively impacts consumption, and a stronger dollar, which weighs on exports, and you have a real potential of a recession occurring sooner rather than later. 
Yes, the stock market soared immediately following Trump’s election, but it wasn’t because economic conditions actually improved. 
If you look at history, a stock market crash almost always follows a major bond crash. So if bond prices keep declining rapidly that is going to be a very ominous sign for stock traders. 
And history has also shown us that no bull market can survive a major recession. If the economy suffers a major downturn early in the Trump administration, it is inevitable that stock prices will follow. 
The waning days of the Obama administration have set us up perfectly for higher interest rates, a major recession and a giant stock market crash. 
Of course any problems that occur after January 20th, 2017 will be blamed on Trump, but the truth is that Obama will be far more responsible for what happens than Trump will be. 
Right now so many people have been lulled into a sense of complacency because Donald Trump won the election. 
That is an enormous mistake. 
A shaking has already begun in the financial world, and this shaking could easily become an avalanche. 
Now is not a time to party. Rather, it is time to batten down the hatches and to prepare for very rough seas ahead. 
All of the things that so many experts warned were coming may have been delayed slightly, but without a doubt they are still on the way. 
So get prepared while you still can, because time is running out.",1
20118,20118,The Trump Ploy,Linh Dinh,"Michele Paccione / Shutterstock.com 
Universally, Trump was depicted as an anti-establishment candidate. Washington and Wall Street hated him, and the media were deployed to vilify him endlessly. If they could not discredit Trump enough, surely they would steal the election from him. Some even suggested Trump would be assassinated. 
Acting the part, Trump charged repeatedly that the election was rigged, and he was right, of course. During the primaries, Hillary Clinton received debate questions in advance from CNN. More seriously, 30 states used voting machines that could easily be hacked. 
A leaked tape of Trump making obscene comments about groping women became further proof that the establishment was out to get him. In spite of all this, Trump managed to win by a landslide, so what happened? 
To steal an American election, one only needs to tamper with votes in two or three critical states, and since Hillary didn’t win, we must conclude that she was never the establishment’s chosen puppet. As Trump claimed, the fix was in, all right, except that it was rigged in his favor, as born out by the fact. 
While everybody else yelped that Trump would never be allowed to win, I begged to differ. After the Orlando false flag shooting on June 12th, 2016, I wrote: 
In 2008, Obama was touted as a political outsider who will hose away all of the rot and bloody criminality of the Bush years. He turned out to be a deft move by our ruling class. Though fools still refuse to see it, Obama is a perfect servant of our military banking complex. Now, Trump is being trumpeted as another political outsider. 
A Trump presidency will temporarily appease restless, lower class whites, while serving as a magnet for liberal anger. This will buy our ruling class time as they continue to wage war abroad while impoverishing Americans back home. Like Obama, Trump won’t fulfill any of his election promises, and this, too, will be blamed on bipartisan politics. 
On September 24th, I doubled down: 
Mind-fucked, most Americans can’t even see that an American president’s only task is to disguise the deep state’s intentions. Chosen by the deep state to explain away its crimes, our president’s pronouncements are nearly always contradicted by the deep state’s actions. While the president talks of peace, democracy, racial harmony, prosperity for Main Street and going after banksters, etc., the deep state wages endless war, stages meaningless elections, stokes racial hatred, bankrupts nearly all Americans and enables massive Wall Street crimes, etc. 
Only the infantile will imagine the president as any kind of savior or, even more hilariously, anti-establishment. Since the deep state won’t even tolerate a renegade reporter at, say, the San Jose Mercury News, how can you expect a deep state’s enemy to land in the White House?! It cannot happen. 
A presidential candidate will promise to fix all that’s wrong with our government, and this stance, this appearance, is actually very useful for the deep state, for it gives Americans hope. Promising everything, Obama delivered nothing. So who do you think is being primed by the deep state to be our next false savior? 
Who benefits from false flag terrorist attacks blamed on Muslims? Who gains when blacks riot? Why is the Democratic Party propping up a deeply-despised and terminally ill war criminal? More personable Bernie Sanders was nixed by the deep state since it had another jester in mind. 
The first presidential debate is Monday. Under stress, Hillary’s eyes will dart in separate directions. Coughing nonstop for 90 minutes, her highness will hack up a gazillion unsecured emails. Her head will jerk spasmodically, plop onto the floor and, though decapitated, continue to gush platitudes and lies. “A Very Impressive Performance,” CNBC and CNN will announce. Come November, though, Trump will be installed because his constituency needs to be temporarily pacified. The deep state knows that white people are pissed. 
The media were out to get Trump, pundits from across the political spectrum kept repeating, but the truth is that the media made Trump. Long before the election, Trump became a household name, thanks to the media. 
Your average American can’t name any other real estate developer, casino owner or even his own senators, but he has known Trump since forever. For more than a decade, Trump was a reality TV star, with two of his children also featured regularly on The Apprentice. Trump’s “You’re fired” and his hair became iconic. Trump appeared on talk shows, had cameo roles in movies and owned the Miss Universe pageant. In 2011, Obama joked that Trump as president would deck out the White House in garish fashion, with his own name huge on the façade. The suave, slick prez roasted Trump again in 2016. Trump has constantly been in the limelight. 
It’s true that during the presidential campaign, Trump received mostly negative press, but this only ramped up support among his core constituency. Joe Sixpacks had long seen the media as not just against everything they cherished, but against them as people, so the more the media attacked Trump, the more popular he became among the white working class. 
Like politicians, casinos specialize in empty promises. Trump, then, is a master hustler, just like Obama, and with help from the media, this New York billionaire became a darling of the flyover states. Before his sudden transformation, Trump was certainly an insider. He donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and Bill and Hillary attended his third wedding. Golf buddies, The Donald and Bill were also friends with one Jeffrey Epstein, owner of the infamous Lolita Express and a sex orgy, sex slave island in the Caribbean. 
In 2002, New York Magazine published “Jeffrey Epstein: International Money of Mystery.” This asskissing piece begins, “He comes with cash to burn, a fleet of airplanes, and a keen eye for the ladies—to say nothing of a relentless brain that challenges Nobel Prize-winning scientists across the country—and for financial markets around the world.” ORDER IT NOW 
Trump is quoted, “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it—Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” 
Bill Clinton shouts out, “Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science. I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating HIV/AIDS.” 
Epstein gushes back, “If you were a boxer at the downtown gymnasium at 14th Street and Mike Tyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign leaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world’s greatest politician.” 
Even during a very nasty election campaign, Trump stayed clear of Clinton’s association with Epstein because he himself had been chummy with the convicted pervert. Trump also never brought up the Clintons’ drug running in Mena or the many mysterious deaths of those whose existence inconvenienced their hold on power. 
With eight years in the White House, plus stints as a senator then secretary of state, Clinton is considered the ultimate insider. Though a novice politician, Trump is also an insider, and it’s a grand joke of the establishment that they’ve managed to convince Joe Sixpacks everywhere that Trump will save them. 
Knowing how angry the working class has become, the deep state could not install Hillary, for that would have been a tiresome rehash of another Clinton presidency. With NAFTA, Bill launched the job offshoring that has wrecked this country, and those most affected by it, working class whites, know damn well who’s responsible. The Clinton brand has become anathema to middle America. 
While Clinton says America is already great, Trump promises to make America great again, but the decline of the US will only accelerate. Our manufacturing base is handicapped because American workers will not put up with Chinese wages, insanely long hours or living in cramped factory dormitories. In a global economy, those who can suck it up best get the jobs. 
On the foreign front, America’s belligerence will not ease up under a Trump presidency, for without a hyper kinetic military to browbeat and bomb, the world will stop lending us money. The US doesn’t just wage wars to fatten the military banking complex, but to prop up the US Dollar and prevent our economy from collapsing. The empire yields tangible benefits for even the lowliest Americans. 
With his livelihood vaporized, the poor man does not care for LGBT rights, the glass ceiling or climate change. Supplementing his wretched income with frequent treks to the church pantry, if not blood bank, he needs immediate relief. It’s a shame he’s staking his hopes on an imposter. 
The deep state ushered in Trump because he’s clearly their most useful decoy. As the country hopes in vain, the crooked men behind the curtain will go on with business as usual. Trump is simply an Obama for a different demographic. Nothing will change for the better.

20119,20119,"G.O.P. Plans Immediate Repeal of Health Law, Then a Delay - The New York Times","Robert Pear, Jennifer Steinhauer and Thomas Kaplan","WASHINGTON  —   Republicans in Congress plan to move almost immediately next month to repeal the Affordable Care Act, as   Donald J. Trump promised. But they also are likely to delay the effective date so that they have several years to phase out President Obama’s signature achievement. This emerging “repeal and delay” strategy, which Speaker Paul D. Ryan discussed this week with Vice   Mike Pence, underscores a growing recognition that replacing the health care law will be technically complicated and could be politically explosive. Since the law was signed by Mr. Obama in March 2010, 20 million uninsured people have gained coverage, and the law has become deeply embedded in the nation’s health care system, accepted with varying degrees of enthusiasm by consumers, doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and state and local governments. Unwinding it could be as difficult for Republicans as it was for Democrats to pass it in the first place and could lead Republicans into a dangerous    where the existing law is in shambles but no replacement can pass the narrowly divided Senate. Democrats would face political pressure in that case as well. It is not sheer coincidence that at least one idea envisions putting the effective date well beyond the midterm congressional elections in 2018. “We are not going to rip health care away from Americans,” said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which shares jurisdiction over health care. “We will have a transition period so Congress can develop the right policies and the American people can have time to look for better health care options. ” Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said: “I imagine this will take several years to completely make that sort of transition  —   to make sure we do no harm, create a good health care system that everyone has access to, and that we repeal the parts of Obamacare that need to be repealed. ” But health policy experts suggest “repeal and delay” would be extremely damaging to a health care system already on edge. “The idea that you can repeal the Affordable Care Act with a   or   transition period and not create market chaos is a total fantasy,” said Sabrina Corlette, a professor at the Health Policy Institute of Georgetown University. “Insurers need to know the rules of the road in order to develop plans and set premiums. ” Details of the strategy are in flux, and there are disagreements among Republicans about how to proceed. In the House, the emerging plan, tightly coordinated between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Pence, is meant to give Mr. Trump’s supporters the repeal of the health law that he repeatedly promised at rallies. It would also give Republicans time to try to assure consumers and the health industry that they will not instantly upend the health insurance market, and to pressure some Democrats to support a Republican alternative. “I don’t think you have to wait,” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, told reporters this week. “I would move through and repeal and then go to work on replacing. I think once it’s repealed, you will have hopefully fewer people playing politics, and everybody coming to the table to find the best policy. ” Under the plan discussed this week, Republicans said, repeal will be on a fast track. They hope to move forward in January or February with a budget blueprint using   reconciliation instructions, which would allow parts of the health care law to be dismembered with a simple majority vote, denying Senate Democrats the chance to filibuster. They would follow up with legislation similar to a bill vetoed in January, which would have repealed the tax penalties for people who go without insurance and the penalties for larger employers who fail to offer coverage. That bill would also have eliminated federal insurance subsidies, ended federal spending for the expansion of Medicaid, and barred federal payments to Planned Parenthood clinics. But in the Senate, Republicans would need support from some Democrats if they are to replace the Affordable Care Act. The budget reconciliation rules that would allow Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act have strict limits. The rules are primarily intended to protect legislation that affects spending or revenues. The health law includes insurance market standards and other policies that do not directly affect the budget, and Senate Republicans would, in many cases, need 60 votes to change such provisions. Repealing the funding mechanisms but leaving in place the regulations risks a meltdown of the individual insurance market. Insurers could not deny coverage, but they would not get as many healthy new customers as they were expecting. Hospitals would again face many uninsured patients in their emergency rooms, without the extra Medicaid money they have been expecting. Even a delay of two to three years could be damaging. Health policy experts said the uncertainty could destabilize markets, unnerving insurers that have already lost hundreds of millions of dollars on policies sold in insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. “Insurers would like clarity on the shape of the replacement plan to continue participating on exchanges if Obamacare is repealed,” Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners who follows the insurance industry, said Friday. Republicans are hoping that Mr. Trump will be able to use his bully pulpit to lean on vulnerable Democrats up for   in states Mr. Trump won, such as Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. “When that date came and you did nothing, if you want to play politics, I think the blame would go to people who didn’t want to do anything,” Mr. McCarthy said. But Democrats may not be so quick to break. “If they are looking at fixing what’s there, I’ve been wanting to work with Republicans for years now,” said Mr. Tester, whose state cast just 36 percent of its vote for Hillary Clinton. “But if they are going to take away provisions like   conditions, lifetime caps,    I think they are barking up the wrong tree. ” And some moderate Republicans see peril in repealing first and replacing later, favoring instead a simultaneous replacement to ensure a smooth transition. “We are firing live rounds this time,” Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, said. “If we repeal under reconciliation, we have to replace it under normal processes, and does anyone believe that the Senate Democrats, with their gentle tender mercies will help us?” Republicans said they would work with the Trump administration on replacement legislation that would draw on comprehensive plans drafted by Mr. Ryan and Representative Tom Price, the Georgia Republican picked by Mr. Trump to be his secretary of health and human services. Any legislation is likely to include elements on which Republicans generally agree: tax credits for health insurance new incentives for health savings accounts subsidies for state   pools, to help people who could not otherwise obtain insurance authority for sales of insurance across state lines and some protection for people with   conditions who have maintained continuous coverage. Republicans said they hoped that the certainty of repeal would increase pressure on Democrats to sign on to some of these ideas. Democratic leaders, for now, feel no such pressure. Republicans “are going to have an awfully hard time” if they try to repeal the health law without proposing a replacement, said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the next Democratic leader. “There would be consequences for so many millions of people. ”",0
20120,20120,Saving Refugees on the Mediterranean: a Luxury Yacht With a New Purpose - The New York Times,Raphael Minder,"BARCELONA, Spain  —   A year ago, Oscar Camps, a Spaniard, was a lifeguard who traveled with a colleague to the Greek island of Lesbos to see what he could do to help as thousands of Syrian refugees washed up from Turkey. He had tried to volunteer for different European organizations and embassies, but was turned down, and arrived on the island with little more than swim fins. Mr. Camps said he had no idea how critical the situation in Lesbos had become. Within two hours of their arrival, he and his friend were taking off their shirts and shoes to jump into the sea to save people from drowning, after watching a boat sink close to the island’s rocky northern coast. Lesbos “changed my view on almost everything,” Mr. Camps recalled in a recent interview. “I realized that Europe’s inaction was absolutely deliberate  —   a decision by the European Union to use the Mediterranean and the Aegean as dissuasive tools, to send the message to people that they shouldn’t try to come because they would drown. ” The situation spurred him to action, and he decided to start his own nongovernmental aid group, Proactiva, through a crowdfunding campaign. Initially, he reused rickety vessels abandoned by refugees on the shores of Lesbos, and he invested 15, 000 euros, or about $16, 600, himself to buy equipment, as well as to bring two Jet Skis to Lesbos from Spain. But a big break came last May, when Livio Lo Monaco, the Italian owner of a Spanish mattress company, donated his yacht, the Astral. Since it started prowling the Mediterranean, the repurposed luxury sailing yacht has helped rescue about 15, 000 refugees and migrants trying to reach Europe by boat, mostly from Libya, Mr. Camps estimated. The Astral’s work has made Mr. Camps something of a celebrity in Spain, as well as the subject of a recent documentary film that helped raise funds for his organization, which now has an annual budget of about €1 million. He is due to travel to New York in November after his group was nominated for two separate awards for its humanitarian work. The Astral was originally built in 1970 by Philip Rhodes, a top yacht designer, and initially sailed by Cornelius Vanderstar, the owner of an aluminum company. Mr. Camps and his team have refitted the boat and stripped it of its luxury elements. Today it is operated by a team of volunteer lifeguards and doctors, and uses two dinghies in its    missions. It is designed to take about 60 refugees on board, but carries 600 life jackets. The boat’s crew helped save about 6, 000 people in the Mediterranean on a single day last summer, Mr. Camps said. Before jumping into the waters off Lesbos, Mr. Camps, 52, had already built a successful private company of lifeguards, monitoring beaches in four regions of Spain. He also has another business that supplies showers, watchtowers and other beach furniture. Mr. Camps decided to set up his own lifeguard company after standing among a group of helpless lifeguards, who could only watch from the beach as a teenager drowned off one of Barcelona’s beaches in 1993. The accident occurred in part because of unfamiliar sea currents, Mr. Camps said, resulting from the breakwater infrastructure added for the Olympics that Barcelona hosted the previous summer. At the time, Mr. Camps was working for the Red Cross. “I realized on that terrible day that sea rescue in Spain had to become a lot more professional,” Mr. Camps said. Spain was in the midst of a tourism boom, he added, “but we continued to believe that huge responsibilities could be handled only by volunteers. ” Mr. Camps said he sought to follow “the American model,” drawing on advice from the Los Angeles lifeguards. He is now back in touch with lifeguards in Los Angeles and Hawaii to see whether they can contribute to his work with refugees in the Mediterranean. “I want the Astral to be the flagship of human rights on the sea, but the needs are immense,” he said. In fact, Mr. Camps is hoping another rescue vessel will be donated to his group soon. The Astral’s rescue efforts have highlighted not only the scale of the catastrophe but also the failure of European governments to respond adequately, Mr. Camps said. More than 3, 500 people are estimated to have drowned this year while trying to reach southern Europe, even after each paid traffickers hundreds of dollars to guarantee a safe passage. On Nov. 3, two more shipwrecks left another 239 migrants missing at sea. Mr. Camps, however, claimed that European governments “are constantly lying about the number of dead,” notably by refusing to include in their estimates those believed to have disappeared at sea. When dealing with a boat sinking, “it’s pretty meaningless to use only the number of bodies found,” he argued. But for European countries, the scale of the problem and the policy calculus is not an easy one. Several photojournalists have recently traveled on the Astral, helping raise awareness of the tragedy at sea. Mr. Camps said he was at times shocked by the “media circus” generated by Europe’s refugee crisis, but he also acknowledged that it was thanks to such media coverage that he and others first heard about the chaos in Lesbos. Underlining this paradoxical situation, he recalled one occasion in Lesbos when “you had nine guys with cameras around one of my lifeguards who was saving a child, and nobody was helping but all were just taking photos. ” Unless the European Union resumes a   rescue program like Mare Nostrum, which was masterminded and funded by Italy, drownings are likely to rise significantly, Mr. Camps predicted, particularly if European land borders stay closed, pushing more refugees to cross by boat or dinghy. “The sea is being converted into an extermination center, with a lot of people dying and nobody really knowing how many,” Mr. Camps said. “The sea is like a carpet that governments are now lifting to brush underneath their dirt. ”",0
20121,20121,WikiLeaks Podesta Emails Confirm Hillary’s Health Issues,Emily Pont,"We Are Change 
Issues surrounding Hillary Clinton’s health and ability to take on the demanding position of President have pervaded this presidential race. But several recent WikiLeaks emails from John Podesta, chairman of Hillary’s campaign, have revealed that Hillary Clinton’s health problems cannot possibly be branded as “conspiracy theories” any longer.

Before Hillary Clinton announced her run for president, an email sent on March 14th, 2014, by campaign manager Robert Mook to Clinton campaign chairman Podesta asks whether Podesta has discussed Hillary’s “taxes and health.” The email states that he acknowledges they’re both “hyper sensitive” issues, wondering whether “both are better dealt with very early so we control them–rather than responding to calls for transparency.” 
In this thread, Mook stated “Yes. We need to kill that baby in the cradle.” (Which perfectly articulates how sadistic the Clinton campaign and agenda is within a single metaphor.)
A later email thread from July 31, 2015 , shows Dan Schwerin, Clinton’s director of speech writing, aiming to roll out Hillary’s tax records along with a letter from her physician stating that she is “in excellent health,” and that following this “We expect the stories that pop at 2 pm to have headlines such as “CLINTON IN ‘EXCELLENT HEALTH,’ MEDICAL RECORDS SAY” … “CLINTON RELEASES HEALTH REPORT” … “CLINTON CAMP AIMS TO ONE-UP BUSH IN DISCLOSING FINANCES”
The emails expose the Clinton campaign’s attempts to suppress any further inquiry into these health problems and control the narrative, and provide them with “the best possible, ‘fighting’ chance of promoting the most helpful story lines.”
Also stating that “the first stories on health won’t pop until 2. 1 pm is just when we will quietly approach the reporters, ” the Clinton camp is exposed in the way in which the mainstream media has held complete bias in favor of a Clinton presidency. This has also been revealed through all the recent Podesta email Wikileaks releases. Just one example being an email sent April 30, 2015, by Politico reporter Glenn Thrush, who even called himself a “hack” when asking Hillary’s top campaign aide, John Podesta, to check over sections of his report regarding the Democratic presidential candidate before publication. 

Startlingly, an email exchange between Hillary’s campaign leaders, Tanden and Podesta, even questions if she is aware that we are living on planet Earth. Telling an audience in Ohio that she was “moderate and center” after previously stating just a few days prior that she was “progressive”, Tanden asks, “Why did she call herself a moderate?”
Podesta replied “ I pushed her on this on Sunday night. She claims she didn’t remember saying it. Not sure I believe her.” 
In response, Tanden stated, “I mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter I know she’s actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues. It worries me more that she doesn’t seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment. ” 
It can be speculated as to what this statement is referring to, but it is evident that this proves Hillary’s lack of awareness and mental stability. Perhaps regarding her inability to hold a firm political position, or even more worryingly, her inability to retain even the most basic and fundamental information, due to a medical condition that she is suffering from. Giving credibility to the latter possibility, Hillary’s top aide Huma Abedin admits that the former Secretary of State is “still not perfect in her head,” in a newly revealed Wikileaks email on Tuesday.
Countless incidents capturing Hillary’s poor health and unstable mental state have been brought to light, despite the Clinton campaign and mainstream media’s attempted censoring of this content in the hope that portraying a false narrative regarding these episodes will stray attention away from this issue. For example, after Hillary’s recent fall at a 9/11 memorial event filmed by a bystander, the Clinton campaign tried to cover up by claiming this was due to “pneumonia and dehydration” even though Clinton does not appear limp, as though she has fainted. In contrast, she appears ridged and shaky throughout this episode, as Secret Service agents lift her into the vehicle. However, Hillary’s constant tumbles do not surprise me, as the gravitational force pulling this Democratic nominee towards underworld must be so incredibly strong.
This along with many other recently recorded accounts of Hillary’s severe coughing fits , dangerous falls, recurring eye problems , and the spitting up of a vile yellow substance, have undoubtedly shown that this presidential candidate is scarcely physically fit to perform duties as president. Hillary’s mental state is also a major point of concern, which top aides, Podesta and Abedin, have confirmed through the Wikileaks emails stated in this article.
If Hillary blatantly appears unable to function healthily during her time running for president, we can only expect these issues to increase in severity if she were to take on the stressful position of president.

20122,20122,Anna Kendrick: Movie Star. Twitter Star. Ready for More. - The New York Times,Kathryn Shattuck,"Anna Kendrick is the kind of actor who likes to cut to the chase. “If I’m working with a director who wants to be   or whatever, that’s fine,” said Ms. Kendrick, who since March has promoted six films while amusing her nearly 5. 8 million Twitter followers. “But I am happy as a clam when we’re just focused and prepared and ready to shoot. ” In “The Accountant,” opening Friday, Oct. 14, she plays a financial type at a robotics corporation who spots a discrepancy requiring the expertise of an enigmatic mathematics savant, played by Ben Affleck. What she doesn’t know is that he crunches numbers for international criminal organizations out of a strip mall. And has    firearm skills. Ms. Kendrick found a kindred spirit in Mr. Affleck, whose filmmaker’s sensibility and straightforward approach helped turn the set of Gavin O’Connor’s thriller  —   a sort of “A Beautiful Mind” for the C. P. A. crowd  —   into a model of efficiency. “When it came down to it, he was very practical about how we were going to basically get our scenes in the can,” she said. In a recent interview from Los Angeles, where she was scrambling to catch a flight to London, Ms. Kendrick, 31, pondered her very busy year, including DreamWorks’ “Trolls” and a memoir, “Scrappy Little Nobody,” both out next month. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. You’ve been all over the place recently. I made a lot of movies in the last couple of years, and they’re all coming out right now. I’m sorry that I’m oversaturating my own market. But by next year, there will be at least a year of not, like, constantly my face in everybody’s business. Was this your first introduction to Ben? We had met years ago, and he was seated next to me and had not brought his glasses or worn his contacts and was asking me who everybody was. And then I pointed out the Jonas Brothers and had to explain to him who the Jonas Brothers were. You spent the last year writing a book. How did you land that gig? An editor approached me because they thought I was funny on Twitter, and then I wrote this piece in Vogue about the Oscars, and somebody went, “Well, I guess if she wrote one article, she can write a book. ” Apparently people are allowed to make decisions like that. And these are essays? “Essays” is giving me too much credit. That makes it sound like I’m Alexander Hamilton or something. Basically the idea was all the funny stories I wanted to put on Twitter but couldn’t reduce to 140 characters. I’m definitely amazed that writers can create things on a continual basis because I feel like my brain will never been the same. I feel like it drained my life power. Where did the title come from? From a conversation I had with my brother, wondering if I’m still the same person that I was when I moved to Los Angeles and the worry that I was becoming complacent in my life. He assured me that I was still scrappy and still had a little   person inside of me.  ? I’m very small, so I’ve spent my life trying to talk louder and be stronger to overcome that. That’s a quality that some people might think is objectionable, but I’m kind of proud of it, so that’s a quality that I’d like to retain. In “Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,” you played a crazy party gal opposite your BFF Aubrey Plaza. Was that a stretch? There are aspects of my personality that are a little persnickety, I guess one could say. But I do think that I play   characters more than it makes sense in my brain. Like, it’s a surprise that people keep asking me to play professional women, because I’m like, are you looking at the same person? This person is the person you want to play really professional and driven? I’m falling apart. You’re falling apart? Oh, yeah.",0
20123,20123,Rigging the Election – Video IV: Democrat Operatives Willfully Accepting Illegal Foreign Donations,Lee Rogers,"Rigging the Election – Video IV: Democrat Operatives Willfully Accepting Illegal Foreign Donations 
Lee Rogers Daily Stormer October 26, 2016 
Project Veritas has released a new video, part IV of their “Rigging the Election” series, which shows footage of Democrat operatives willfully accepting what was presented as a $20,000 donation from a foreign source. This is more documented evidence of criminal activity by these characters. It is against the law to accept foreign donations in this capacity. 
The foreign source was actually working under cover with Project Veritas. They ended up wiring $20,000 from a Belize bank that the Democrats happily accepted. Once they received the money they started having discussions with the undercover man about granting special access, etc. 
What makes the whole thing interesting is that they only returned the $20,000 after they realized that their operations had been infiltrated. It shows that under normal circumstances, they have no issue with accepting foreign donations even though it is against the law. 
So far, Project Veritas has released video evidence documenting Democrat conspiracies to commit vote fraud, conspiracies to agitate violence and a willingness to accept illegal political contributions from foreigners. Then you have all the Wikileaks stuff that has been dumped. This entire operation surrounding Hillary Clinton is about as corrupt as you can get. 
It looks as if Project Veritas is slowly working their way up the Democrat food chain in these videos. While this might be wishful thinking, I hope they have damning footage of Hillary Clinton that they’ll dump at a time to cause maximum political damage. I guess we’ll see.",1

The University of Michigan’s new chief diversity officer will collect $385,000 a year under his various job titles, including a new one created by a recently revealed $85 million, five-year U-M diversity plan . 
Robert Sellers’ appointment to a new position called “vice provost for equity and inclusion and chief diversity officer” (VPEI-CDO) was approved Oct. 20 by the university’s governing board. Sellers previously served as “vice provost for equity and inclusion,” and is also listed as a professor of both psychology and education. In 2014-15 Sellers was paid $347,295 in his capacity as vice provost, a position created in 2014. 
President Mark Schlissel nominated Sellers for the job several weeks ago. The new full-time administrative position “will serve as a leadership voice on diversity, equity and inclusion for the entire university.” 
The diversity plan Sellers will oversee will spend $17 million a year over the next five years. It seeks to “recruit, retain and develop a diverse university community” and “support innovation and inclusive scholarship and teaching” through a number of new and expanded programs. 
The $85 million plan is in addition to the $40 million a year the university already spends promoting diversity.

20125,20125,"Zsa Zsa Gabor, Actress Famous for Her Glamour (and Her Marriages), Dies at 99 - The New York Times",Robert D. McFadden,"Zsa Zsa Gabor, the Hungarian actress whose   glamour and   marriages to millionaires put a luster of American celebrity on a long but only modestly successful career in movies and television, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. She was 99. The cause was heart failure, her longtime publicist Edward Lozzi said. Married at least eight times, calling everyone “Dahlink,” flaunting a    lifestyle and abetted by gossip columnists and tabloid headline writers, Ms. Gabor played the coifed platinum femme fatale in plunging necklines in dozens of film and television roles, many of them cameos as herself. Her career, which began with the title Miss Hungary in 1936, was still going strong in the 1990s, outlasting those of her sisters, Eva and Magda, celebrities in their own right. She was the last surviving Gabor sister. “A girl must marry for love, and keep on marrying until she finds it,” Ms. Gabor once said. Her husbands included a Turkish diplomat, the hotel heir Conrad Hilton, the actor George Sanders, an industrialist, an oil magnate, a toy designer, a divorce lawyer and a man often referred to in the news media as the Duke of Saxony. Another marriage that nobody counted  —   a case of bigamy at sea with a   Mexican actor  —   lasted only a day and was annulled. In 1989, she was arrested for slapping a police officer who had pulled her over for a traffic violation and found that her license had expired and that she had an open vodka bottle in her car, a   Corniche convertible. Breezing into court, she took the stand and, by turns haughty, coquettish, weepy and coarse, spoke of Gestapo tactics in Beverly Hills. The judge gave her 72 hours in jail. “You just cannot drive a   in Beverly Hills anymore, because they have it in for you,” she said after things had blown over. Ms. Gabor appeared in more than 60 television movies and feature films, mostly   although some were Italian, French, German and Australian. Critics said her best roles were early in her career, in “Moulin Rouge” (1952) and “Lili” (1953). She also appeared as a nightclub manager in Orson Welles’s 1958 classic “Touch of Evil” and, the same year, as a sexy alien in “Queen of Outer Space,” a camp favorite about virile American astronauts landing on a planet populated by scantily clad women. From the 1950s into the ’90s, she was also on scores of television programs: talk shows, game shows, comedy specials, westerns, episodic dramas. On the 1960s series “Batman,” she played the   Minerva, whose mineral spa fleeced swells by extracting secrets from their brains. “A real vicked voman,” she described the character in her Hungarian accent. Exploiting her naughty celebrity, Ms. Gabor, with the help of collaborators and ghost writers, published four books: “Zsa Zsa Gabor: My Story” (1960) “Zsa Zsa’s Complete Guide to Men” (1969) “How to Catch a Man, How to Keep a Man, How to Get Rid of a Man” (1970) and “One Lifetime Is Not Enough” (1991). In addition to her steady appearances in movies and on television, Ms. Gabor operated a   cosmetics company. She once offered $1 million to anyone who could prove she had had a  . In 1974, she bought a villa in Bel Air built by Howard Hughes and formerly owned by Elvis Presley. Her multitiered clothes closet  —   30 feet long, 12 feet deep and 14 feet high  —   contained 5, 000 garments that, except for favored gowns, were given to charities and replaced with a new wardrobe from time to time, according to her official fan site, zsazsagabor. org. In early 2009, Ms. Gabor discovered that she had joined a long list of celebrities who were victimized by Bernard L. Madoff, the financial swindler whose worldwide Ponzi scheme that cost investors tens of billions. Her lawyer Chris Fields said she lost at least $7 million and possibly as much as $10 million. Ms. Gabor had been in and out of hospitals for years. She suffered head and other injuries and was hospitalized for a month in 2002 after a car driven by her hairdresser struck a utility pole in West Hollywood. It left her in a wheelchair, and she retreated from the spotlight. She suffered a stroke in 2005 and had surgery for a blocked carotid artery. In 2007, she again underwent surgery to treat a leg infection and aftereffects of the stroke. In July 2010, she underwent   surgery after a fall at her home in which she also suffered a concussion. Released from the hospital in August, she was readmitted two days later for treatment of unspecified complications. In January 2011, her right leg was amputated above the knee after an infection proved resistant to antibiotics. Doctors said the operation was necessary to save her life. Two months later, shock over the death of her friend Elizabeth Taylor sent her to the hospital with high blood pressure, and Ms. Gabor’s publicist, John Blanchette, quoted her as saying she feared she was next. In November 2011, she had emergency surgery after blood began flowing through a feeding tube inserted in her stomach. Born Sari Gabor in Budapest in 1917  —   she always gave a birth date of Feb. 6 or 7, but not the year, though Mr. Lozzi confirmed on Sunday that it was 1917  —   Ms. Gabor grew up in relative prosperity, the second of three daughters of Vilmos and Jolie Gabor. Raised for stardom, the sisters attended private schools and were chauffeured to acting, dancing, music and fencing classes. On the eve of World War II, Ms. Gabor, her mother and her sisters emigrated to the United States, and by the 1950s the Gabor sisters had become as well known for their love lives as for their careers. Magda, who acted on radio briefly and helped her mother operate a chain of jewelry boutiques, died in 1997, as did her mother. Eva, who was best known for her role on television’s “Green Acres” in the 1960s  —   and whom the public sometimes confused with Zsa Zsa  —   died in 1995. Zsa Zsa, who divorced seven of her eight husbands, was first married to Burhan Belge, a Turkish diplomat in Budapest, from 1937 to 1941. Her second marriage, to Mr. Hilton, lasted from 1942 to 1947. Their daughter, Francesca Hilton, an actress, was Ms. Gabor’s only child. She died in 2015. Her other marriages were to Mr. Sanders ( ) who later married Magda Gabor the   Herbert L. Hutner ( ) the oil magnate Joshua S. Cosden Jr. ( ) Jack Ryan, an inventor and toy designer who helped create the Barbie doll ( ) Michael O’Hara, a lawyer ( ) and Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, whom she married in 1986. Mr. Prinz von Anhalt, often described in the news media as a prince or the Duke of Saxony, was born Hans Robert Lichtenberg, the son of a police officer in Germany. He changed his name to include what sounded like a title after Princess Marie Auguste of Anhalt, the Duchess of Saxony, adopted him in 1980 as an adult. The adoption, widely reported to have been a business transaction, conferred only an illusion of nobility, reinforced by the name change. Some biographies of Ms. Gabor also mention a 1983 marriage to Felipe de Alba, a lawyer who appeared in films in Mexico in the 1940s and ’50s, but Ms. Gabor said it lasted only a day. The ceremony was performed by a ship’s captain at sea but was probably illegal because the ship was not in international waters, and Ms. Gabor was technically not yet divorced from Mr. O’Hara. It was later annulled, just to make sure. There were also notorious affairs with Porfirio Rubirosa, the Dominican playboy, and with Rafael Trujillo Jr. the son of the Dominican dictator. Ms. Gabor is survived by her husband, Mr. Prinz von Anhalt. Ms. Gabor’s many public appearances included a 1987 address to the American Bar Association convention in San Francisco, where she spoke to the family law section at a    luncheon. “We’ve had enough of the routine speakers,” the chairman said, introducing Ms. Gabor as “an optimist who still believes in marriage. ” Telling her tales of marital joys and woes, Ms. Gabor confided, “I have learned that not diamonds but divorce lawyers are a girl’s best friend. ” Then, inviting questions, the chairman said, “Let’s keep it on direct, not on cross. ” “What does that mean?” she asked. “That means they’ve got to be nice to you. ”",0
20126,20126,"Pursuing a Dream in Film, With Tips From Spike Lee - The New York Times",Vincent M. Mallozzi,"Jazmyn Benjamin walked onto the hardwood floor at Madison Square Garden to a symphony of squeaking soles. She made her way through a maze of tall men in tailored sweatsuits rehearsing beneath a basket, to a spot that signified a turning point in her life. “I was standing right here back in 2009 when I interviewed Estelle,” she said, referring to the British singer and songwriter, shortly before the start of a New York Knicks basketball game last week. “I was so nervous that day because she was such a big celebrity, and I was just a    kid in the program. ” Ms. Benjamin  —   now a    senior at Brooklyn College majoring in film production who hopes, she said, “to become the next influential film director”  —   was referring to her days as a student in the MSG Classroom program, which teaches children about jobs in television, including announcing, producing, directing and creating graphics. In 2009, Ms. Benjamin was living with her mother and two younger siblings in a homeless shelter. Things began to brighten when she was one of 10 children from   neighborhoods selected to participate in the Hope Leadership Academy. The academy is run by the Children’s Aid Society, one of the eight agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The Children’s Aid Society also provided $300 to Ms. Benjamin to buy clothes to wear during interview assignments and college visits. The academy worked with the Garden of Dreams Foundation, a nonprofit that helps children facing obstacles, to form the MSG Classroom program, which allows students to use Madison Square Garden as a laboratory of sorts. Program members are free to interview MSG employees and officials players with the Knicks, the New York Rangers and the New York Liberty and celebrity guests booked by MSG Entertainment. “That experience is what motivated me to want to become the next Martin Scorsese, the next Quentin Tarantino, the next Spike Lee,” Ms. Benjamin said. “There aren’t nearly as many female directors out there, so I would love to break through and contribute my own artistic vision to the industry. And if that means directing a drama or a horror flick or a cheesy romantic comedy, it really doesn’t matter. I just want the opportunity to put my own creative stamp on something. ” Having long recognized Ms. Benjamin’s desire to become a director, program officials gave her the chance to meet Mr. Lee, an avid Knicks fan. His directorial skills, Ms. Benjamin said, “changed the film game in a lot of ways. ” The meeting took place during halftime at the Knicks game against the Oklahoma City Thunder last Monday, when Ms. Benjamin was escorted to a section of courtside seats where she found Mr. Lee chatting with the comedian Chris Rock. Mr. Lee immediately invited Ms. Benjamin over, and wasted no time offering her valuable advice. “The easiest way to break into this business is to be a   with a hyphen,” he said. “How are your writing skills? Do you keep a journal? Do you write down your story ideas every single day? Just keep writing. ” Mr. Lee became animated when Ms. Benjamin said to him, “When you came along, you did a lot of things that were new at the time, and now it sometimes feels as if everything has already been done. ” “That’s not true,” he said. “There’s a whole new world of cinema yet to be discovered, and we need more female directors like yourself out there trying to find it. So keep believing in yourself and do not let anyone discourage you from telling a story you want to tell. That’s just noise that you don’t want to hear. ” Mr. Lee offered one more directorial tip. “Always remember that a good director needs to be surrounded by very good actors, because the best actors might bring something extra or new to a role that you never expected,” he said. “You’ll find that out one day when you’re directing Denzel. ” When their conversation ended, Mr. Lee invited Ms. Benjamin to spend a day on the set of his coming Netflix show, “She’s Gotta Have It,” named for Mr. Lee’s first movie, released in 1986. The series is being filmed in Brooklyn. “Oh my goodness,” Ms. Benjamin said, her smile widening. “That would be amazing. ” Andrea Greenberg, president and chief executive of the television company MSG Networks, which runs the program, and a board member of the Garden of Dreams Foundation, said that Ms. Benjamin was “just one example of the   impact and effect the foundation has on our kids, which is something we pride ourselves on  —   and we are very proud of Jazmyn. ” So is Ms. Benjamin’s mother, Monica, who watched as Mr. Lee held court with her daughter. “What an amazing night,” said the elder Ms. Benjamin, who now lives with her three children in an apartment of their own in West Harlem. “Jazmyn is a very artistic person who has impressed me with a few film projects she has directed at school,” she said. “She’s always looking for that different camera angle, always trying new and creative things, and in that regard, she’s a lot like Spike. ”",0

In a mass mailing (also on their website ), the Marxist group divulges their support for Communist Bernie Sanders and explains in part: This country needs a real political revolution. Millions of people feel entirely disenfranchised by a political system that delivered the least favorable and trusted candidates in U.S. history. Many hoped that the Bernie Sanders campaign would represent a new direction and opportunity to take on entrenched power and extreme inequality, for a higher minimum wage, to defend Social Security, rebuild the labor movement, provide universal health care and free tuition. That campaign was largely suppressed, but its end does not change the desires and aspirations of tens of millions of people, workers and youth in particular, who are demanding real change. On Inauguration Day, thousands will be in the streets to give voice to the millions of people in this country who are demanding systemic change.

20128,20128,Indians Rush Frantically to Launder Their ‘Black Money’ - The New York Times,Geeta Anand,"MUMBAI, India  —   Indians’ ingenuity is being mightily tested as they rush to save their “black money,” stashes of hundreds of thousands, even millions, of rupees they have accumulated without paying taxes. For decades, Indians have stuffed their mattresses with   and   notes, the most widely circulated bills, worth the equivalent of a few dollars. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted to tax that money. His strategy was to force Indians to reveal what they had been hoarding. How? He banned the bills and told people that they had to exchange them for new ones. The ban, which was announced on Nov. 8, has thrown the economy into chaos and sent Indians on a desperate search for some way, any way, to launder their accumulated money and avoid a financially disastrous loss. People can exchange the banned notes through the end of the year for smaller denominations or new bills that are being created. Because more affluent Indians are allowed to deposit only 250, 000 rupees, or about $3, 700, without proof that they paid taxes, some are handing wads of cash to poor people, paying them a fee to hold the money in their accounts and return it later. Others are thronging jewelry stores and designer boutiques, carrying suitcases of banned currency notes, begging to buy something with backdated receipts. “People felt, rather than turn my money into toilet paper, let me have a beautiful outfit,” Tina Tahiliani Parikh, the executive director of the Ensemble group of   Indian fashion stores, said in an interview. Some have thrown in the towel, rather than risking an investigation into their taxes, filling pillowcases and paper bags with the old currency and dumping them in the trash. Notes of 1, 000 rupees, the equivalent of about $15, have been spotted floating down the Ganges River. About a third of all business in India is carried out using black money. Whole industries, like real estate, trading, luxury retailing and wedding services, have been fueled by black money for decades. They have slumped. Indians line up for hours in a quest for the   notes that they are allowed to receive in exchange at banks and the 2, 500 rupees that they can withdraw from A. T. M.s each day to pay for necessities. They often wait hours only to find that the bank or A. T. M. has run out of notes, which are scarce because the new ones are still being printed. The Supreme Court of India on Friday refused to block cases being brought in lower courts challenging Mr. Modi’s currency ban. The court said that people were frantic, and that the cases were a sign of a serious problem. The chairman of the Indian Banks’ Association said on Friday that all of the nation’s banks would limit the exchange of banned notes to older citizens and their own customers on Saturday so the staff could focus on normal banking. To a certain extent, analysts say, the Indian economy is so dependent on black money that economic dislocation was unavoidable if India was to seriously attack the problem. “In an emerging market economy like India, where corruption was deep rooted and long lasting, there is no way to put in place reform without significant disruption in the short run,” said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University. A Mumbai novelist, Namita Devidayal, in a Times of India column  last week, described the efforts by many of India’s wealthy women to salvage “those happy little bundles which she would whip out of her cupboard safe. ” Some were trying to pay their maids a year’s salary upfront, using the old notes, which the maids could ostensibly convert to new currency at the bank because the total was under the $3, 700 limit. Others were paying for a year’s hairdressing services in the old notes. Still others were pressing personal trainers, yoga teachers and children’s tutors to take cash upfront for months of services. Ms. Devidayal argued in an interview that the wealthy were “always trying to find some bargain by saving on taxes” and were by far the biggest exploiters of the   system. “I know wealthy women so used to handling cash they can tell how much money there is by the weight of a bundle,” she said. Ms. Parikh said some customers had shown up with suitcases of cash, beseeching her staff to pretend that the purchases were made days earlier, which the staff refused to do. Some other luxury goods stores not only obliged customers but solicited them, sensing an opportunity, Ms. Parikh said. “Everyone has tricks up their sleeves, backdating bills,” she said. Real estate has been particularly hard hit by the ban on black money, since sale documents filed with the government typically reflect only the portion of the sale price paid by check. As a result, the sellers have no way of explaining to the tax authorities how they received the cash, which can account for as much as 60 percent of the deal. People who had just sold property were particularly out of luck, since they have not had a chance to spend or invest the cash they received. One man who had just received 3. 5 million rupees, or about $51, 000, in a real estate sale said he was hiring 14   people to deposit the 250, 000 rupees in old notes that they are allowed to put into their accounts without raising questions. Such tactics, called bundling, are illegal in the United States. Whether these schemes are successful will depend on the scrutiny of bank officials and the tax authorities. The Modi administration has said it will exercise extreme vigilance to prevent them, but the Indian government’s record in the area of corruption is not strong. Nevertheless, the pledge to crack down has ignited such fear of future income tax investigations that some people have been dumping cash. Several garbage pickers in Mumbai have found pillow cases and sacks filled with cash in recent days, said Saumya Roy, the chief executive of the nonprofit Vandana Foundation, which makes loans to the garbage pickers, among other   residents in Mumbai and elsewhere. In a country where government oversight is weak, it has been easy to transact business in cash and to avoid taxes. Paying cash was also a way of avoiding the scrutiny of tax authorities who might question where a family, particularly that of a politician or wealthy business owner, had amassed the resources to spend enormous amounts of money on real estate or a wedding. “India is so crazy and complicated,” Ms. Devidayal said. “The option of not having black money is very much there, but because it’s so habitual and easy, and you can just say, ‘I had to do it,’ many people did. ” Cash had become so ingrained in the real estate industry that it was difficult to make a deal without paying some portion under the table. When Ramanan Laxminarayan, a Princeton University senior research scholar, tried to buy an apartment in the New Delhi area, he was told that he would have to provide 60 percent of the purchase price, about $420, 000, in cash to close the deal. Unable to raise such sums, he gave up trying to buy. “I said, ‘Is it legal?’ They said, ‘Of course not,’” Mr. Laxminarayan said. India’s lavish weddings have taken a big hit. Families that had stashed large amounts of black money to spend in the coming wedding season, which starts in December, are scrambling to make contingency plans. “This whole business is largely in cash,” from the caterer and musicians to the jeweler and ornate saris, said Satish Arora, a caterer and decorator in Faridabad, a city near Delhi. Several marriages planned for   hotels have been downscaled, he said. Now, the best many can manage is “a simple joint reception. ” The luxury goods market also has been flattened. Business at some of Ms. Parikh’s Ensemble shops has dropped 60 percent since Mr. Modi announced his ban, she said. “We don’t know what will be normal in the future,” she said.",0

20130,20130,Death Spiral: Aetna Exits Obamacare Exchanges Citing $700 Million in Losses - Breitbart,Sean Moran,"Health insurance giant Aetna said it will exit all Obamacare exchanges in 2018, citing significant losses. [The health insurance company announced it will withdraw from its two remaining exchanges in Delaware and Nebraska next year.  TJ Crawford, an Aetna spokesman, said, “Our individual commercial products lost nearly $700 million between 2014 and 2016, and are projected to lose more than $200 million in 2017 despite a significant reduction in membership. ” Crawford said that Obamacare’s structural issues “have led to   failures and carrier exits, and subsequent deterioration. ” Aetna announced earlier that would it would pull out its Iowa and Virginia exchanges as well. Insurers, including Aetna, lost money on the Obamacare exchanges because not enough young people signed up for insurance on the public exchanges to offset the cost of older and sicker individuals. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said in a statement on Wednesday that Aetna’s move “adds to the mountain of evidence that Obamacare has failed the American people. Repealing and replacing it with   solutions that stabilize the marketplace to bring down costs and increase choices is the only solution. ” The Obamacare exchanges are facing lower engagement. Humana announced it will be dropping out of the exchanges in 2018. Other major insurers such as Anthem and Cigna will soon decide their future participation in the Obamacare exchanges. Aetna chief executive Mark Bertolini said that Obamacare is on a “death spiral. ” Molina Healthcare suffered a significant loss on the federal exchanges and will be evaluating its future participation in the exchanges on a state by state basis for 2018. Aetna will exit the Obamacare exchanges amidst an uncertain future for health care. The House passed a revised version of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and now the Senate will take up health care reform. House Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows, who successfully brokered a deal with moderate Republicans on the House bill, will now work with Senate colleagues on a “grand compromise” for health care. Republicans seek to use the news of Aetna’s withdrawal as a reason for repealing large sections of Obamacare, whereas Democrats argued that Republicans’ repeal efforts create uncertainty in the health insurance market, forcing insurers to exit the exchanges. President Donald Trump, citing Aetna’s withdrawal from the Virginia exchanges, also says that Obamacare is in a “death spiral. ” Death spiral! ’Aetna will exit Obamacare markets in VA in 2018, citing expected losses on INDV plans this year’https:  .   —   Donald J.

20132,20132,"PINKERTON: The Fate of Obamacare in the Trump Era -- What the Middle Class Wants, It Will Get",James P. Pinkerton,"In the first installment of this series, we explored the past fight over Obamacare and the coming fight over Trumpcare.  Of course, it will be a while before we know exactly what Trumpcare will look like the details are still being worked out. [Second in a series  …        And yet even now, we can make a general prediction:  When all is said and done, the Trumpcare that replaces Obamacare will reflect the interests of Trump voters, and the middle class.  It will thus be different from past efforts, coming from both sides of the aisle, to devise a workable form of health insurance.    1. The New Republican Party  So now let’s start by taking a look at the Trump vote and, more broadly, the middle class.  As President Donald Trump likes to say, he’s the messenger of a movement, and here are some key facts about that movement —  specifically, about the 62, 980, 160 Americans who voted for Trump. The most obvious point is that the   GOP is no longer —  if it ever was —  the “party of the rich. ”  Even Democrats, if they are honest, have to admit that much.  Indeed, there’s been something of a   inversion in our national politics.      So Republican officeholders might do well to look closely at their voters, including the many new GOP voters.  In 2016, of the 10 states (including the District of Columbia) with the highest median income, nine voted for Hillary Clinton.  Conversely, of the 10 states with the lowest median income, nine voted for Trump.  We can pause to note that Trump voters themselves are typically not impoverished, and yet, many of them live in relatively poor states, where they find themselves sandwiched in the middle.  According to the nationwide 2016 exit poll, Clinton won the poor, as well as the rich, while Trump won those in between.   And it’s this Middle America, of course, that feels most besieged.  As Trump said in his January 20 inaugural address, it’s because of globalization that “the wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world. ” Indeed, the effects of globalization, which have favored the few and hurt the many, are stark: According to a   study by the liberal Brookings Institution, the 472 counties that Clinton carried last year accounted for 64 percent of the nation’s wealth, while the 2584 counties that Trump carried accounted for the remaining 36 percent.  And the people in those “blue dots” know who’s been good to them.  Thus it was, for instance, that Clinton got 84 percent of the vote in the rich globalist citadel of San Francisco and 87 percent of the vote in the equally affluent Manhattan.   Meanwhile, in the same election, Trump won 118 of 120 counties in Kentucky, which ranks 47th in the country in terms of median family income.  Indeed, in the Bluegrass State’s iconic Harlan County, scene of so much   tragedy and strife over the last     —  only now to find itself, along with the rest of coal country, in the crosshairs of the affluent global greens —  Trump won with almost 85 percent.   Moreover, if we drill down in another gritty state, Michigan, we can see even more evidence of how the political deck has been shuffled.  As we all know, Trump won the predominant   areas of the Wolverine State, thereby becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to win there since 1988. Notably, Trump won   Macomb County, just outside of Detroit, home to a population of more than 850, 000.  Macomb was long a stronghold of the United Auto Workers, and then, in the 1980s, it became notable as a new fortress of “Reagan Democrats. ”  Then many of those Reagan Democrats reverted back to Bill Clinton and his party in the 90s Macomb even went for Barack Obama in 2012, preferring him over     Mitt Romney.  And yet, in 2016, Trump carried the county by nearly a dozen points.   And this is, to put it mildly, an historic shift.  In recent decades, other Republican presidential candidates, such as Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, have carried Michigan, but their coattails were insufficient to win many House seats.  And yet today, in the 115th Congress, Republicans now control nine of the state’s 14 Congressional districts. So this is the new Republican Party.  As Trump said of the GOP in May, “Five, 10 years from now —  different party. You’re going to have a worker’s party. ”  In fact, we didn’t have to wait even that long, as the 2016 results show.  In the   words of Trump campaign adviser Steve Moore, “Just as Reagan converted the GOP into a conservative party, Trump has converted the GOP into a populist   party. ”  Thus we can now look at a    election map and see: There are rich blue dots (and also, poor blue dots) amidst a broad swathe of   red.  2. Goodbye Obamacare Hello, Trumpcare  Okay, so now to healthcare —  or, more precisely, health insurance.  As I have argued here recently, health itself is sometimes far different from health insurance.    Yet in the meantime, Trump campaigned on getting rid of Obamacare, as did Republicans in Congress.  So it’s a near certainty that the Affordable Care Act of 2010 will cease to exist.  And yet what will replace it?  Stipulating that the new plan is still unannounced, here’s an overall thesis statement for your consideration: In the long run, policy follows politics.  That is, people vote their policy interests, as they see them, and politicians had better be respectful of those interests.  And if they aren’t, then the voters will catch on quickly enough and throw them out of office.  And so it is, too, with healthcare.  So now we can add a further point: How you see healthcare depends in large part on where you stand economically.  This is not an argument about class this author is hardly a class warrior.  Instead, it’s a simple observation: People at different income levels have different experiences with the health system.  For the rich, health insurance is no problem they can afford all the healthcare they need or want, with or without health insurance.  And for the poor, health insurance is also not an issue they get it from the government, mostly through Medicaid, but also by simply coming into a hospital emergency room.  (Under a federal law in place since 1986, the ER has to take of anyone, regardless of ability to pay, or of citizenship status.)   Stuck in between, of course, is the middle class.  Especially these days, when companies are shedding their benefit packages, families have to scramble to buy adequate health insurance, dodging all the bureaucrats, both public and private.  In fact, just the other day here at Breitbart, Ann Coulter wrote about all the vexations she experienced in trying to buy private health insurance.  Moreover, not all healthcare is equal.  In fact, health and longevity vary strikingly by income.  Not surprisingly, those at the top do the best according to a 2015 report from the federal National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, a    man in the upper income quintile, or category, can expect to live another 38 years those in the   quintile can expect to live another 37 years.  Meanwhile, those in the exact middle can look forward to another 33 years.  Those in the   have another 28 years, while those at the bottom have another 26 years.  So we can see the wide disparity —  a   gap of longevity between the top and the middle, and a   gap between the top and the very bottom.  (Statistics for women show the same      although women typically live a couple of years longer than men.) So what’s causing this lifespan gap?  Yes, the rich can afford all the bells and whistles of “concierge medicine” and Number   hospitals, and yet as   Atul Gawande wrote recently, the biggest single variable in health outcomes is a regular visit to a general practitioner it’s the family doctor, knowing the patient, and his or her medical history, who can usually spot, for example, the difference between a heart attack and an allergic reaction.  As Gawande explains:  States with higher ratios of   physicians have lower rates of general mortality, infant mortality, and mortality from specific conditions such as heart disease and stroke.  Other studies found that people with a   physician as their usual source of care had lower subsequent   mortality rates than others, regardless of their initial health. All right, so how might all this be reflected in a   health plan?  We can start by recalling the Republican critique of Obamacare and, before that, of Clintoncare —  that being the failed effort by Hillary in the 1990s.  Republicans always said, “Don’t let a bureaucrat get between you and your doctor,” and they had a point —  a lifesaving point.  Such blunt wisdom is sure to inform the Trump administration’s health plan.   Indeed, the middle class can take comfort in the   background of many key Trump advisers.  The   origins of Stephen K. Bannon, son of a Richmond, VA, telephone lineman and splicer, are well known.   Yet less   is the life story of another top White House aide, Anthony Scaramucci he is the son of a Long Island construction worker who went on to earn a fortune as an investor.  Recently, Scaramucci recalled  what it was like to be on the campaign trail with Trump, mingling with the crowds of supporters:  Indeed, Trump is the only    to have been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame he has long been friends with the wrestling entrepreneurs Vince and Linda McMahon, and, in fact, has named Linda McMahon to head up the Small Business Administration.  So it’s no wonder that Trump used the old union word, “solidarity,” in his inaugural address —  a first for a president.  Continuing in that solidaristic theme, he added, referring to the American people:  And yet at the same time, most Americans do like the idea of helping young people get health insurance, and of preventing insurance companies from denying coverage to those with   conditions.  The polls show that ordinary people embrace those provisions by ratios of 2:1 or more.   Indeed, no less than Trump himself declared on January 15 that in his forthcoming plan, he wants to see  “insurance for everybody. ”  In that spirit, Sen. Lamar Alexander ( .) the chairman of the mighty Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, has been vocal on one salient point: The repeal of Obamacare must be accompanied by the replacement of Obamacare that is, by a better Trumpcare.  As Alexander said on January 18, while he and his panel heard the testimony of Tom Price, slated to be Trump’s new Secretary of Health and Human Services: Obamacare should be finally repealed only when there are concrete practical reforms in place to give Americans access to truly affordable health care.  Alexander added, “It’s not about developing a quick fix. ” That is, it’s about getting the new   policy right.  Repeal and replace.   And on January 26, Alexander reiterated his prudential approach, saying: Step by step, we will build better systems that give Americans access to truly affordable health care.  We will do this by moving health care decisions out of Washington, D. C. and back to states and patients. We can observe that Alexander is closely reflecting the views of the folks back home in Tennessee: Yes, they voted for Trump, and their elected officials almost unanimously opposed Obamacare.  And yet at the same time, Tennesseans, overall, are not rich —  they rank 45th in the nation, just two places above neighboring Kentucky.  Indeed, median income in the Volunteer State is more than 15 percent below the national median.   We can thus observe: People of modest means tend not to be libertarians they are usually willing to work hard, but life has taught them that they occasionally need protection to keep the wolf away from the door.   To put that point another way, they don’t wish to take a leap into the dark when it comes to their health and the health of loved ones.  Yes, the people of Tennessee like their freedom and independence, but they also know that their freedom, as well as health, can be jeopardized, too, by arrogant and unfeeling private health insurers.  The idea that careful provision needs to be made for all Americans is not a controversial position among leading Republicans.  Yes, sometimes there’s “noise” over precise   such as “access” vs. “coverage” —  and, of course, the Main Stream Media is always looking for ways to wedge Republicans apart —  but to the   the underlying unity of most GOPers is  .  For example, on January 18,     Mike Pence said on Fox News, “[Trump] has made it clear in the last few weeks that he wants to do ‘repeal and replace’ concurrently. ” On January 22, House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy ( ) echoed that point, saying, “We are going to repeal Obamacare and replace it”: We will assure everybody we are replacing it, just as we’ve always said and just like we’ve had the ideas out there that will allow people to actually have a better relationship with their doctor, not have “one size fits all,” bring more choice into the process  . . . and bring the premiums down . . .  People are going to like what they see. In addition, as the country waits to see what Trumpcare will look like, other  Republicans in the Senate have taken steps toward outlining alternatives to the existing program.  We might observe that they are doing so in a manner that’s in keeping with the GOP’s emphasis on federalism —  that is, pushing maximum   down from the federal level to the state level.   To that end, four Republicans —  Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, Bill Cassidy, Susan Collins, and Johnny Isakson —  have introduced the Patient Freedom Act of 2017, which would allow individual states to decide for themselves whether or not to keep, gulp, Obamacare.  Some might ask: Is the proposal of those four senators too much of a concession to the status quo for most Republicans to swallow?  Will some ideological activists accuse the senatorial quartet of being RINOs?  Perhaps they will.  And yet those four lawmakers were duly elected to represent their respective states we can further note that all of them —  Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, and West Virginia —  have incomes below the national median. That is, folks there may need help, even support, in navigating the   market —  and their elected officials know it. Indeed, another Republican senator, Steve Daines of Montana, has said that he wants to see Medicaid protected as well.  About 236, 000 people —  a quarter of the population —  in his state are on Medicaid.  And that figure, we might note, has increased about 60 percent in the last four years, mostly because of Obamacare.  And so if Obamacare were to be repealed and not replaced, it’s likely that most, if  not all, of those new enrollees would lose their benefits.  So we can ask: Would Daines, eyeing   be happy about that prospect?  Would he vote to cut so many of his own constituents?  Evidently, his answer is “no. ” Not everyone will be happy with Daines’ position, but that’s the hard reality of representative politics.   Perhaps the issue can be finessed somehow, as with   of Medicaid, but it will be a struggle —  one of many.   As they say, politics is that the slow boring of hard boards.  And yes, in case you’re wondering, Montana, too, is below the national median income.   On the other hand, if the reader is curious as to which states are above the median, here’s the full list —  most of them are represented by Democrats.  And so again we see the reality of the new partisan inversion.  In any case, since Republicans control the Senate by just a slim 52:48 margin, Trump and Senate Majority Leader McConnell (as we have seen, Kentucky is relatively poor as well) will have to use caution as they seek to shepherd the Trumpcare replacement model through Congress.  And when that legislation is shepherded, hopefully to a successful completion, here’s a prediction: It will be Trumpian.  That is, it will be cast in the new   model of Donald Trump.   Yes, if done right, Trumpcare will be the sort of legislation that   voters —  including the newest Republican voters —  will feel good about.  And hopefully, other Americans, too, will see its basic intelligence and decency, even if they might still choose to oppose it.   It’s with that inclusive spirit that the new Republican majority has been made, and it’s in that spirit that it will be maintained.",0
20133,20133,Spike Lee: Hillary Clinton Thought She Was ’Entitled’ to the Presidency,Jerome Hudson,"Filmmaker Spike Lee unleashed a flurry of personal insults at President Donald Trump and revealed why Hillary Clinton was wrong to think she was “entitled” to the presidency in an interview this week. [In a brief conversation with Hollywood Reporter at the Cannes Film Festival, the Do The Right Thing director didn’t mince words about the   : “He’s not my president. I call him Agent Orange. ”  “There was some clip I saw yesterday of him dancing with the Saudis that was just ludicrous,” Lee said about Trump recent foreign trip to Saudi Arabia. “Not only is he not a good president, he can’t dance either,” Lee said while laughing. “He could be impeached on his rhythm. He’s the clown with the nuclear codes. ” Lee endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for president in a radio ad last February and blasted the Democrat party’s “rigged” primary system. When asked if he ever came around to supporting Clinton, Lee unloaded on the former frontrunner. “Have you read the book Shattered? Great book,” Lee said of the new Clinton campaign   Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign, which offers a blistering    look at how Hillary Clinton lost the election.  “Hillary comes with entitlement. They thought they were entitled to this and despite what you might think, you gotta work,” Lee explained. “If you’re chilling at Martha’s Vineyard, and think ‘It’s a done deal.’ But it wasn’t. There’s one thing you can learn from sports. To quote Yogi Bear: “It ain’t over ’til it’s over. ” They thought it was theirs. Shit don’t work like that. ” The   director also said he wouldn’t support actor and former professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson as a presidential candidate without first knowing his politics. Johnson’s name has been floated as a possible Democratic contender to take on Trump in 2020. “No. Well, I’d need to know how he stood on issues. ” Lee said, adding that Johnson’s presidential ambitions, real or not, comes off as unauthentic, given Trump’s jump from reality TV host to 45th president. “The thing is, everyone thinks they can be president. Like, “Look, that guy did it. ” Lee is attending the Cannes Film Festival in France this week. The filmmaker moderated a QA with singer Elton John on Monday.

20134,20134,Trump Meets With Al Gore on Climate Change While House G.O.P. Rebuffs Tariff Plan - The New York Times,"John Schwartz, Jennifer Steinhauer, Eric Lipton and Ron Nixon","  Donald J. Trump and his daughter Ivanka met with former Vice President Al Gore on Monday to discuss   climate change. And a   believer finds the truth at a pizza parlor.  Al Gore thought he would be bending the ear of the adviser Mr. Trump trusts most, his daughter Ivanka. Instead, the man bearing “The Inconvenient Truth” went straight to the source: the   himself. “I had a lengthy and very productive session with the ” Mr. Gore, the former vice president, told reporters at Trump Tower. “It was a sincere search for areas of common ground. I had a meeting beforehand with Ivanka Trump. The bulk of the time was with the   Donald Trump. I found it an extremely interesting conversation, and to be continued. ” Hundreds of scientists are also telling Mr. Trump in a new letter that climate change is real and needs to be addressed: “We urge you to decide if you want your presidency to be defined by denial and disaster, or acceptance and action,” says the new letter, which will be sent on Tuesday and has already been signed by 700 scientists and academics from related disciplines. The letter lists six steps the   can take to help protect the nation’s “economy, national security, and public health and safety. ” Getting Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, to turn around on the issue might not be as unlikely as his public statements would make it seem. It may come down to who has his ear last. It must have felt familiar to Mr. Gore, confronting a   who had just lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College. In point of fact, Mr. Gore’s loss to George W. Bush pales in comparison with Hillary Clinton’s. If you’re still counting, Mrs. Clinton’s popular vote lead over Mr. Trump climbed to 2, 597, 156 over the weekend, five times Mr. Gore’s final lead over Mr. Bush. And at 2 percentage points, Mrs. Clinton’s lead has equaled Jimmy Carter’s victory spread over Gerald Ford in 1976. On Tuesday, House Democrats will convene a forum on the “Electoral College and the Future of American Democracy. ” No word on whether they will be picking up the tab to move Californians to Florida and Ohio. The electoral recriminations keep rolling in. A former Breitbart News reporter claimed last night on Facebook that he planted Clinton hecklers at her rallies, and has since deleted the post. The gunman who stormed a Washington pizzeria on Sunday confirmed that he was motivated by online articles that convinced him that the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, “was harboring sex slaves” and that he was “armed to help rescue them,” according to documents released at his arraignment. After the suspect, Edgar M. Welch, “found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant,” he surrendered peacefully, the documents said. The truth now known, perhaps Mr. Welch could tell the son of the  ’s pick for national security adviser, who said on Twitter: Also, if he had kept his assault rifle stashed, the gunman could have enjoyed a pizza and a beer, but we Washingtonians understand the wait for a   table can be pretty long. The House majority leader said a   Congress would not support the  ’s vow to hit companies that move overseas with a hefty tariff on goods sent back to the United States. And House Speaker Paul D. Ryan hinted strongly that he wouldn’t go along either. “I don’t want to get into some kind of trade war,” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, said in response to vehement threats by Mr. Trump over the weekend. Mr. Ryan echoed Mr. McCarthy’s view that an overhaul of the corporate tax code would better keep jobs in the United States than a punitive tariff on companies that send work abroad. “I think we can get at the goal here, which is keep American businesses American, build things in America and sell them overseas. That can be properly addressed in comprehensive tax reform,” the speaker told a Wisconsin reporter. In a storm of Twitter posts over the weekend, the   had been uncompromising on the proposal. An umbrella organization of Jewish groups is holding a Hanukkah party at the new Trump International Hotel in Washington, and one of its member groups is not too happy about it. “In the years to come, Jews in America are going to be regularly tested to make the right choices, and this is clearly not one of them,” wrote Peter Pepper and Ann Toback, the president and executive director of the Workmen’s Circle, in a letter to Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. In a telephone interview, Mr. Hoenlein said that the venue choice had been made by the partner for the party, the Azerbaijani Embassy, and that it was one of the few places that would hold a kosher reception on short notice. “There’s no other significance to it,” Mr. Hoenlein said, adding that Mr. Trump is not yet president, “so there’s no conflict. ” Of course, that partner, Azerbaijan, isn’t terribly popular either. Mr. Trump has a message to the news media: Cover him the way he wants or he’ll just have to keep tweeting  —   regardless of the consequences. The  ’s victory tour started with a bang in Cincinnati when he took a shot at Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and prompted the crowd into another round of “Lock her up” by saying how much he enjoyed beating up on Mrs. Clinton. The next dates are out: ■ Crown Coliseum in Fayetteville, N. C. at 7 p. m. Tuesday ■   Hall in Des Moines at 7 p. m. Central time Thursday. ■ DeltaPlex Arena in Grand Rapids, Mich. at 7 p. m. Friday Retired Marine Corps Gen. James N. Mattis may have led the 1st Marine Division during the invasion of Iraq and later oversaw the campaign for Falluja, but he now thinks the Iraq War was a mistake. “Ladies and gentlemen,” the  ’s choice to be secretary of defense told a conference in California, according to an audio tape obtained by The Intercept, “we will probably look back on the invasion of Iraq as a mistake  —   as a strategic mistake. ” Perhaps not coincidentally, Mr. Trump  —   his boss, should he be confirmed by the Senate  —   had a similar change of views on the war, though the   has famously insisted he always opposed the invasion. Several groups who favor limiting immigration are voicing their opposition to Representative Michael McCaul as a potential secretary of homeland security, saying the Texas Republican has been weak on border security. Mr. McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, has been a frequent critic of what he says is the Obama administration’s failure to adequately combat the Islamic State. But groups like the Center for Immigration Studies say Mr. McCaul’s efforts on border security and immigration have been weak and counterproductive. “He’s been the chairman of this critical committee and never tried to push through legislation that adequately addresses border security, immigration and homeland security,” said Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the center. The real aim may be less about opposing Mr. McCaul than opening a lane for the group’s homeland security chief of choice: Mr. Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state. The Federation for American Immigration Reform did not directly oppose Mr. McCaul but said the next secretary of the Department of Homeland Security needed to be someone who would implement real border and immigration security. “If Representative McCaul is chosen to head D. H. S. he will need to take a much more expansive view of border and immigration enforcement than he has in the past,” said Dan Stein, the president of the federation.",0
20135,20135,Processed red meat found to sort you out,nan,"Processed red meat found to sort you out 14-11-16 EATING large amounts of fried and processed red meat sorts you out, it has been confirmed. Researchers at the Institute for Studies found that sausages, bacon and even those microwave burgers can halt the ‘rough’ feeling that typically follows a drinking session but that you also sometimes get for no reason. Professor Henry Brubaker said: “We don’t know how processed red meat works to sort you out. It may be the high salt content, its greasiness or simply something to do with absorbing the life force of the animal. “It’s probably something like the animated map at the start of Dad’s Army , except the German army arrows are the feelings of roughness and the British arrows are sausages, bravely fending it off.” The discovery follows tests in which hungover ‘group A’ was given array of processed meat products including bacon and that pink oblong thing they sometimes sell at Lidl, while ‘group B’ had a grapefruit and some cereal which did not sort them out at all. Brubaker added: “It’s unclear if you can eat too much processed red meat, but probably not because your body can just store it as fat to be used when required.”

20136,20136,Iran and Boeing Sign $16.6 Billion Deal on Sale of 80 Aircraft - The New York Times,Thomas Erdbrink,"TEHRAN  —   Iran and Boeing signed a deal for the sale of 80 airplanes on Sunday, five weeks before the inauguration of   Donald J. Trump, whose Republican supporters in Congress have tried to block any aircraft sales to Iran. Iran’s national airline, Iran Air, said that it had signed an agreement with Boeing, an American manufacturer, to purchase the aircraft, at a total cost of $16. 6 billion. In September, the Treasury Department gave approval for Boeing and its European competitor, Airbus, to sell planes to Iran. Boeing confirmed the deal, saying that the contract was reached within the terms of the government license that the department had issued. The sale includes 50     737 planes and 30     777 aircraft. The first airplanes are scheduled for delivery in 2018, with the entire order being fulfilled over 10 years. In a statement, Boeing said the deal would support tens of thousands of American jobs directly associated with production and delivery of the airplanes, and nearly 100, 000 jobs in the broader aerospace industry in the United States. For nearly four decades, no American companies could engage in significant business with Iran, which officially considers the United States an archenemy. But with the deal, the country is not only buying aircraft from an American supplier it also means there will be   interaction between Boeing trainers and employees of Iran Air. The likelihood of the agreement being carried out, however, has decreased with the election of Mr. Trump. His Republican supporters in Congress introduced a bill that attempts to stop sales by Boeing to Iran, obliging the Treasury Department to refuse the licenses needed by American banks to finance such an agreement. The bill passed the House of Representatives in November, but President Obama has vowed to veto the legislation should it also gain Senate approval. Mr. Trump has had different stances on the sales of Boeing aircraft to Iran. In June, his campaign gave out a statement on the negotiations between Iran and Boeing, saying, “The world’s largest state sponsor of terror would not have been allowed to enter into these negotiations with Boeing without Clinton’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. ” But in January, he complained in a post on Twitter that after the nuclear agreement, which was enacted that month, the Iranians were going to spend their money in Europe rather than in the United States. “Iran is going to buy 116 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them   …     but they won’t buy from U. S. rather Airbus,” he wrote. With American banks possibly being blocked from financing and maybe even transferring money involved in the deal, it is unclear how Iran would pay for the aircraft. The Iranian state news agency, IRNA, in a report on the deal, made no mention who would finance the purchases. It did say that the agreement was not yet fully finalized. Abbas Akhoundi, Iran’s minister of roads and urban development, told state television that the contract was a clear message to the world. “In spite of all the warmongering,” he said, “businessmen and financiers gave a signal to the world that we are supporters of calmness, security and the development of relations. ”",0

20138,20138,PressTV-NATO pushes military buildup plans near Russia,nan,"NATO pushes military buildup plans near Russia Wed Oct 26, 2016 6:7AM EU NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg speaks during a news conference at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, October 25, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is pushing for its biggest military buildup near Russian borders, as the Western military alliance continues to harbor perceptions of a Russian “threat” since the days of the Cold War. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will discuss the plan for military deployments to the Baltic states and eastern Poland at a two-day meeting of NATO ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. 
The military alliance aims to send “battle groups” to the Baltic states and Poland early next year. The groups will consist of 40,000 forces. It will be the biggest military buildup near Russia since the Second World War. More forces would also be deployed if necessary. 
“This is credible deterrence. Not to provoke a conflict, but to prevent conflict,” Stoltenberg claimed contradictorily on Tuesday, referring to the planned deployments near Russia. “Concrete proof that NATO can and will deploy thousands of forces to support our allies. And a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.” 
The United States, Germany, Britain, and Canada have already agreed to contribute forces to the “battle groups,” which are to be deployed to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. Norwegian and Italian fighter jets patrol over the Baltics during a NATO air policing mission from an airbase in Lithuania, May 20, 2015. (Photo by Reuters) 
France, Denmark, Italy and other NATO members are expected to contribute forces of their own but have been reluctant so far. 
Anti-Russia by default 
Russia had previously warned that it would take unspecified measures to respond to the increased activities by the Western military bloc. 
It also moved nuclear-capable missiles to its westernmost region of Kaliningrad, near its border with the Baltic countries and NATO member states earlier this month. The Iskander-M cruise missiles are capable of hitting targets across Poland and the Baltics. 
NATO was formed during the Cold War as a means of countering the former Soviet Union. 
The military alliance suspended all ties with Moscow in April 2014, after the then-Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula voted in a referendum to join Russian territory. 
Shortly afterwards, an armed conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine, areas inhabited by an ethnically-Russian population. The Ukrainian government, which militarized the originally peaceful unrest in the regions — known as the Donbass — has ever since been accusing Russia of having a hand in the conflict there. Moscow denies the claim. 
The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 9,200 people and left over 21,000 others injured. Loading ... ",1
20139,20139,"Inspired by the U.S., West Africans Wield Smartphones to Fight Police Abuse - The New York Times",Dionne Searcey and Jaime Yaya Barry,"DAKAR, Senegal  —   The YouTube video shows a grim scene from Ivory Coast: An unarmed man lies on a street with his arms up. A police officer fires a shot that appears to strike him. The man, a theft suspect, squirms on the road as the officer kicks and hovers over him, firing his weapon several times near his head, bullets hitting the ground just inches away. The officer then aims directly at the man’s forehead and pulls the trigger, killing him. The video, recorded by an onlooker using a cellphone camera, spread widely across social media this summer, attracting comments like “What is this horror. ” “Isn’t this what’s happening in the USA right now?” writes one viewer. “We’re killing innocent people. ” Inspired by the videos that have captured police killings and defined the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, West Africans are increasingly deploying social media in nations where corruption and abuse by security forces sometimes occur with few repercussions. In America, videos of white police officers shooting unarmed black men have caused a social uprising, exposing what many people see as a deadly national bias in law enforcement. Here in West Africa, where cellphone and internet use has exploded in recent years and social media websites are hugely popular, race is rarely a factor in the videos being shared online. But wealth and power are. So, just as in the United States and other places where social media has enabled protest, citizens who feel marginalized are using the videos to seek justice when law enforcement officers abuse their authority. “There is a general sense that law officials can do pretty much whatever they want,” said Vincent Foucher, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, who has worked extensively in West Africa. “Images are a very powerful way to bring up these issues. ” In Nigeria, capturing law enforcement abuse is so popular that people send in videos and photos taken from scenes of military brutality, bribery by public officials and other misconduct to one of the nation’s biggest television stations, which shows them in a segment called “Eye Reports” during its main news program. “They are now part of the reporting of the good, the bad and the ugly of the country’s social life,” says Lanre Arogundade, the coordinator of the International Press Center in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. Human rights workers say that the practice of sharing videos in West Africa is a natural extension of longstanding frustrations with abuse of power in the region. But even with today’s ability to capture and broadcast evidence immediately, the videos have not always produced tangible results. Often the clips are hard to verify, and few prosecutions have followed, experts say. Scenes of police officers seeking checkpoint bribes or beating civilians sometimes amount to no more than a handful of Facebook comments expressing indignation. But little by little, many of the videos shared on social media are chipping away at impunity and in some cases drawing widespread attention to problems that the authorities are finding hard to ignore. “These have led to, if not prosecutions, at least more awareness and discussion of violations, and that is really important,” said Sabrina Mahtani, West Africa researcher for Amnesty International. In areas where law and order is scant, videos are sometimes shared online by supporters of the police  —   as a cautionary tale of what happens to wrongdoers who are rightly, if violently, punished for doing bad things. But once they make their way across social media, they are sometimes cited as evidence of abuse by security forces, evoking outrage and injustice. In the video of the officer shooting the man in Ivory Coast, for instance, one onlooker can be heard saying, “Again, do it again!” after the officer shoots the man the first time. Others in the crowd appear to egg on the officer, and at the end of the clip, another person off camera can be heard saying, “Don’t film him, don’t film him,” adding, “You are going to get that police officer in trouble. ” But as the video made its way across the internet, it prompted an uproar in Abidjan, the nation’s economic capital, where the officer was arrested and an official investigation was opened. In a statement widely reported by the local news media, the chief of the Ivorian national police force said it “will not tolerate behavior from its officers that is contrary to the ethics of human rights. ” In July, Sheriff Shittu, who is not a law enforcement officer, was stuck on a highway in Lagos watching a scene he felt deserved the collective outrage of the internet. A soldier was beating a bus conductor, waving a gun and threatening to shoot the man. Other soldiers joined in, shouting, “We’re going to kill him. ” “That was when I took out my phone and started recording,” said Mr. Shittu, who posted the video on YouTube. “It’s a deterrent to abuse and power. This guy didn’t do anything wrong. ” Mr. Shittu said he was inspired by the success of American videos in drawing attention to violence by law enforcement officers and had seen videos of similar episodes shared online that resulted in soldiers being disciplined in Nigeria. “In the past nothing would happen,” he said. “That’s changing now. ” In Conakry, Guinea, a video that was circulated on the internet several months ago showed an armed robbery suspect with his hands and feet tied to an iron bar. Uniformed national police officers paraded him around, suspending him from the bar like an animal carcass, in an attempt to get a confession. “You’re breaking my hands!” the suspect shouts. One of the officers at the scene that day posted the video on his Facebook page, apparently for bragging rights. But it was shared across social media, prompting denunciations from Guinean human rights organizations. The Guinean government, which passed measures in 2011 aimed at cracking down on forced confessions, suspended 13 officers over the episode and opened an investigation into using torture to extract confessions.   citizens certainly have not put a halt to abuses of authority. In Nigeria, the military has been accused of killing countless civilians in recent years. And in some nations, government opposition forces and protesters have been threatened, beaten, jailed or sometimes killed without consequence, even when the abuse was captured on video. But police abuse is not the only issue the videos help address. This spring in Cameroon, onlookers captured a horrific scene   outside a hospital, leading to a national outcry about the state of the health care system. Monique Koumate, who was pregnant with twins, arrived at a hospital in distress and died before she entered. En route to the morgue, her relatives noticed that the fetuses, apparently still alive, were moving inside Ms. Koumate’s body. They rushed back to the hospital but were unable to summon help. Desperate to save the babies, one relative placed Ms. Koumate’s corpse on the sidewalk and sliced open her stomach, pulling out the babies and resting them on her stomach. It was too late. They were dead. The gruesome scene went viral online. A Twitter hashtag #MoniqueKoumate was created, and accusations were aired that the hospital had turned away Ms. Koumate because she could not pay for care. The public outrage prompted the hospital to investigate and led to a report by the National Order of Doctors of Cameroon citing deficiencies and calling for better maternal health care. But police abuse is still the focus of many people, with numerous Facebook and WhatsApp groups in the region dedicated to sharing videos on the topic. In Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone,   were already recording when Yasmine Bilkis Ibrahim pulled out her phone to film an officer screaming and waving his gun at a terrified unarmed man after an apparent traffic altercation. “I will kill you,” the officer yelled at the man. “And nothing will come of it. ” Ms. Ibrahim, 24, made an immediate link to what is happening in the United States. “If people can use such videos in America to demand justice, I believe we can also demand justice using the same method,” she said. Brima Kamara, a spokesman for the Sierra Leone police, said he belongs to a WhatsApp group, called “Talk With the Police,” made up of police officers, politicians and regular citizens. People often submit video clips to the group, alleging police misbehavior. One recent submission showed two officers fighting. The men were suspended and sent back to the police academy for more training, Mr. Kamara said. He said the videos help improve the police force in a nation still recovering from a brutal civil war that ended 14 years ago. “We often advise officers to be careful of their actions in public because at this age they can’t get away with crimes or actions,” Mr. Kamara said. “Now with the involvement of social media and the smartphones, everything goes public in just a minute. ”",0
20140,20140,Mary Jo White to Step Down as S.E.C. Chief - The New York Times,Ben Protess and Alexandra Stevenson,"Wall Street regulators began an exodus from Washington on Monday as Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced plans to leave the agency. The decision makes Ms. White, a former federal prosecutor who has served more than two decades in the federal government, the first major Obama administration appointee to step down after Donald J. Trump’s upset victory last week. Other financial regulators are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks. The election of Mr. Trump is a   for the S. E. C.  —   and for that matter, all financial agencies. Ms. White was expected to leave no matter the outcome of the election. But many Democrats had hoped that if Hillary Clinton won, she would choose a strong proponent of regulation to succeed Ms. White, whose policies often reflected a political middle ground. Now, the agency is almost certain to be pushed to the right. Mr. Trump has vowed to dismantle   the financial regulatory overhaul Congress passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. And although   will more likely be watered down than repealed, his appointments will no doubt shift the tone and priorities across financial regulatory agencies. The  ’s biggest move on Wall Street could be his choice for Treasury secretary. Mr. Trump’s short list is said to include Steven Mnuchin, an investment manager and former Goldman Sachs partner who was Mr. Trump’s campaign finance chairman, and Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. Hensarling is still being considered, in part because of pressure from Congress, but Mr. Mnuchin is the favorite of Mr. Trump’s Wall Street backers, according to someone with direct knowledge but who was not authorized to speak publicly. A decision is expected within 10 days. Either way, the Trump Treasury Department might rein in the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a collection of regulators who examine financial risks and designate companies as systemically important. The Treasury secretary is chairman of the council and could effectively defang it, according to Ian Katz, a policy analyst at Capital Alpha who predicted that the council might essentially become “a quarterly kaffeeklatsch. ” Mr. Trump was elected at a pivotal time for the S. E. C. an agency that had already turned a corner under Ms. White. Unlike Mary L. Schapiro, who inherited a   S. E. C. after the financial crisis, Ms. White needed not to save the agency, but to modernize it, a task that the next administration also will face. Ms. White’s departure, which will take effect at the end of the Obama administration in January, will set off speculation about whom Mr. Trump will select to succeed her. Though such talks have barely begun, the field of potential contenders could include Michael S. Piwowar, a Republican commissioner at the agency. Paul S. Atkins, a former S. E. C. Republican commissioner who has advocated deregulatory policies, is leading Mr. Trump’s effort to select a new chair for the agency and could be a candidate. Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund manager who supported Mr. Trump’s candidacy, is also advising the transition team. “As the head of the S. E. C. you’ve got to get back into reffing the game properly and end the demonization of Wall Street,” Mr. Scaramucci said in an interview last week before his appointment to Mr. Trump’s transition team. As other of President Obama’s financial regulators step down, the firewall around his Wall Street legacy will start to crumble. Timothy Massad, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is expected to leave by early 2017, though he could briefly stay at the agency as a Democratic commissioner. An even bigger change could occur at the banking regulators  —   the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  —   which became a thorn in the side of Wall Street under President Obama. Martin J. Gruenberg and Thomas Curry, the leaders of the F. D. I. C. and O. C. C. will probably leave office next year when their terms expire, or possibly even sooner. Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor who oversees many of the central bank’s regulatory efforts, is not expected to serve out his term through early 2022. He could leave early next year, which would deliver a blow to proponents of Wall Street regulation. With turnover at the S. E. C. Ms. White’s legacy could be in jeopardy as well. She oversaw a record number of enforcement actions and directed a rapid pace of   based not only on   but on regulations of her own making. Those initiatives were aimed at improving money market fund regulation and the broader asset management industry. “I think what we’ve done so far has been quite transformative and really modernized that core responsibility,” Ms. White said in a recent interview. Yet Ms. White has not completed more than a dozen rules, nor has she formalized a plan to require that financial advisers act in their clients’ best interests. Now that these initiatives will fall into the hands of a Republican chairman, they may come off the agenda. As it was, Ms. White, a political independent, drew criticism from liberal lawmakers who view her as the quintessential moderate. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who channels the populist outrage over Wall Street excess, even called on President Obama to designate a new S. E. C. leader because the agency had not required companies to disclose political contributions. In her first public remarks on the subject, Ms. White said in an interview that the criticism “really does come with the territory. ” “I think I’m a very constructive recipient of constructive criticism,” she said, adding: “It’s not like you like people to beat on your head, whoever they are, however baseless it is. ” Before the S. E. C. Ms. White was the first woman to become United States attorney in Manhattan, one of the most apolitical jobs in government. Earning a reputation as a tenacious prosecutor with an independent streak, Ms. White embraced the joke that her office was the United States attorney for the “sovereign,” rather than Southern, district of New York. “She’s not motivated by any special interest,” said Preet Bharara, a prosecutor under Ms. White who is now the United States attorney in Manhattan. “People may disagree from time to time, and, in fact, in any   environment, it would be unnatural if there weren’t disagreement from special interests and adversaries. But she’s hyper smart and makes a decision immune from any political wind or political criticism, and I think that’s a good way to be. ” Ms. White’s prosecutorial experience  —   she supervised the original investigation into Osama bin Laden  —   raised expectations for her enforcement agenda at the S. E. C. And in its last fiscal year, the agency brought a record 548   enforcement actions. In conjunction with Andrew J. Ceresney, the agency’s enforcement director, Ms. White reversed the S. E. C. ’s longstanding yet unofficial policy of allowing companies to neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.   such admissions have been made since. Other “firsts” occurred under Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney: the first action against a major ratings firm, Standard  Poor’s, and the first action against a company, KBR Inc. for inserting overly restrictive confidentiality agreements that could stifle  . Some of the agency’s most novel cases came against private equity firms that failed to disclose fees and conflicts of interest. Ms. White is known for keeping a workaholic’s schedule. Colleagues said it was common for her to hold a 9 p. m. Sunday conference call, before dispatching    night emails and placing a 5:30 a. m. call to senior staff. But she also promoted staff morale by holding coffee and doughnut sessions. Every holiday season, she would give a party for her staff at Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where she would hand out gifts to each of her aide’s children. Ms. White, a partial Yankees season ticket holder whose favorite moment as S. E. C. chairwoman came when throwing out the first pitch at a Washington Nationals game, said her dream job would be the first female baseball commissioner. “I really don’t think about what I’m doing next until I’m done,” she said, except, “If you have baseball commissioner to offer me, then I can tell you what my plans are. ”",0

20142,20142,The Deteriorating Situation in Ethiopia,Anonymous,"Tweet Widget by Yohannes Woldemariam 
The minority ethnic regime in Ethiopia now faces multiple rebellions. The regime’s foreign friends are part of the problem. “Faced with increased intrusion into their lands by so-called international investors, by displacement and by the breakdown of their social fabric, Ethiopians are mobilizing to resist.” The once formidable government coalition “is beginning to unravel.” The Deteriorating Situation in Ethiopia by Yohannes Woldemariam 
This article previously appeared in Pambazuka News . 
“ The revolts are widespread and they appear beyond the power of the state to control and put down.” 
The revolts in Ethiopia have the potential for creating radical, beneficial changes in the political order or instigating complete chaos that crosses its borders and destabilizes the entire fragile Horn of Africa region, for the outcomes of such uprisings have varied considerably from country to country. These protests can be the catalyst for building a new and democratic Ethiopia or end up in tears and disillusionment, as in Libya, South Sudan and many other places in the world. Countries emerging from dictatorships are particularly vulnerable and Ethiopia is certainly under a vicious dictatorship. 
The events in Ethiopia are being described as “Intifada,” “Ethiopian Spring” or as something akin to the Color Revolutions in the Ukraine and Georgia and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China. During the uprising in 2005 protesting the rigged election, the late chief of the Tigrean Peoples’ Liberation Front (TPLF) and Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, did say that there would not be any more Color Revolutions in Ethiopia. That uprising was put down with hundreds dead and thousands in concentration camps. 
This time, however, the revolts are widespread and they appear beyond the power of the state to control and put down. Apparently, Mr. Zenawi spoke prematurely. Technological innovation is a very important part of this current political mass mobilization, which is why the government has moved with cutting Ethiopia off from the internet and dismantling satellite dishes from the homes of ordinary citizens. Drawing on satellite television, mobile phones and the Internet, the revolts are spreading. Within seconds, activists send their messages against the tyranny. Unsurprisingly, the TPLF oligarchy is extremely fearful of social media websites like Facebook, Twitter and the diaspora media. 
In this piece, I want to reflect on three points: 
1. The celebrity factor: Feyisa Lilesa versus Prime Minister Halemariam Desalegn 
2. Mr. Abay Tsehaye’s reference to Rwanda 
3. The newly declared State of Emergency 
The celebrity factor: Feyisa Lilesa versus Prime Minister Halemariam Desalegn 
In the wake of the Rio Olympics, the profile of the Ethiopian uprising got a boost from Feyisa Lilesa , with his heroic act of crossing his arms on winning the silver medal for marathon, a signature symbol of solidarity of the oppressed Oromo nation to which Feyisa belongs. The influence of the celebrity athlete for social change is formidable, and Feyisa has emerged as a powerful voice for the struggle of his Oromo people, causing nervous shivers in the beleaguered regime. What the death and imprisonment of thousands of Oromos couldn’t accomplish in Ethiopia was achieved by his symbolic act at the finish line. Now the whole world is clued into the terrible conditions in Ethiopia and beginning to learn about the plight of the Oromo people. 
Other Ethiopian athletes have since used their successes to follow suit. Ebsa Ejigu, Tamiru Demissie and Hirut Guangul have used their international successes to publicize the plight of their country’s men and women to an international audience. This trend is likely to continue now as other athletes and celebrities are losing their fear of retaliation and becoming more and more willing to participate in what has become a growing national movement. Yes, these athletes will pay a price. Lilesa is now separated from his wife and children and beckoning an unknown fate. Life in exile will not be easy even for famous athletes. But compared to those losing lives and limbs to bullets in Ethiopia, it is a small price to pay. They are heroes, and their names are already inscribed in history books. 
“These athletes will pay a price.” 
The TPLF reaction to Lilesa’s heroic act can be gleaned from statements given by PM Hailemariam Desalegn. Although the PM is from the Wolayta ethnic group, which was traditionally relegated to the periphery of the Ethiopian mainstream, he has become a willing accomplice and spokesman for the TPLF. Most people regard him as an accidental PM who happened to be in the right place and at the right time when his powerful boss, PM Meles Zenawi, passed away in the summer of 2012. He was handpicked as Zenawi’s deputy because he wasn’t a threat and, as a non-Tigrean, served as a convenient cover and a token representing “diversity” for the TPLF. He is so loyal to the late PM, he still refers to the Meles “vision” in his public pronouncements. Most Ethiopians know that he is just a figurehead with no real power. Yet, in an interview conducted with the online Foreign Policy.com, he is quoted as saying: 
“It’s me who sent [Lilesa] to Rio for the Olympics, and we expected him to come back after winning the medal. . . . [T]his is not the capacity of the man himself. It’s something which has been orchestrated by someone else from outside.” 
It is remarkable that the PM has the audacity to say he sent Feyisa Lilesa to the Olympics, as if Feyisa needed his charitable permission. It is crystal clear that Feyisa earned his place in the Olympics. 
One can readily concede that he may have acquiesced to nepotism by sending to the Olympics the unqualified son of the head of the sports federation, Robel Kiros Habte , who made Ethiopia a laughing stock with his hopeless performance in a swimming race. But no one can doubt that Feyisa went to the Olympics because he was Ethiopia’s best hope for the marathon. And he delivered in no unmistakable terms by winning a silver medal competing with the best and the elites in the world. It is hard to believe that Desalegn referring to Feyisa actually said: “This is not the capacity of the man himself” – thus exposing his own pomposity, shallowness and contempt for the Oromo hero. Clearly, Desalegn has sold his soul to the TPLF devil. To suggest that Feyisa cannot think for himself and act on his own is inexcusably ignorant and arrogant and unbecoming of a prime minster. 
“Desalegn is a sellout with little dignity, reading and parroting whatever script is given to him by the TPLF.” 
Feyisa is not only a fine athlete; he is also a dignified, proud, principled and articulate Oromo and Ethiopian, as he amply demonstrated during the press conference in the Washington D.C. rally where Congressman Chris Smith also spoke. Also, in a direct reply to the PM’s insult, Feyisa quipped: 
“I was not surprised by his comments because individuals who are always controlled by others tend to assume everyone is that way as well. . . . Unlike the prime minister, I make my own decisions and speak for myself.” 
Indeed, Desalegn is a sellout with little dignity, reading and parroting whatever script is given to him by the TPLF. The pretentious PM has replaced the real world with a make-believe virtual world. It is for this reason that he is unable to see realities on the ground; he is temporarily sheltered behind a wall whose mortar is sychophantic servitude and a wicked willingness to say and do anything to appease his TPLF benefactors. 
It is beyond regrettable that Desalegn is unable to see the rapid downside toward further chaos and civil war in Ethiopia that is due to the abject misery and oppression suffered by the people who are subjected to the policies of those he is serving and to whom he has sold his soul. He calls himself a born-again Christian with a straight face. How would Jesus himself, who stood up to the hypocritical Pharisees and threw the money-changers out of the temple in Jerusalem, have regarded a man like Desalegn, who is in bed with the TPLF elites who are the modern day equivalent of the Pharisees in Ethiopia and whose words and actions rarely match? The human suffering that is the result of the violent and continuous repression cannot be seen from inside their ideological castles resting on the thin air of empty rhetoric and shameless self-promotion. 
Desalegn would be well advised to keep his mouth closed to spare himself more disgrace. He has already sunk into the deep end of an abyss. It is depressing to see a human being selling out his people and becoming a slave of oppressors. 
Invoking the specter of Rwanda 
The TPLF ideologue and one of the real powers behind the throne, Mr. Abay Tsehaye, in an interview with the pro-government Radio Fana, compared the situation of Rwanda in the early 90s to the current situation in Ethiopia. He correctly stated that Rwanda was comprised of only two ethnic groups (the Hutu and the Tutsi), really not much of a country, and was on the verge of disintegration. He went on to say that reconciliation occurred and the country recovered. In Ethiopia with over eighty ethnic groups, if the situation goes “out of control,” he concluded, Ethiopia will cease to exist as a country. Every thoughtful person worries about this. However, one can reasonably surmise from his analysis that Ethiopia under the control of his Tigray-dominated government, who make up only six percent of the Ethiopian population, is his guarantee for holding the country together. Mr. Tsehaye fails to recognize the draconian hegemonic policies of his regime as the very reasons for the grim state of affairs in the country. As the Ethiopian uprising makes clear, the various ethnicities are no longer buying TPLF shenanigans and see the TPLF itself as the main cause of Ethiopia’s predicament, as the country descends into possible civil war. 
For anyone willing to see the truth, Ethiopia is in a state of turmoil due to the exploitation of the long-suffering people of Oromia, Ogaden, Gambella and other ethnic groups by the TPLF elite in partnership with international enablers such as China and the United States, the principal rivals in Africa and the Horn region. The TPLF exploitation, in which valuable resources and political roles are dominated by a minority elite that has transformed itself into an oligarchy, has created highly rebellious resentment by the victims while reinforcing a sense of ethnic identity and consciousness. Faced with increased intrusion into their lands by so-called international investors, by the displacement and stunted developments they experience and by the breakdown of their social fabric, Ethiopians are mobilizing to resist. 
“The various see the TPLF itself as the main cause of Ethiopia’s predicament, as the country descends into possible civil war.” 
The government’s state-driven development projects financed by international investors and partners bypass the rural peasants and pastoralists, alienating the people and reinforcing the politics of deep ethnic hierarchy. Recent events have made it clear that TPLF’s “constitutional federalism” has more to do with its divide-and-rule strategy and its elitist allocation of national resources, comparable to actions of the former Soviet Communist Party, which retained tight control over its regions through local parties. The TPLF set up People’s Democratic Organizations, local versions of the ruling party, which squeezed out traditional authority. 
The co-opted ethnic leaders from these regions have either completely lost credibility, are sitting on the fence, or are jumping ship to support the resistance. Key former government figures like Junedin Sado are breaking their silence and speaking out with scathing attacks on the regime. He has apologized to the Ethiopian people for the time that he served under the regime. The so- called coalition that the TPLF built is beginning to unravel. Some Amhara and some Oromo are coming together against the TPLF, overcoming but not necessarily forgetting, the legacy of the historic oppression by Amhara elites which began with Menelik II. 
Abay Tsehaye and TPLF leaders will need to face reality — if they have it in them to be truly concerned about Ethiopian unity. Oromo historical grievances are not myths, as some revisionist history asserts. Oromo land is the most fertile and lush in Ethiopia, in contrast to the northern Ethiopian highlands with its rugged mountains and thin soils contributing relatively little to national economic production, but the Oromo have been alienated from control over their land throughout the 20th century first by the Amhara and now by the new TPLF overlords. 
Acutely divided societies in which no single faction can impose its view might find an ability to arrive at political compromises in a constitutional form. But in Ethiopia, the hegemonic Amhara and now the Tigreans have excluded others from real power-sharing making true constitutionalism elusive. The leaders see the state as a prize to be won, a basis for private accumulation and patronage. But there is not enough patronage to go around, and those excluded from it mobilize their co-religionists and ethnic groups in an increasingly unmanageable opposition. 
The State of Emergency 
In response, the TPLF is relying on intensified repression by security forces, ethnic loyalists and the army. And for the first time in twenty-five years, the regime has declared a State of Emergency , clearly showing how rattled it is by the rebellion in the country. The Prime Minster announced : 
“The cause of this (state of emergency) is that anti-peace forces in collaboration with foreign enemies of the country are making organized attempts to destabilize our country, to disrupt its peace and also to undermine the existence and security of its peoples.” 
This response undoubtedly means more sticks and further erosion of civil liberties in the country but is unlikely to quell the unrest. One of the targets of the State of Emergency is the Internet and Social Media. PM Desalegn did make it a point to rant against diaspora media and the Internet during his appearance in September at the United Nations General Assembly: 
“In fact, we are seeing how misinformation could easily go viral via social media and mislead many people, especially the youth…Social media has certainly empowered populists and other extremists to exploit people’s genuine concerns and spread their message of hate and bigotry without any inhibition...it is critical to underline one matter which is usually given short shrift, both by the media and others. It is simply hypocritical to deny that some of our countries have been targets for destabilization activities carried out with no accountability by people and groups who have been given shelters by States with whom we have absolutely no problems.” 
The regime that Desalegn serves is responsible for suffocating the Ethiopian people by denying them any alternative media. The Ethiopian government is one of the top jailers and harassers of anyone daring to publish or practice independent journalism within the country. Now, Desalegn is shedding his crocodile tears about his inability to control and suppress social media and broadcasting emanating from the diaspora. While he has a point about the inherent potential for the abuse of social media, the regime is responsible for bringing criticisms on itself. In the absence of media freedom in the country, social media and broadcasting from the diaspora acquired enormous significance for Ethiopians hungry for information. It is clear that Ethiopians no longer trust the regime and have little confidence in official government news, which in reality is mostly propaganda. 
“The Ethiopian government is one of the top jailers and harassers of anyone daring to publish or practice independent journalism.” 
Authoritarian regimes adopt various forms of censorship to depoliticize the population and prevent the questioning of their legitimacy. By definition, authoritarian regimes demand strict submission by the media to their political authority. They do so by publishing or broadcasting deceptions in order to maintain their power structures. For example, the regime’s media censored Feyisa’s symbolic gesture in Rio while proclaiming that Feyisa is a national hero and welcome to return home, without any consequences. 
The advent of the Internet has somewhat leveled the playing field by empowering regular Internet users to become content producers by utilizing decentralized and distributed networks such as social media. These uses of media pose a great danger to dictatorial regimes, which are moving to subvert, block social media and limit internet use, as in Ethiopia today. 
China is the leading culprit in creating the technology to enable censorship, which it is sharing with the Ethiopian government. This suppression of the media will not succeed. Freedom-loving people find ways to circumvent these barriers and make determined efforts to stay informed – and, in turn, to inform the whole world. Yohannes Woldemariam is an educator and author.

20143,20143,She Drank a Gallon of Water/Day for a Month and Now She Looks 10 Years Younger,noreply@blogger.com (Alexander Light),". She Drank a Gallon of Water/Day for a Month and Now She Looks 10 Years Younger Sufficient daily water intake is vital for virtually every function within our bodies yet fewer than... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/she-drank-gallon-of-waterday-for-month.html Sufficient daily water intake is vital for virtually every function within our bodies yet fewer than one in five of us drinks enough. Read on to see the results of this experiment. Sarah Smith is a 42 year old mother of two young kids in the UK. She, like many others, openly admitted to not drinking the recommended 2 to 3 liters of water daily. She suffered from poor and sluggish indigestion and regular headaches. Following consultations with medical professionals for both issues she decided to take heed of the advice given – in both cases she had been told that she needed to up her intake of water . She decided to document and photograph what happened in a self imposed experiment whereby she would drink 3 liters, just over 5 pints, of water per day, every day for an entire month and see if she could feel any benefits.At the outset Sarah took a long hard look at her face noting that: “I am 42, but have to admit I look more like 52 in this picture, which is shocking. There are dark shadows under and around my eyes, which make me look exhausted, a profusion of wrinkles and strange reddish blotches, and my skin lacks any lustre. It looks dead… even my lips look shrivelled.” She spread the water out during the day aiming to drink a big jug of water in the morning, another in the afternoon with a third in the evening.At the end of the FIRST WEEK she had already noticed that her bowel function was improved and her urine was virtually clear as the water was flushing out her previously dehydrated poorly functioning kidneys. She noticed sudden skin breakouts, which were a result of the toxins being eliminated from throughout her body. However, her headaches were already gone and her previous joint stiffness first thing in the morning was vastly improved. Water is vital for lubricating the joints. WEEK TWO saw an improvement in her skin tone and general complexion although she noted that her eyes were still wrinkled but said “they look less crepey and shadowy than before”. She also had a visibly flatter stomach and her smart husband paid her the ultimate compliment by noting that her cellulite had vanished! Significantly she had another week headache free.On to WEEK THREE when Sarah was happy to find that her eye wrinkles and dark circles had all but disappeared and her skin was plumper and healthier looking.She noted that she was actually eating less by this stage as she had fallen into the common trap of reading signals from her stomach as being hunger pangs whereas they were actually thirst pangs. Research has shown that 37 per cent of people actually mistake thirst signals for hunger signals. The plentiful water had now stopped her from continually falling into that unhealthy trap.So what about the end of WEEK FOUR ? Sarah said: “I genuinely can’t believe the difference in my face. I look like a different woman. The dark shadows around my eyes have all but disappeared and the blotches have gone. My skin is almost as dewy as it was when I was a child. The transformation is nothing short of remarkable.” She was leaner, fitter and nobody can deny the astonishing change to her appearance. She changed nothing else in her daily routine apart from the water intake. To those already of you already converted to drinking enough water these results will merely confirm what you already know, but to anyone who is guilty of not doing so, will this persuade you to try this for yourself? Alexander : Since we have addressed the miraculous rejuvenating power of water, here is one more mind-blowing fact. According to Gregg Prescott of In5D.com , he was able to restore his hair's original color after only six months of drinking distilled water . In his own words: ""In August of 2010, I was 2 months away from turning 50 and my hair was predominantly gray, with pronounced lines around my eyes. This is when I began to be conscientious about my eating habits and started eating more organic food, although I was still eating processed food as well. I began drinking distilled water in February 2012. By August of 2012, my hair had turned from gray back to its original color and the facial lines were not as pronounced."" And the results are fantastic! Here's a before and after comparison: You can buy a good quality water distiller from Amazon for about $200, which is not that much considering the benefits.

20144,20144,Feminist Camille Paglia Slams Clinton,Michael Ware,"Email 
There is very little truth in politics today. We all, for different reasons, pull for a letter or party rather than for character and ability. We will spin for our candidate because of the party we root for so that others will blindly follow the party line. 
If my guys are running the country, we think, then things will be better. Even though these guys support and do things that are contrary to our definition of ""better."" So, when a person comes out and speaks truth about “their” candidate, it can be refreshing. 
This is why I am so excited by what I read recently 
The Washington Times reports : 
Lesbian feminist author and professor Camille Paglia has delivered a scathing rebuke of Hillary Clinton , saying the sole reason for the Democratic presidential nominee’s success is because she is a woman. 
“It’s an outrage how she’s played the gender card,” Ms. Paglia told The Spectator magazine in an interview published Friday. “She is a woman without accomplishment. ‘I sponsored or co-sponsored 400 bills.’ Oh really? These were bills to rename bridges and so forth. And the things she has accomplished have been like the destabilization of North Africa, causing refugees to flood into Italy … The woman is a disaster!” 
Paglia is well-known for her attacks on modern feminism. And she has boldly stated the truth about this anti-feminist woman, Hillary Clinton . Hillary is a woman who is only well-known because of her womanizing sex-offending husband. 
As I have shown before, there actually may be a shift in power, as those the Democrats have used to gain said power are finally noticing that they are receiving almost nothing in return for their vote. 
Paglia says as much. 
The Times continue: 
“If Hillary wins, nothing will change,” she continued. “She knows the bureaucracy, all the offices of government and that’s what she likes to do, sit behind the scenes and manipulate the levers of power. But people want change and they’re sick of the establishment.” 
She even went as far as giving a point to Trump: 
Ms. Paglia said it’s very unlikely that a Donald Trump presidency would threaten Western civilization, as so many pundits and politicians have predicted. 
Things they are changing.

20145,20145,"Lula and Simba, Last Surviving Animals at Mosul Zoo, Have Been Rescued - The New York Times",Rana F. Sweis,"AMMAN, Jordan  —   The last surviving animals in the Montazah   Zoo in the   Iraqi city of Mosul  —   Lula, a bear, and Simba, a lion  —   reached safety at a wildlife shelter in Amman, the Jordanian capital, on Monday night. Their home at the zoo was severely damaged as battles for control of the city, Iraq’s second largest, have raged for months between Iraqi forces and Islamic State militants. A   people are thought to be unable to escape the city. The Islamic State has used civilians as human shields, and American airstrikes, supporting Iraqi counterterrorism forces, have leveled parts of Mosul. A strike in one neighborhood last month was thought to have killed as many as 200 civilians. About 40 animals had died at the zoo in recent months. Some starved and some were killed by bombs, according to Four Paws International, an animal welfare organization based in Vienna that carried out the rescue. Workers said that the animals’ cages were filthy and that Simba and Lula urgently needed veterinary care. Amir Khalil, a veterinarian with Four Paws who led the rescue mission, called it an “authentic odyssey. ” The animals, he said, will now have proper food and medical care, “without living in constant danger of a nearby war zone and noise of bomb blasts in the background. ” Mr. Khalil visited the Mosul zoo in February to check on the animals and organize regular feedings for them. His group’s previous attempt to rescue the two animals failed when workers carrying them were stopped at a checkpoint. The aid workers were asked to leave Mosul. Lula and Simba were sent back to the zoo. “We never got to know the exact details why we were not allowed to pass, but, of course, transporting large wild animals in an area with such a complex political situation is not easy,” Mr. Khalil said Wednesday in a telephone interview. Mr. Khalil said Islamic State militants had been at the zoo and had painted over a sign with the animals’ faces. He said he had heard criticism about his attention to the animals at a time when so many people were suffering. “I like this kind of criticism,” he said, “because in my opinion humanity cannot be divided. ” He said Simba and Lula were a symbol of that humanity. “War rages on but all those fighting cannot ignore animals, put them in a cage, starve them to death, deprive them of water,” he said. Simba and Lula’s new home will be the New Hope Center, the biggest wildlife shelter in the Middle East.",0
20146,20146,"Oroville Is a Warning for California Dams, as Climate Change Adds Stress - The New York Times",Adam Nagourney and Henry Fountain,"LOS ANGELES  —   The St. Francis Dam was a proud symbol of California’s engineering might and elaborate water system  —   until just before midnight on March 12, 1928, when it collapsed, killing more than 400 people in a devastating wall of water. Ever since, the state has had a reputation of diligent inspections as it has built the largest network of major public dams in the nation. But the threat of catastrophic flooding from the damaged Oroville Dam in Northern California this week  —   forcing the evacuation of nearly 200, 000 people because of what environmental groups had asserted in 2005 was a design flaw  —   presented a warning sign for California, where a network of dams and waterways is suffering from age and stress. It also demonstrated that older dams may not be designed to deal with the severe weather patterns California has experienced because of global warming. The Oroville Dam was completed in 1968, toward the end of the golden era of dam building. The culprit at Oroville was a faulty emergency spillway, used for the first time since the dam was opened after days of drenching storms, driven by what are known as atmospheric rivers, that filled the reservoir to capacity. But engineers and environmentalists said similar problems could occur at many of the roughly 1, 500 dams that dot this state. “We are not maintaining the water infrastructure adequately,” said Peter H. Gleick, a founder of the Pacific Institute, a think tank dedicated to water issues. “We are not maintaining it in Flint, Mich. and we are not maintaining it at our big dams in California. We need to spend more money and time on maintaining these. ” Of the 1, 585 dams in California, 17 are listed in poor condition and 97 in fair condition, according to the National Inventory of Dams, which is kept by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. There are about 90, 000 dams across the nation, many of which are privately owned. Part of the problem, officials said, is that as a rule, the government is more inclined to invest money in building new projects, celebrated with elaborate   ceremonies overseen by elected officials, than in the less visible (and less glamorous) task of maintenance. “That is a national concern for us,” said Lori Spragens, the executive director of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials. “Most dams are almost 50 years old. Many of them are very behind in their rehabilitation and they need to be upgraded to current standards. It’s the lack of money. The whole concern with infrastructure is just not there, as we know. ” Climate change adds to the challenges. Scientists have said for years that a warming atmosphere should lead to more intense and frequent storms in many regions. In California, where precipitation in the Sierra Nevada is the source of much of the state’s water, warming also means that more of the moisture in a given storm falls as water and less as snow, adding to the immediate burden on downstream reservoirs. This has been the rainiest year in California’s history, a   turn after a   drought of historic proportions had transformed some reservoirs into brown fields of cracked, dry earth. The wet winter season does not end until April more storms are expected this week across California. And as the state’s vast Sierra Nevada snowpack gradually melts, it will keep feeding reservoirs into the late spring. California has the additional complication of being laced with earthquake faults, which has always been a major challenge to engineers designing dams. Among the dams now considered to be at risk are two that are close to earthquake faults and are undergoing improvements to better withstand seismic shocks: The Anderson Dam and the Calaveras Dam, both near San Jose. But California’s most troubled large dam is at Lake Isabella, built in the 1950s on what was thought to be a dormant earthquake fault by the Army Corps of Engineers on the Kern River above Bakersfield. The fault has since been shown to be active, and out of concerns that the dam could fail, the authorities restricted the level of the lake behind it. This week, officials assured nearby residents that despite heavy rains, the lake levels, and the dam itself, remained safe. But the dam will have to be rebuilt, with a new emergency spillway, at a cost expected to be about half a billion dollars. Construction is expected to start this year and to take at least five years. Isabella is an example of how dam spillways designed more than a   ago are now often inadequate, said Blake P. Tullis, a professor of civil engineering at Utah State University who has worked on the design of the new spillway. Climate change is part of the problem, he said, but other factors, like land use changes  —   more parking lots, for example, mean more runoff into rivers  —   and better weather data have also played a role. “Now, as you do your statistical analysis, the biggest flood you could predict actually happening is much bigger,” Dr. Tullis said. “People are scrambling a bit, asking how we maintain dam safety. ” The problems in Oroville, a community 70 miles north of Sacramento, are particularly unsettling because California has been in the    business for a long time. And no one forgets the lessons of the collapse of St. Francis, whose design was overseen by William Mulholland, a Los Angeles engineer whose career was destroyed by the tragedy. “I would say California is the No. 1 best,” said Joseph D. Countryman, who worked for 20 years as the head of reservoir operations for the Army Corps of Engineers. Still, he added, no matter how much experience or money a   might have, something can always go wrong, especially in a state like this that can go from five years of severe drought to oceans of water falling from the sky. “When you build a dam, you are playing God,” he said. “And it’s tough to be God. ” In the case of Oroville, environmental groups in 2005 opposed the relicensing of the dam by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, saying the emergency spillway should be lined with concrete to ensure its durability if regulators needed to release water to relieve pressure on the dam. The federal agency, backed by the state authority that owns the reservoir, said it was unnecessary. “The management of the dam  —   the management of water  —   is risk management,” said Nancy Vogel, a spokeswoman for the California Natural Resources Agency. “You have to weigh risks and you have to calculate what is a good expenditure and what isn’t. ” Several engineers said it seemed likely that this episode would show the need for something that elected officials have rarely rallied around: spending money on maintenance, rather than new building. The scare came as President Trump has said he will propose some kind of infrastructure program. California has submitted $100 billion worth of projects it would like funded it includes work on the state’s water system, but it is for new work, including raising the Folsom Dam northeast of Sacramento. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said at a news conference that the administration was watching the events in California and that the crisis “was a textbook example of why we need to pursue a major infrastructure package in Congress. ” The events in Oroville are a reminder that everything about a dam  —   from building it to maintaining it  —   is challenging, in no small part because the stakes of a mistake are so high. “Of course it shouldn’t happen,” Mr. Countryman said. “It doesn’t mean it could have been stopped from happening. ” “We went from drought to flood disaster overnight,” he added. “Don’t we get a little break from fearing one thing to fearing another thing?”",0
20147,20147,House Passes Bill To Repeal and Replace Post-Crisis Wall Street Rules - Breitbart,John Carney,"The House of Representatives on Thursday passed legislation to   and replace many of the financial regulations enacted during the Obama administration in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis. [The House passed the Financial Choice Act by a vote of 233 to 186, with Republican lawmakers in support and Democrats opposed.  The Choice Act is an ambitious piece of legislation that would replace many of the complex rules created by the   Act of 2010 with a new paradigm of regulation. The bill would allow banks that fund their operations with capital beyond a certain threshold to step into a   system of regulation in which the amount of supervisory oversight would be greatly reduced.

20148,20148,Inside ‘Bill Clinton Inc.’: Hacked Memo Shows Intersection of Clinton Profits and Charity,nan,"Inside ‘Bill Clinton Inc.’: Hacked Memo Shows Intersection of Clinton Profits and Charity Posted on Oct 28, 2016 
A 2011 memo from top Bill Clinton aide Douglas Band, published by WikiLeaks, details “a circle of enrichment in which [Band] raised money for the Clinton Foundation from top-tier corporations such as Dow Chemical and Coca-Cola that were clients of his firm, Teneo, while pressing many of those same donors to provide personal income to the former president,” reports The Washington Post. 
The Post continues: 
The system has drawn scrutiny from Republicans [and progressives], who say it allowed corporations and other wealthy supporters to pay for entree to a popular former president and a onetime secretary of state who is now the Democratic presidential nominee. … 
The memo, made public Wednesday by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, lays out the aggressive strategy behind lining up the consulting contracts and paid speaking engagements for Bill Clinton that added tens of millions of dollars to the family’s fortune, including during the years that Hillary Clinton led the State Department. It describes how Band helped run what he called “Bill Clinton Inc.,” obtaining “in-kind services for the President and his family — for personal travel, hospitality, vacation and the like.” 
Band grew close to Clinton during the ’90s as his personal aide in the White House and became “the architect of his post-presidential activities,” the Post reports. In the memo, Band argues that his work and the work of his firm benefited the former president and his family’s foundation: 
“We have dedicated ourselves to helping the President secure and engage in for-profit activities,” Band wrote. He added that he had “sought to leverage my activities, including my partner role at Teneo, to support and to raise funds for the foundation.” 
The Post continues: 
Band’s memo provided data showing how much money each of Teneo’s 20 clients at the time had given to the Clinton Foundation, how much they had paid Bill Clinton and, in some cases, how he or Kelly had personally forged the relationships that resulted in the payments. 
Band wrote that Teneo partners had raised in excess of $8 million for the foundation and $3 million in paid speaking fees for Bill Clinton. He said he had secured contracts for the former president that would pay out $66 million over the subsequent nine years if the deals remained in place. 
For instance, Band wrote that Kelly arranged for the former president to meet the chief executive of Coca-Cola in January 2009 at the Clintons’ home in Washington. In all, according to Band’s memo, Coke had contributed $4.33 million to the foundation between 2004 and 2010. … 
Band also described how Kelly helped expand a fruitful relationship with UBS Global Wealth Management, introducing Bill Clinton to a top executive at a 2009 charity dinner. In the ensuing years, UBS upped its giving to the foundation, signed on as a Teneo client and agreed to pay Bill Clinton for speeches, Band wrote. 
Records show UBS paid Clinton about $2 million in speaking fees between 2011 and 2015 for a series of appearances, generally alongside former president George W. Bush. The company also paid Hillary Clinton $225,000 for a 2013 speech. … 
Another achievement cited by Band: Laureate International Universities, a chain of for-profit international colleges, which donated to the foundation and agreed to pay Bill Clinton $3.5 million a year to serve as honorary chancellor. 
Companies aligned with the Clinton Foundation paid several million dollars to Teneo for consulting services. The Post reports that a spike in payments from Dow “raised red flags for an internal company fraud investigator, who expressed alarm that it may be linked to Bill Clinton’s work with a charity founded by Liveris—a charge the company denied.” The investigator wrote: “It appears Dow is paying Teneo for connections with Clinton.”",1

20150,20150,TV Exec: NBC Made ‘Fundamental Mistake’ Thinking Megyn Kelly Was ‘Superstar’ - Breitbart,Tony Lee,"NBC News made a “fundamental mistake” when its network executives thought Megyn Kelly was a “super star,” according to a television executive CNN interviewed.  Kelly, the former Fox News talent, has come under fire for her interview with Alex Jones, which is set to air on this Sunday on her Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly show. “They’ve made a fundamental mistake about Megyn which is they think she’s a super star,” the television executive reportedly told CNN. “What she is is a cable star, and that is a very different solar system. ” While promoting her show, Kelly told numerous outlets that she felt like she was born to be a mainstream media star. In a leaked recording that was released this week, Kelly even tells Alex Jones, “I’m a combination of Mike Wallace, Oprah Winfrey and Larry the Cable Guy. ” Kelly was resoundingly mocked after Jones released the audio. Mainstream media reporters and the families of the Sandy Hook victims also lambasted Kelly for telling Jones in the leaked audio, “It’s not gonna be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that. ” CNN boss Jeff Zucker said that Kelly’s interview will only work if she is “holding up a picture of the dead kids at Sandy Hook and saying, ‘How dare you? ’” But as the New York Times observed, “NBC has not released a transcript of Ms. Kelly’s interview, leading some to speculate that her interrogation of Mr. Jones over his more contentious views  —   for instance, that Sandy Hook was a hoax and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were carried out by the United States government  —   was less than ferocious. ” As CNN pointed out, the first month of Kelly’s show has shown that wanting to be [Barbara] Walters, [Diane] Sawyer or [Oprah] Winfrey does not necessarily make it so. Establishing that reputation takes years. And in Kelly’s case, it requires a transformation from her former role as a cable news host in the center of the political fray into someone more trusted by the general public. ” “Had a trusted broadcast talent like Diane Sawyer or Lester Holt interviewed Jones, audiences may have given them greater benefit of the doubt,” CNN noted. “Critics of Kelly’s interview might have waited to see a Sawyer or Holt interview air before casting judgment based on a brief promo. ” After her supposedly “ ” interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kelly did not receive stellar reviews even from her new mainstream media peers. Her interview with Erin Andrews for her second show did not draw rave reviews either. And despite NBC ginning up the hype machine in overdrive, Kelly’s ratings have tanked. Her debut show could not even beat out a rerun of 60 Minutes. Her second show lost to another rerun of 60 Minutes and could not even beat out a rerun of America’s Funniest Home Videos.  According to reports, NBC executives are realizing already that “people are not tuning in to watch Megyn. ” NBC executives are reportedly “freaking out” over the “ratings disaster” that Kelly has turned out to be, questioning the network’s $15 million investment in Kelly.",0

20152,20152,Firebombs and Accusations Fly in ‘Ruthless’ Election Campaigns in Mexico - The New York Times,Kirk Semple and Paulina Villegas,"MEXICO CITY  —   Trailing badly in the polls, and with elections just around the corner, Roxana Luna reached for transcendental salvation. In a ceremony outside the government headquarters of Mexico’s Puebla State, Ms. Luna, a candidate for governor, unleashed a troupe of Aztec dancers across the colonial building’s cobblestone forecourt. They hopped around wearing leather skirts and spectacular feather headdresses. One drew designs in the air with smoke from burning tree resin. Another blew a conch shell. Ms. Luna explained to bemused onlookers that the event last week was a purification ritual intended to flush out “the curse” of bad government, along with fear, coercion, vote buying, apathy and violence. “People who feel desperate turn to ritualistic cleansings,” she said. “We’ve been cursed. ” It is election time in Mexico again, with voters going to the polls on Sunday for municipal and regional elections, including the governorships in 12 of Mexico’s 32 states. While some might quibble with Ms. Luna’s technique, few would argue against her appeal to clean up Mexico’s electoral politics. Mexican political campaigns have never been for the faint of heart, and this year has been no different, with    contests that have made a certain presidential contest north of the border look almost quaint in comparison. The official campaign period in Mexico, which by law lasted only two months and ended on Wednesday, was marked by “a dirty war,” to use the favored term of the Mexican news media and political class. Candidates all over the country have hurled accusations of corruption at one another, including charges of graft and financing by drug traffickers. In the governor’s race in Veracruz, one candidate even accused his main competitor of being a pedophile. Some contests also featured violence and intimidation, including the firebombing of a party leader’s office in Veracruz. Dozens of local and regional candidates withdrew from races, reportedly because of threats from drug traffickers. A lot is at stake. More than 1, 300 seats are up for grabs, with the governorships the most important. The outcome of Sunday’s vote could also serve as a prologue for the 2018 presidential election. President Enrique Peña Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party holds nine of the 12 contested governorships, but he is polling lower than any president in the past two decades, and his plummeting popularity could hurt his party’s chances on Sunday. Luis Carlos Ugalde, the director of Integralia Consultores, a political consultancy in Mexico City, said the level of invective and the prevalence of corruption allegations had increased in recent electoral cycles. This year’s tone was “the most negative” he had seen, he said. The rancor of the current campaigns is likely to influence the tenor of the presidential election, said Mr. Ugalde, who served as president of Mexico’s election commission in the 2000s. “This could cause a very troubled atmosphere in 2018,” he predicted. Arguably, the most contentious race this year has been for governor in Veracruz, a state wracked by corruption and violence. The   are two cousins who, despite their family ties, have lobbed accusations and insults at each other. Héctor Yunes Landa, the candidate for the incumbent Institutional Revolutionary Party, has accused his opponent, Miguel Ángel Yunes Linares, the candidate of a coalition between the Democratic Revolution Party and the National Action Party, of being a pedophile, warning voters to “take care of the safety of your children,” according to local news media. Mr. Yunes Linares, who is trying to break the rival party’s   hold on the state’s governorship, has denied the charges. Officials in Mr. Yunes Linares’s campaign have accused his cousin of vote buying and of underreporting his wealth in a public declaration of his assets. Mr. Yunes Linares’s chances may have improved in light of a recent investigation by the news site Animal Político, which found that the state’s current administration funneled about $35 million to ghost companies. The governor, Javier Duarte, has denied any wrongdoing. In the northern border state of Tamaulipas, the leading candidates for governor and their parties have been accused of having links to drug cartels. The Institutional Revolutionary Party’s candidate for governor, Baltazar Hinojosa Ochoa, has been accused of receiving money from the Gulf Cartel during a mayoral run in 2002 in the municipality of Matamoros. He has denied the allegations. Mr. Hinojosa Ochoa’s party has accused his main rival, Francisco García Cabeza de Vaca, the candidate for the National Action Party, of having his own links to organized crime. To support its accusations, the Institutional Revolutionary Party submitted a photo to government investigators showing gunmen riding around in a truck decorated with the symbol of the rival party. A Revolutionary Party official later admitted that the photograph had been taken in another state and, in any case, had been doctored. Candidates for governor in several other states  —   including Chihuahua, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo and Sinaloa  —   have also had to parry accusations of corruption and links to organized crime. The war of words has been punctuated by violent threats and attacks. On Tuesday, a group of armed attackers firebombed the offices of the Veracruz state leader for the National Action Party. “These are the costs of challenging a corrupt, unscrupulous system,” the party leader, José de Jesús Mancha, said in a statement after the bombing. In Puebla, an official from the Institutional Revolutionary Party was wounded in a shooting while he was driving. A party leader, Jorge Estefan Chidiac, blamed the state administration, led by the National Action Party, for the attack, saying it “was part of a strategy of the state government to destabilize, intimidate and threaten the people of Puebla. ” National Action Party officials denied responsibility. In Sinaloa, a candidate for the state legislature said his house had been shot at, and an office linked to the campaign of a mayoral candidate was ransacked by burglars, according to local news media accounts. In Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa, someone spray painted death threats against a candidate for governor on the walls of a university. During a radio interview on Thursday, Miguel Ángel Osorio Chong, Mexico’s interior secretary, called the campaign period “the most ruthless of any electoral processes. ” “I don’t understand this kind of democracy,” he said. “I believe in competition, and when there’s an accusation and there are problems, you have to say something. But it went too far. ”",0

20154,20154,"U.S. Immigration Policy Helped Grow India’s Economy, Says Study",John Binder,"United States immigration policies helped grow India’s economy, a new, academic study claims. [In a new study by the University of California, San Diego and the University of Michigan, states that the   visa has led to an Indian economic boom.

Most recently, that number has ballooned to potentially hundreds of thousands each year, as universities and   are exempt from the cap. With more entering the U.

As the Center for Immigration Studies noted, the vast majority of   visas allotted every year are given to foreign nationals from India who primarily enter the IT sector. In the academic study, researchers found that current policy aided India’s tech boom so much, that the country eventually surpassed the U.

20156,20156,"Comment on “If Trump Loses, I’m Grabbing My Musket”: Former Congressman Ready to Go Full Revolution by Lakshmima",Lakshmima,"Posted on October 28, 2016 by Mac Slavo 
This election remains more heated than any other in modern history – and for many, it has become a call to arms, even if only metaphorically. 
Despite the fact that DNC operatives have been exposed as the ones inciting violence at rallies – Robert Creamer and Scott Foval for example – and working overtime to bus in illegal voters and rig the vote – the media is going out of its way to paint Trump supporters and grassroots Americans as the ones plotting violence. 
Most recently, they are latching onto comments made by former congressman Joe Walsh, now a conservative radio host, who suggested he would ‘pick up a musket’ if Trump loses the election. On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. 
On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. 
You in? 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
Did Walsh mean to imply violence? That is certainly how the media is portraying it, as his comments spark controversy and fuel fire to the debate over the nearing election. 
The irony that his commentary drew from the imagery of founding-era patriots who stood up to tyranny was deeply lost on the left, who see opponents to Hillary in black and white terms – racist, xenophobic, utterly deplorable and inherently violent. 
CNN followed up, asking Walsh what he meant by statement. 
via CNN : 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
[…] 
Walsh … did respond to CNN’s Jake Tapper via Twitter when he asked: “What exactly does that mean?” 
“It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back,” he responded to Tapper. @jaketapper It means protesting. Participating in acts of civil disobedience. Doing what it takes to get our country back. 
— Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) October 26, 2016 
After a firestorm on social media, Walsh doubled down, stating on Twitter: I'm serious. I don't think a musket would do much good these days, but it's time for civil disobedience on the right. https://t.co/ThJPEbALWZ

His heated rhetoric is a response to the endless episodes of fraud , dirty tricks and foul play by the Hillary campaign, as it seems that she will stop at nothing to become the first female POTUS – just the sort of abuse of power that the founders warned about. 
1775-76 erupted in response to a long train of abuses – acts of oppression and hostility listed in the Declaration of Independence that is being largely repeated in modern day America. 
Could Hillary’s reported election victory – or Donald Trump’s defeat – signal civil unrest and a new wave of resistance, particularly if the results are widely viewed as fraudulent or “rigged”? Trump, for one, has certainly been talking up the possibility of a stolen election. 
The scenario is plausible enough that the Pentagon and Homeland Security have been carrying out secret drills in the lead up to the election to prepare for the possibility of a martial law response to violence or civil unrest. 
As SHTF detailed in an exclusive report, a whistleblower has come forward on the ominous contingency plan to keep and/or restore order if the populace revolt against the establishment’s “selection” for president: 
If there is any truth to it, the 2016 election could be a kick-off for total tyranny. 
According to an unnamed source – who has provided accurate intel in the past – an unannounced military drill is scheduled to take place during a period leading up to the election and throughout the month after. 
Date: October 30th – 30 days after the election Suspected Region: Northeast, specifically New York 
1st Phase: NROL (No Rule of Law) – drill involving combat arms in metro areas (active and reserve). Source says active duty and reserve service members are being vaccinated as if they are being deployed in theatre.

At this point, no one can say for certain what will happen in the aftermath of November 8, but it is clear that millions and millions of Americans are dissatisfied with the status quo, troubled about the economic realities perpetuated by the Fed and angry that Hillary may be put in the Oval Office rather than a jail cell, despite a trail of corruption with virtually no end.

20159,20159,New Solar Panels Pull Drinking Water From The Air Because Clean Water Is A Human Right,Starkman,"Email 
In an exciting new development, a startup company called Zero Mass Water has created solar panels that passively and efficiently pull water from the sky, purify it, and transport it to the tap for drinking and cooking purposes. These solar panels are seriously changing the game for both tap water and clean energy. 
Via TrueActivist SPONSORED LINKS 
Though the primary motivation for creating these panels was to help people living without access to clean drinking water, it can also help a variety of people from all walks of life while conserving traditional energy that is bad for the environment . Scroll Down For Video Below 
The founder and CEO of the startup, Cody Friesen, said he was inspired when he was setting up another one of his technologies in Indonesia and thought about the abundance of rain, but lack of clean water in the region. He decided to focus his efforts on improving the global water supply. Friesen told Fastco Exist: 
“Everybody’s heard about the latest nanofilter this…or whatever the latest pump technology is. None of those end up being sort of the leapfrog technology that addresses the fact that drinking water is a fundamental human right, and yet we have one person dying every 10 seconds from waterborne illness on the planet.” 
Though these are the first solar panels of their kind, the idea and technology behind the water conversion and supply is simple. Zero Mass Water created a material that absorbs water from the air at an extremely accelerated rate, then it draws the water back out to evaporate it and draw out pollutants. After this purification process, the distilled water is run through a mineral block to add calcium and magnesium and to improve the taste. 
Since waterborne illnesses are so prevalent, this water can save millions of lives and slowly eliminate diseases, as it becomes more widely-used by countries suffering the most as a result of contaminated drinking water . Having an in-home water supply would also save girls and women worldwide approximately 200 million hours annually , as that’s how much time they spend retrieving water. They could use this time to go to school, perform more tasks around the house, or work. 
The solar panels are currently being tested in Ecuador, Jordan, and Mexico to test their viability and effectiveness. Though they’re starting out in areas rampant with poverty , the panels can also make a difference in the lives of the citizens whose water supplies are tainted with lead. There are roughly 5,300 such water systems, and this could be a safe alternative to drinking that lethal tap water and buying bottled water. 
A single panel can provide enough clean drinking and cooking water for a family of 4, and additional panels can be used on larger buildings, such as hospitals. 
Zero Mass Water hopes that this concept won’t remain novel for too long; despite the success they’re likely to have for being the only sellers of this panel, their goal is to make the technology common throughout all solar panels installed in people’s homes. 
“When you think about solar today, what do you think about? Electricity,” Friesen said. “Everybody thinks that way. I think that in a few years when people think about solar, they’ll also think about water abundance.”",1
20160,20160,Vatican Hires Lawyers to Protect Pope’s Image,Breitbart London,"VATICAN CITY (AP)  —   God’s love may be free, but the Vatican says it has a copyright on the pope. [Unnerved by the proliferation of     snow globes and tea towels around the world, the Vatican has warned it intends to “protect” the image of Pope Francis and “stop situations of illegality that may be discovered. ” It also wants to protect the crossed keys emblem of the Holy See.  “The secretary of state will undertake systematic surveillance aimed at monitoring the way in which the image of the Holy Father and the emblems of the Holy See are used, intervening with opportune measures when necessary,” the Vatican said in a statement. To back up this declaration, the Vatican has hired the global law firm Baker McKenzie to protect its intellectual property rights, the Italian daily Corriere della Sera reported. without citing the source of the information. Baker McKenzie declined to comment. The threat of enforcement marks a sea change for a church that for some 2, 000 years has seen popes venerated on all manner of flags, banners and medals. But the popularity of Francis and the ease with which his image can be copied in the internet age has spawned a flood of papal trinkets, causing the Holy See to worry that they are losing control of his image. “The pope’s image rights are no different from those of any other famous celebrity and so it’s not surprising that the Vatican is giving notice that it will protect its (intellectual property) rights as necessary,” said Nick Kounoupias, the founder of an intellectual property consultancy in London. “What will be interesting to see, however, is how vigorously these rights are pursued, given who the IP owner is. ” Francis’ many travels have taken him to countries like the Philippines and Sri Lanka, where factories can quickly churn out pope hats,   and towels. Vatican officials have grown fearful the faithful will think that the church is making money off the merchandise, experts say. Worse still, they see the conditions in which some of the items are made and worry about being associated with labor abuses. The decision reflects an evolution in the last decade as the Vatican adapted to modern markets. While in the past the Holy See might get word of improper use of the pope’s image through local church organizations around the globe, the approach was random. “It’s not new that people were selling   of the pope, but (previously) those were probably little local vendors,” said Mark McKenna, an intellectual property expert at the Notre Dame Law School in Indiana. What’s changed is the magnitude of what can be produced and how quickly it can be distributed through online platforms. “In a world of Etsy, you are able to do it on a bigger scale,” he said. Although the Vatican did not elaborate on how it would crack down, the warning seemed a   move to explain why the Vatican is going after the unauthorized commercial uses of the pope’s image. There was no immediate indication that souvenir buyers would risk fines or legal action. It’s not as if the church refrains from selling its own   material. On the Vatican website, one can buy Francis medals, icons and rosary boxes. The Vatican museum boutiques offer silk ties and scarves and watches showing scenes from Michelangelo’s frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. And that may be part of the Vatican’s motivation in safeguarding Francis’ face  —   and warning that they will challenge the copycats. “It’s probably also the case that there is some genuine commercial motivation,” McKenna said. “They want to be sure they’re the only ones selling this stuff. ”",0
20161,20161,DEVELOPING: FBI Reopens Investigation into Clinton Emails After New ‘Pertinent’ Evidence Discovered,Jenna Leigh Richardson,"The Clinton email scandal has taken an unexpected twist Friday as Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey notified key members of Congress that the agency will be reopening their investigation against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
In a letter to Congress, Comey wrote that the FBI has recently “ learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation” regarding Clinton’s use of a private server during her tenure at the State Department.
While Comey did not elaborate on what those emails contain, the director that the emails were discovered “in connection with an unrelated case.” 
Via FoxNews 
He told lawmakers the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier, “and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.”
He said the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete “this additional work.”
Trump, speaking to cheering supporters Friday afternoon in Manchester, N.H., praised the FBI for having the “courage” to “right the horrible mistake that they made” – saying he hopes that is “corrected.”
“Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,” Trump said. “We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.”
In a nod to the significance of the FBI’s announcement, Trump quipped: “The rest of my speech is going to be so boring.”
We will continue to update as new details surface.

20162,20162,Data Points to Rapid Loss of Control Aboard EgyptAir Jet - The New York Times,"Kareem Fahim, Marc Santora and Nicola Clark","CAIRO  —   A piece of luggage adrift in the Mediterranean Sea. Floating nearby, a passenger seat from a plane. Scraps of metal, scattered personal belongings and, finally, the grim discovery of human remains. As the investigation continued Friday into what caused an EgyptAir flight from Paris to Cairo to suddenly and violently plunge from the sky, the discovery of the debris allowed search crews to home in on the location of the crash  —   an area about 180 miles north of Alexandria, Egypt  —   even as its cause remained a mystery and the subject of intense speculation. Data that was transmitted from the aircraft to operators on the ground, published Friday by a respected aviation journal, revealed a rapid loss of control, with alarms and   failures in the seconds before the plane was lost from radar. The transmissions are evidence of a catastrophic failure, but do not answer the crucial question: What caused it? Why would a plane with a good safety record and experienced pilots fall from the sky on a clear spring night? No bulk wreckage has been found, and the parts of the aircraft most likely to provide clues for investigators  —   including the voice and data recorders  —   are also the ones most likely to quickly sink to the seafloor. An Egyptian official has said that investigators consider terrorism to be one possible cause of the disaster, but no terrorist group has claimed responsibility. Officials cautioned that there was no direct evidence to suggest a bomb aboard the plane, or any other deliberate act of sabotage. The plane, a   Airbus A320 jet, went down Thursday while flying through a cloudless night sky en route to Cairo from Paris. The Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority provided what a spokesman called a definitive timeline on the disaster. The agency reported that the flight was proceeding normally at 1:48 a. m. Cairo time on Thursday, when Greek traffic controllers last spoke with the pilot, who seemed in good spirits. At 2:27 a. m. when the plane was passing from Greek to   airspace, the controllers in Athens tried and failed repeatedly to reach the pilots by radio. Even attempts on an emergency frequency failed. At the same time, technical data was being transmitted from the plane automatically through its Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or Acars, which modern jetliners use to provide status updates to maintenance and operational centers on the ground. Representatives of Airbus and the Federal Aviation Administration said they could not confirm the authenticity of the technical signals. Dina   a spokeswoman for EgyptAir, declined to comment on the apparently leaked data. “We cannot say anything, because we have already launched a committee to investigate the crash,” she said. “It hasn’t told us anything until now. ” The data, first reported on AVHerald. com, is written tersely in abbreviations and codes. Robert W. Mann, a former airline executive and an industry analyst, said the jargon in the messages told a compelling, although incomplete, story. At 2:26 a. m. a message indicated that the right cockpit window had been opened. This could have been done to vent smoke, Mr. Mann said, or something else could have caused the breach. Over the next two minutes, there were two smoke indications, one in a bathroom and another in the avionics bay, the part of the plane where much of its electronic equipment is housed. Mr. Mann cautioned that these messages did not necessarily mean that there was a fire. The messages could also have been prompted by rapid decompression of the aircraft, which can produce condensation that the plane’s sensors could mistake for smoke. Finally at 2:29, there were two more alerts having to do with the plane’s flight control computer systems. “The last two are troubling,” Mr. Mann said. “You are starting to really see things rapidly degrade. ” First, there was a problem with the autoflight control computer. The jet would have been flying near its maximum speed and elevation at that time. That is the most efficient way for jetliners to fly, and it is safe, but pilots prefer to rely on autopilot systems in those conditions because if they were to ever lose control of the plane, it could be hard to regain, Mr. Mann said. That is why pilots sometimes call those conditions the “coffin corner. ” The last message had to do with the spoiler elevator controller, which essentially controls the flaps responsible for pitch and roll control. The computer controlling these failed as well. “It looks to me like you have a progressive flight control system failure,” Mr. Mann said. It is over the course of two minutes, which might have seemed like an eternity on that plane, but is relatively fast. This is also the moment that the plane left Greek airspace, and at 2:29:40 a. m. Greek controllers lost the aircraft’s trace, just inside Egyptian airspace, about halfway between Crete and Egypt. Around this time, the plane made a   turn to the left and then a full circle to the right, dropping precipitously to 15, 000 feet from 37, 000 and then plunging again to 9, 000 feet before it disappeared from radar. The crew never gave any indication of a technical problem or other difficulties on board, even during the final, fatal minutes when the plane itself was transmitting data indicating a catastrophic failure. One former crash investigator said that radar evidence pointing to a series of sharp maneuvers in the moments before radar contact was lost suggested that the plane was almost certainly not under the control of the pilots. Whatever upset the Airbus was so sudden and violent that it could not be compensated for by the plane’s automated safety systems. “In my mind, this basically opens two axes of possibility: either a sudden technical problem or some kind of illicit or terrorist act,” said the expert, Alain Bouillard, a former chief investigator for the French Bureau of Investigations and Analyses. Given the limited amount of evidence available so far, experts said it was difficult to say with any certainty what kind of technical failure could have brought the plane down. One possibility, Mr. Bouillard said, might be a malfunction in the plane’s cabin pressurization systems that could have caused the fuselage to rupture. At high altitude, such a rupture could be potentially catastrophic if the crew was unable to initiate a controlled descent to a lower altitude and make an emergency landing. If the inquiry fails to uncover strong evidence of a technical problem, experts said the possibility of a more sinister chain of events would most likely take prominence. But given the circumstances of this accident, particularly in the absence of a claim of responsibility by a terrorist group or intelligence pointing to a perpetrator, it could take months to prove with any certainty that it was a terrorist act. An initial review of the passengers aboard against American terrorist watch lists have found no matches, according to Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who has received several briefings on the investigation. The Islamic State, considered the most likely group behind the attack, is normally quick to announce its role, as it did last fall after the crash of a Russian flight over Egypt’s Sinai Desert. “It’s important to note that attribution in the theater of terrorism is crucial,” said Michael S. Smith II, a managing partner of Kronos Advisory, a firm specializing in terrorism research. What may be most valuable to investigators  —   and perhaps far more difficult to recover  —   is material that would have quickly sunk to the seafloor. If that debris is scattered over a wide area, and the pieces are relatively small, it would suggest that the plane broke up in the air  —   supporting the theory of an onboard explosion. However, if the debris field is concentrated in a relatively small area, that would indicate that the aircraft hit the surface of the water largely intact. The plane’s two data recorders, or “black boxes,” if they can be recovered, would also provide important clues. The shock wave of an onboard explosion, for example, may have been captured by the microphones of the cockpit voice recorder, experts said such a blast would also instantly disable the flight data recorder. In the event of a technical failure, Mr. Bouillard said, the data recorder  —   which tracks information including the plane’s position, speed, altitude and direction  —   would normally continue to function until the moment of impact. Officials could also not rule out that one of the pilots intentionally brought down the plane. The flight track of the Airbus on Thursday indicated that it crashed halfway between Crete and Egypt, which could mean it landed on what scientists refer to as the Mediterranean Ridge. The ridge has been pushed upward by the African plate of the earth’s crust sliding under the Aegean Sea, deforming and crumbling the seafloor, said William B. F. Ryan, a scientist at the   Earth Observatory at Columbia University who has studied the Mediterranean seafloor. The water there is about 1. 5 miles deep, and picking out wreckage at the bottom from among the bumps, which are perhaps 50 to 100 feet in size, could be complex, he said. If the plane crashed farther to the south, the wreckage would lie on a smoother plain at a depth between 1. 7 and 2 miles, Dr. Ryan said. In that case, the search would go faster  —   and the   answer to what caused the crash could come quicker.",0
20163,20163,Popular Theme Park Water Ride Malfunctions… Ends In Brutal Death Of 4 Patrons,K. Campbell,"WATCH: Insane School Teachers Push Girls Into Snake Pit to Teach “Character Lesson” 
Their injuries were perceived as so severe by theme park staff and paramedics that Gavin Fuller of Queensland Ambulance described it as “incompatible with living.” 
The mother of Kate Godchild and Luke Dorsett, two of the victims, said that their family was “absolutely devastated” by the tragic and gruesome loss of their loved ones. 
“I have three children and have lost two of them today — my whole family has been wiped out,” the traumatized mother said.   
Dorsett’s partner, Roozi Araghi, was also killed in the incident, as well as a 42-year-old woman who has not yet been publicly identified. 
Authorities have been reviewing video footage of the attraction to see what exactly caused the deadly malfunction, but others who visited the attraction that day have noted that the ride’s seat belt situation was questionable. 
Jesse Lovett, a park-goer who was on the water attraction with his 2-year-old daughter an hour before the fatal accident, was concerned that the flimsy hook-and-loop strap wasn’t doing enough to keep them inside the raft. 
“It’s so rough and you had to hold it really tight … the strap did nothing and easily came undone because it was wet,” he explained.  ",1
20164,20164,Donald Trump May Not Deliver on Campaign Promises,Katherine,"On Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016, Republican lawmakers arranged to meet with President-elect Donald Trump’s advisors to talk about another, less expensive, option to his “mighty wall.” The President-elect also consistently told his supporters he would dismantle Obama Care, but now he says that he is open to keeping the Affordable Care Act. This recent waffling could be an indicator that he will not deliver on his campaign promises.
The day after he won the election, he was given his first test by his own party. According to top aides for Trump, there is a compromise that would include more federal border patrol officers, and extend the border fence. The idea is to extend parts of the border with a double layered fence. An official from the Department of Homeland Security and a Republican from the House of Representatives said Trump’s wall is improbable; it would have to be built through rivers and lakes, rough terrain and private property. It would also block the view of border agents. This wall would make it difficult to watch the border. According to the House Aid, the meeting will take place as soon as his transition team is set. The spokesperson would not offer any comment on the meeting or compromise plan from the lawmakers. Mexico again said the day after the election they would not pay for his wall. The wall has never been mentioned officially, but if Congress takes a stand against Trump it will be an extension of the fence once proposed by Secretary Clinton.
According to the House aide, the meeting will take place as soon as the transition team is set. The spokesperson would not comment on the meeting or the compromise from lawmakers. Mexico again stated, the day after the election, they will not pay for his wall. This boundary has not been mentioned officially, but if Congress takes a stand against Trump it will be an extension of the fence, once proposed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Another key focus of the presidential campaign was immigration. It was stated that illegal immigrants are stealing American jobs and pose a security risk to the nation. Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Michael McCaul called the idea of the wall, an emotional unthinking reaction to a highly sensitive issue, or a “knee-jerk reaction.” Another indication that the president-elect will not deliver on his campaign promises.
The day after the election Marie Keating, a first-grade teacher in California, asked her 10 students what they wanted to ask new President-elect Trump. One student said she did not want her family to be sent back to Mexico. This statement prompted Keating to have her class write letters telling Trump what was on their mind. Little Nicole asked him to be kind and to always tell the truth, and not to incite violence between people of color. Another little girl asked him to allow people of different races to be friends. A little boy asked him not to say that people who do not have white skin are all robbers. Another little girl said simply that she hoped he did not start a war, and another asked that he not send them back to Mexico. Keating posted the letters on Facebook for everyone to see. She was proud of her students because they asked for things that were necessary for them, in a respectful way.
Anthony Scaramucci, the creator of hedge-fund Skybridge Capital and one of Trump’s top advisors, says Americans should take President-elect Trump at his word. He believes he will build a wall – if he says he will. When New York Magazine asked him how it would be possible to have Mexico pay for the wall, he responded, that the U.S. could charge an excise tax on goods coming into the country from Mexico. However, he also said the American people did the right thing by electing Trump. The interviewer corrected him, stating that American’s voted for Clinton, not Trump. Scaramucci replied he did not see that way.
If President-elect Trump wants to build a wall, he will have to convince Congress using a cost-efficient plan. The Affordable Care Act has provided millions of people with health insurance, at an affordable premium. The average cost of health insurance within the marketplace, after the 110 percent rise, will be $78 a month. The newly elected president-elect has changed his mind on repealing the health coverage. He states that he is willing to keep the Affordable Care Act and instead, make the needed changes. Therefore, it is entirely possible, Trump will not deliver on some of his campaign promises.

20165,20165,Sinister Siblings From ‘The Great Comet’ Go to Fashion Week - The New York Times,Jacob Bernstein,"In “Natasha, Pierre  the Great Comet of 1812,” a rock opera on Broadway adapted from a section of Leo Tolstoy’s “War and Peace,” Amber Gray and Lucas Steele play Hélène and Anatole Kuragin, a pair of   aristocratic siblings who are impervious to consequence and impossibly chic in their punk romantic  . In other words, they were perfect casting for New York Fashion Week  —  presuming they could get seats to a show. A reporter’s initial plan was to take them to Raf Simons’s debut at Calvin Klein, but with just 400 seats in the house and no   Calvin Klein available for them to wear, the request was declined. They almost didn’t get into Tory Burch either, until Ms. Burch and her team agreed to dress Ms. Gray and seat her with Mr. Steele in the front row at her show Tuesday morning, which took place at the Whitney Museum in Lower Manhattan. (The company doesn’t have a men’s line and therefore couldn’t outfit Mr. Steele). Had so few people in the fashion industry read the rapturous reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Hollywood Reporter? Or could it be the source material? If it was the latter, Ms. Gray could hardly blame them. She hadn’t read the classic novel when she and Mr. Steele debuted as the scheming siblings in in its first Off Broadway production in 2012. “When I first picked the book up, I cheated and just read the   section the show is based on,” Ms. Gray said, upon arriving at the Whitney in a burgundy leather jacket from AllSaints, along with a smart looking Tory Burch   guipure lace Carolina dress and ’  ankle boots from Ms. Burch. Mr. Steele wore his own vintage black leather jacket, with a borrowed burgundy and black   shirt, borrowed black slacks and borrowed black and red loafers from AllSaints. Behind them was a stylist named Michael Fusco. “He’s here to make sure we don’t look like morons,” Mr. Steele said with a glance, as Mr. Fusco adjusted his jacket collar. On their way into the museum, they ran into the veteran magazine editor and critic Hal Rubenstein, whom Mr. Steele had met over the summer at a charity gala. “I was at your benefit,” Mr. Steele said. “I saw your show,” Mr. Rubenstein said. “It was a wonderful evening. ” A few minutes later, a nervous Mr. Steele and Ms. Gray were introduced to Anna Wintour, who had seen it, too. “I saw it! I loved it,” Ms. Wintour said, going on to marvel at how gloriously “awful” their characters managed to be. In their   seats, the duo chatted about what it has been like to take part in a show that started small before settling at the Imperial Theater in Times Square. Both actors said they struggled for years before being cast in an early production of “The Great Comet” in 2012. Ms. Gray, who is 35 and lives in   Brooklyn, with her boyfriend and young son, worked over the years for the jewelry company Dinosaur Designs. Mr. Steele, who lives in Harlem and is unmarried, did everything from being a nanny to manning sample sales. (Although he is in his 30s, he asked that his age not be printed). Given the quirky format of the show, neither saw its ultimate commercial viability as  . The 2012 production took place in a faux supper club, broke the fourth wall and featured   dance numbers and progressive casting choices, which is how Ms. Gray (who is black) and Mr. Steele (who is white) ended up playing biological siblings. The audience often got inebriated and unruly, Ms. Gray said. ”There was a little groping of the ladies,” she said. “And there was the famous incident when someone threw a cellphone,” Mr. Steele said, referring to the time in 2013 when Kevin Williamson, a writer from National Review, earned plaudits among the cast for taking the device of a texting seatmate and hurling it into the distance. Yet here they were five years later, being photographed by the fashion paparazzi, still not exactly famous but not anonymous either. Around 9:30 a. m. the muslin came up and the models began their march. Roxy Music blared and Ms. Gray joked with Mr. Steele, who noted the similarities to the opulence of the models and their characters in “The Great Comet. ” “They’re all Kuragins,” she said. Like all fashion shows, it was considerably shorter than a Russian novel. Ten minutes later, the pair headed over to meet Ms. Burch, who was holding court in a corner with a gaggle of editors. “Thank you so much for coming,” Ms. Burch said, before apologizing for not having yet been to see them on Broadway. The three posed for pictures, and then Ms. Gray and Mr. Steele exited onto the street and walked over to the nearby Standard Hotel for avocado toast. “There’s no dairy in it, right?” Mr. Steele asked the waiter. Although “The Great Comet” has been on Broadway just two months, Ms. Gray and Mr. Steele have each performed it more than 400 times in its various incarnations. Both said that next fall might be a good time for them to leave. Mr. Steele has had surgery and extensive physical therapy that he attributes to all the   he does in the show. It also gets exhausting, he said, playing one of those people who “peaked in high school. ” Ms. Gray seemed more upbeat. Before departing the restaurant shortly before 11 a. m. she recalled some advice she got early in her career: “If you stand in line long enough, you will get served. ”",0

20167,20167,Voters in Thailand Endorse Military’s Proposed Constitution - The New York Times,Richard C. Paddock,"BANGKOK  —   In its first test at the polls, Thailand’s military government won overwhelming approval Sunday of a new Constitution that aims to reduce the power of political parties and extend the influence of the military. With 94 percent of the ballots counted, voters were approving the military’s proposed Constitution by a wide margin, according to returns issued by the election commission. A companion ballot measure that would give the military junta the authority to fill the Senate with its appointees was also easily winning approval. The gap was wide enough that the results would not change, Somchai Srisutthiyakorn, an election official, said on television. Meechai Ruchupan, the chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, said his panel would begin writing laws required to put the new Constitution into effect as soon as the results were official. “Our country has been wounded for a long time,” he said. “From now on, everyone in the country will join hands and move the country forward under the new rules that we approved. ” The Constitution would be the country’s 20th in 84 years. Election officials put the turnout at 54. 6 percent of eligible voters. The junta seized power in 2014 and brought temporary peace after years of clashes between political factions. The military leaders have pledged to hold parliamentary elections next year and return power to civilian leaders no matter what the outcome of the voting on Sunday. Human rights groups challenged the legitimacy of the referendum because of restrictions that prevented opponents of the proposed Constitution from campaigning. The junta limited public assemblies and threatened long prison terms for people who spread information that it deemed false. More than 120 people were arrested for violating campaign rules in the weeks leading up to the referendum, according to Human Rights Watch. Thailand has long been divided between the rural poor, mainly in the northern and northeastern parts of the country, and the urban middle class, leading to years of protests and of clashes between the two factions. Two populist prime ministers, Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, were elected with the support of rural, northern voters. But Mr. Thaksin was ousted by a military coup in 2006, and Ms. Yingluck was ousted by a court ruling just before the 2014 coup. Opponents have long accused both siblings of being corrupt. Mr. Thaksin, who lives in   exile, was convicted in absentia in 2008 of violating    rules in a land deal. Ms. Yingluck is on trial on charges of criminal negligence in managing government rice subsidies for poor farmers. Adding to Thailand’s precarious political situation has been the lingering illness of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 88, who has been hospitalized for more than a year. Analysts say the military sees its role as ensuring stability as the country prepares for the expected succession of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn. Thailand has experienced a repeated cycle of elections, coups and new Constitutions since the absolute monarchy was abolished in 1932. The proposed Constitution was designed to shift the balance of power away from major political parties and give a greater voice to   parties under a new formula for awarding seats in Parliament. Experts say the system was designed so no single party would have control and so the country would be ruled by a coalition of political parties. “The politics from now will be more compromising, more negotiating,” Yuthaporn Issarachai, the dean of political science at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, said in a television interview. “It won’t be politics ruled by the majority. So we will expect to see some adjustments from the political parties. We may see the switching of sides and some negotiations. ” Approval of the second measure on the ballot would give the junta the power to appoint the 250 members of the Senate to   terms and give the senators a role in selecting the prime minister, which previously was left to the House of Representatives. “It will lead to a new political system that we’ve never seen before,” said Kamnoon Sittisamarn, a former senator and a member of the junta’s advisory National Reform Steering Assembly. “It was designed to make the country move forward for a change and not return to crisis. ” The biggest loser under the new system will most likely be Ms. Yingluck’s Pheu Thai party. Sodsri Satayathum, a former election commissioner, questioned how effective a coalition government could be. “In the upcoming election, there won’t be a single party that wins the majority,” she told reporters. “The government will find it hard to run the country. ” Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, a political science professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the election results were contrary to the push toward democracy in Western society. “This is a reflection of the mistrust of politicians,” she said. “It’s very  . ” In Bangkok, Sunee Nateethong, 50, a businesswoman, said she voted for the junta’s proposals because she favored a continuing role by the military to reduce corruption and maintain stability. “It is better than politicians running the country,” she said. “It’s good to have the military babysitting the government for the next five years. ” Sikarin Kanoksikarin, 44, who works for a United States food producer, said it was better for the country to have the military restore democracy gradually, as the new Constitution would. “To change the political system takes time,” he said. But people who voted against the junta’s proposals said they were dissatisfied with its management of the economy and were tired of the military taking power. “I don’t like dictatorship,” said Putiporn   21, an accountant. “This is our country’s cycle. We have an election and a coup over and over again. I think the previous Constitution was good. ” Paparat Yurod, 46, who comes from northeastern Thailand but works in a Bangkok laundry, said voters should be able to decide for themselves who runs the country, without military interference. “We are hoping to get democracy soon,” she said. “Even if we have a bad government, we will have another election and can decide if they continue in power. ”",0

20170,20170,SCOTUS Refuses to Hear Texas Voter ID Case -- For Now,Lana Shadwick,"The U. S. Supreme Court has declined to hear Texas’ appeal from an adverse ruling in the Texas voter ID case. [The Texas Attorney General said after the U. S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear the case, “While we are disappointed that the U. S. Supreme Court did not immediately take our case, Chief Justice Roberts made it very clear that the case will be an even stronger posture for Supreme Court review after further proceedings in lower courts. Texas enacted a common sense voter ID law to safeguard the integrity of our elections, and we will continue to fight for the law in the district court, the Fifth Circuit, and if necessary, the Supreme Court again. ”  Breitbart Texas reported the day before the U. S. Supreme Court’s order denying review of the case that a federal magistrate delayed the next hearing in the Texas voter ID case so that the Trump Administration would have time to discuss the case with the government’s lawyers. Federal lawyers filed a motion for continuance on Friday, January 20, asking the court to continue a hearing that had originally been set for January 24. In an effort to temporarily address the “discriminatory effects” of the law as originally written, the trial court enforced a remedy shortly before the 2016 Election that allowed voters without proper ID to sign affidavits attesting to the reason why they could not obtain one before casting a regular ballot. Harris County Clerk Stan Stanart, who runs Texas’ largest voting jurisdiction, told Breitbart on Sunday, “The flawed solution pushed by the DOJ that we were forced to use last November allowed hundreds of illegal votes to be cast in Harris County. ” The latest Supreme Court ruling sets the stage for the   lawsuit to continue down a track that could take many more months to resolve. The State of Texas is not without other options outside of the courtroom, however. Public Interest Legal Foundation President J. Christian Adams told Breitbart Texas that legislators can take the job of fixing the law into their own hands. “The Texas Legislature is also free to offer reforms that could serve to fix the ‘discriminatory effects’ of the law. A fix would be easy,” Adams noted. In July 2016, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that Texas’ voter ID law had a discriminatory effect under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act but said the district court erred in finding discriminatory intent, as reported by Breitbart Texas. The   en banc ruling held that the law did not constitute a poll tax, either. The appellate court remanded the case to the district court to determine if the voter ID provisions were written to be intentionally discriminatory. The dissents to the opinion encompassed 100 pages. Judge Edith Jones, a Reagan nominated judge, wrote a dissent which was joined by four others. She wrote, “Requiring a voter to verify her identity with a photo ID at the polling place is a reasonable requirement widely supported by Texans of all races and members of the public belonging to both political parties. ” Texas Governor Greg Abbott said immediately after the appellate court decision, “The 5th Circuit rightly reversed the lower court’s finding of discriminatory purpose, but wrongly concluded the law had a discriminatory effect. Voter fraud is real, and it undermines the integrity of the election process. ” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton responded to the Fifth Circuit’s ruling at the time, “It is imperative that the State government safeguards our elections and ensures the integrity of our democratic process. Preventing voter fraud is essential to accurately reflecting the will of Texas voters during elections, and it is unfortunate that this   law, providing protections against fraud, was not upheld in its entirety. ” The seven acceptable forms of photo ID under the law include the following: a Texas driver’s license free Texas election identification card (EIC) Texas personal identification card Texas license to carry a concealed handgun U. S. military identification card U. S. citizenship certificate and a U. S. passport. Lana Shadwick is a contributing writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.

20171,20171,O’Donnell: ’You Only Live Once’ -- The Man of Forlorn Hope,Patrick O'Donnell,"You might think the phrase “you only live once,” is a modern sentiment, but it was actually also the personal motto of one of the true unsung heroes of the American Revolution  —   Jack Steward. A tall, handsome, charismatic Maryland officer known for his sizable ego, Steward fought fearlessly in battle for a cause he ardently believed in  —   the United States. [In late August of 1776, the British Army landed more than twenty thousand troops on Long Island, where they planned to annihilate the Patriot forces. British General William Howe ordered a third of his Redcoats and Hessians to attack Washington’s troops head on, while the remainder circled around behind to trap the Americans.  The battle evolved exactly according to Howe’s plan, and within hours, he had trapped Washington and his men on the Heights of Gowanus in Brooklyn. The end seemed near for the young American army. To give hundreds of men in Washington’s army time to escape, the Marylanders mounted a series of suicidal bayonet charges against an old stone house occupied by British General Lord Cornwallis and his Redcoats. Flanked by thousands of British and Hessian troops, a few hundred men fought desperately and somehow bought enough time for the bulk of Washington’s men to withdraw. Washington, watching the action unfold through his spyglass, cried out “Good God! What brave fellows I must this day lose!” Many of the Marylanders involved in the charge sacrificed their lives. Most lie in a mass grave somewhere near the epic stand in Brooklyn. The exact whereabouts of the mass grave remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of the Revolution. But a handful of Marylanders survived. To stay alive, they would have to swim eighty yards across Gowanus Creek while under a hail of fire. Witnessing his brothers in danger, Lt. Steward jumped into action. He provided covering fire as the Marylanders swam for their lives. His valiant actions saved many of his Maryland brothers, who would eventually form the core of the regiment that Washington would call upon time and again in the inflection points of some of the greatest battles of the American Revolution. The story of Steward and the other Marylanders is captured in the   book Washington’s Immortals, recently released in paperback. This unique book is the first Band of Brothers treatment of the American Revolution, detailing the most important elements of nearly every significant battle of The War of Independence. Steward’s next bold stand arose at the Battle of Staten Island in August 1777, when the Americans mounted a raid against a British outpost. At first, the Patriots caught the British by surprise and quickly captured dozens of prisoners and large quantities of supplies. But the Redcoats regrouped and drove the Continental troops back to their boats. Steward led a desperate rear guard, holding off hundreds of British troops long enough for most of the raiding party to escape. When all the boats retreated from the island, the enemy surrounded Steward, forcing him to surrender. They placed him on one of the prison ships docked in New York Harbor. Often called “hell ships,” these vessels served as floating concentration camps where prisoners (as many as 15, 000 Americans) slowly starved or perished from disease in the cramped,   quarters. However, knowing he would “only live once,” the indomitable Steward miraculously escaped via a rowboat he purloined and rejoined Washington’s Army. By July 1779, the War of Independence had tediously dragged on for more than three years, and the Americans had survived a brutal winter at Valley Forge. After vigilantly gathering actionable intelligence on the British outpost at Stony Point, Washington ordered a raid to assault the fort and remove the threat the British fortification posed to American defenses in the Hudson Valley. Rather than deploy his entire army, which could have played into a British counterattack, Washington unleashed more than 1, 000 men from his light infantry, a corps “composed of the best, most hardy and active marksmen. ” The volunteer force, unencumbered by baggage and heavy artillery, earned renown for their daring, alertness, and efficiency. Jack Steward commanded a unit within the light infantry. Steward, now a major, first rode out with the commander of the raid Brigadier General “Mad Anthony” Wayne to spy out the lay of the land and take a closer look at the Stony Point’s defenses. Wayne realized that to have any chance of success he would need a “forlorn hope,” in today’s parlance, a suicide squad. Their mission was to cut through the thick abatis while under fire from the heavily defended fort. The sharpened logs  —   the eighteenth century equivalent of barbed wire  —   and multiple cannon made the fort nearly impregnable. Steward volunteered to lead the forlorn hope and the advance guard, the first to pierce the Point’s defenses. He encouraged men to join him, saying, “I want no men but the best, those that are willing to face death for their country. ” Steward’s advance guard consisted entirely of volunteers, “desperadoes led by officers of distinguished merit. ” The most fervent Patriots volunteered to be part of the forlorn hope, which they considered an immensely honorable post. Steward garnered so many volunteers that the men had to draw lots to determine who would join. Under the cover of darkness, Steward and his forlorn hope stealthily approached the fort. To preserve the element of surprise, General “Mad Anthony” Wayne ordered, “Should there be any soldier so lost to every feeling of honor, as to attempt to retreat one single foot or skulk in the face of danger, the officer next to him is immediately to put him to death. ” The same fate would befall any man who spoke or discharged his musket. The officers carried spontoons  —   long, menacing,   iron pikes on the end of wooden poles  —   which would be used without hesitation to fulfill General Wayne’s order should the need arise (Wayne didn’t provision “safe spaces” for the light infantry). And the need did arise  —   at least one man who attempted to flee was run through by an American officer. Once on the abatis, Steward’s men began hacking away. Within seconds, a British sentry sounded the alarm, and drummers beat the call to arms. As the axes cut a small opening in the British defenses, musket balls and grape shot from cannon tore into Steward’s men. However, the forlorn hope persisted, eventually cutting a hole wide enough for the rest of the American light infantry to infiltrate. But the forlorn hope was not finished. Steward’s men had to penetrate the second abatis, with the British now fully alert and firing their cannons and muskets. Men fell, cut down by the deadly fire, but the axes finally succeeded in breaching the defenses. Steward and his advance guard poured through the opening, leading the assault on the fort. The Americans won the day, achieving a crucial victory that boosted morale among the Patriots. General Wayne reported the victory to Washington, noting, “Our officers and men behaved like men who are determined to be free. ” For his daring actions at Stony Point, Jack Steward received a Congressional Silver Medal, a precursor to the Medal of Honor  —   one of only about a dozen medals awarded during the Revolution. Steward, promoted to colonel, would go on to fight in many more critical battles of the Revolution in the South.   for his day, he petitioned to lead a regiment of African Americans, but the idea never got off the ground. The Man of Forlorn Hope survived countless battles and witnessed the Yorktown surrender of Cornwallis  —   the very general that killed so many of his Maryland brothers at the stone house in Brooklyn. The war nearly over, Steward was riding on the outskirts of Charleston, to George Washington’s nephew, William Washington’s wedding party when his horse fell. “And the Colonel pitching on his head in a ditch, dislocated his neck. He lived till Sunday morning about seven o’clock and then died. ” Maryland’s indestructible man, who had survived the Battle of Brooklyn, escaped a prison ship, led the forlorn hope at Stony Point, and fought in many battles in South, including Yorktown, died 234 years ago this week. The officers of the Maryland Line, Steward’s friends, gathered to mourn. The next day, they interred Steward with every military honor. “This gentlemen, whose untimely death is much to be lamented, had served with great reputation during the war, and was much beloved by the army. ” He only lived once, but made the most of that life, dedicating it to the cause of American freedom. Patrick K. O’Donnell is a bestselling, critically acclaimed military historian and an expert on elite units. He is the author of ten books. Washington’s Immortals is his newest, which has just been released as a soft cover and has been named one of the 100 Best American Revolution Books of All Time by the Journal of the American Revolution.

20172,20172,Carter Reveals Upgrades To US Long Range Rocket,Alex Ansary,"Carter Reveals Upgrades To US Long Range Rocket 11/02/2016 
SPUTNIK NEWS 
On Tuesday US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced that the Army’s tactical missile system (ATACMS) will be upgraded to strike both land and sea targets. Such technology will go a long way to defending allies against the Chinese menace and battling Moscow’s “aggression” in the Baltics. 
The missile system is sponsored by an office created by Carter in 2012, the Strategic Capabilities Office, which is currently being lead by Will Roper, a protege’ of the Secretary’s. During a panel at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) on Friday Roper told an audience, “How you offset the adversaries trying to offset your offset? It’s very simple to do that, you just don’t talk about your best capabilities…We are keeping our best ideas behind the door and probably always will,” according to Breaking Defense. 
After the panel, he continued, “We thought it was important to come out (in public) with ATACMS for the Army because there’s been a lot of writing, a lot of speeches, on the need for the Army to go cross-domain.” High ranking officials in the US military have been calling for the ATACMS to extend its capabilities seaward for some time, and Roper responded to these concerns saying, “it’s time for us to show it isn’t just a theoretical idea, it’s something we can potentially get to quickly with something that we already have.” 
During a morning session at CSIS Carter spoke of the new innovative features of the ATACMS, and how the SCO tries to maximize the potential of existing systems. 
“A prominent theme of SCO’s work is spearheading creative and unexpected new ways to use our existing missiles and advanced munitions, and across varied domains”, he said, adding, “… By integrating an existing seeker onto the front of the missile, they’re enabling it to hit moving targets, both at sea as well as on land. With this capability, what was previously an Army surface-to-surface missile system can project power from coastal locations up to 300 kilometers into the maritime domain.” 
Carter detailed the SCO’s plans to utilize seeker technology that the Defense Department has already developed so the missile system can hit targets both on sea and land. 
Lockheed Martin was awarded the $174 million contract for the long range artillery rocket system in May 2015. Ken Musculus, vice president of tactical missiles at the defense contractor said at the time that ATACMS is “reliable and proven in combat, which is why it continues to be our customers’ choice for long-range strike requirements.”",1
20173,20173,"Mosul will not be taken, ISIS will not be destroyed",nan,"Mosul will not be taken, ISIS will not be destroyed 27.10.2016 In June of 2014, the world was amazed to see the Iraq army - armed and trained by the Americans - losing ground to the Islamic State. Fallujah, Ramadi and Iraq's second largest city, Mosul , fell within a month. The operation to liberate Mosul was launched on October 16. Will the city be liberated from ISIS terrorists?In 2014, the whole world started talking about the emergence of new terrorists . The world could not destroy them as the Americans wanted to use the new terrorists to their advantage to struggle against geopolitical rivals - Iran and Russia. Now we can see the Americans trying to take Mosul. The Western press is full of rosy expectations about the imminent collapse of the Islamic State"" (a terrorist organization banned in Russia). Fallujah and Ramadi have been liberated - one only has to take the two-million-strong Mosul, and the trick is done. Yet, the trick does not seem to be that simple. Firstly, Mosul is a city with a Sunni population in the Shiite-ruled country. This is the first resistance factor. Secondly, Mosul is the actual capital of the Islamic State - this is a city, the status of which determines the status of the Islamists. Therefore, there will be fierce battles, a humanitarian catastrophe and up to one million refugees. This is where Russia will be able to draw a parallel with Aleppo - something the Americans will not like. In pictures: The storm of Mosul, Iraq Nevertheless, if we do not see all that, and 9,000 ISIS fighters will leave Mosul, it will mean that they have been affiliated with Turkey and the United States. It is not hard to guess where the Turks and the Americans will send them to - to Syria: Deir ez-Zor, Palmyra, Damascus. Will there be US flag draped coffins coming from Iraq? The city is being stormed by motley and, one might even say, hostile forces . No one knows how they may fight for power during the operation. An Iraqi anonymous observer in Baghdad said that ""the offensive on Mosul looks hopeless, but one pins all their hopes on the support from the US, The Independent wrote. At least 12 US generals and 5,000 American troops are in Iraq, and they will play a crucial role in the fight. Five thousand is a lot, but what if the Americans start suffering losses? ""The Iraqis say that Mosul is their center. The Kurds say that the city is their center,"" Semyon Bagdasarov, an expert on Central Asia and the Middle East at the Center for Analytical Research told Pravda.Ru. Peshmerga (the Kurdish militia - ed.) is the core strength: five thousand Kurds are attacking Mosul, and what they will take will be their territory. The Kurdistan Workers' Party is also involved, and they are not going to share with anyone. All these are hostile parties, including the Turkish army and the Sunni militia. In general, it is total chaos."" According to Colonel Tim Collins, a former officer in the British Army, who fought in Iraq in 2003, currently the chief of the security service at New Century, the conflict may exacerbate further against the background of the conflict between the Turks and the Kurds. The Iranians would like to see this problem by increasing their influence on Iraq. The Syrians want to punish the Sunnis, the Iraqi army wants to restore its reputation, the colonel said in an interview with CNN. General Qasem Soleimani of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards could be one of the winners, Collins believes. Whoever becomes the victor in Mosul, the Islamic State will not be defeated , even if ISIS loses Mosul. The organization will recover in Libya, Afghanistan, Indonesia, the Philippines and elsewhere - whenever Washington needs those terrorists. They will not stop recruiting new members across the globe, because the Americans continue spreading their ideology to the Islamic world. Will Europe rebel against Washington, or will it continue to suffer from refugees and Jihadists? Lyuba Lulko Read article on the Russian version of Pravda.Ru Russia to save Iraq from ISIS",1

20175,20175,"A $1,000 Day in Tokyo for $100 - The New York Times",Lucas Peterson,"I walked out of Tokyo Station, the big commuter hub in the city’s Chiyoda district, and turned to look up at its gorgeous brick facade. I was lost. I couldn’t find the Tokyo Station Hotel  —   a   luxury property that was renovated in 2012. My mistake, it turned out, was leaving the train station at all. The hotel and the train station coexist in one long, outstretched building, which was completed in 1914 and offers a refreshing prewar architectural counterpoint to the glittering    skyscrapers Tokyo is now known for. I looped back in and found the hotel’s lobby, as well as its chief concierge, Marie Antoinette Mori, who greeted me at her desk. Originally from the Philippines, Ms. Mori became fascinated with Japan during its big 1980s economic boom. She studied international tourism in Japan, married a Japanese man and began working in the hospitality industry, where her career took off. “I became one of the favorites of Mr. Stringer”  —   the former Sony chairman Howard Stringer. “I was the only one who wasn’t afraid of him,” she said with a laugh. Ms. Mori had prepared an itinerary for a fictitious guest, spending $1, 000 (about 110, 000 yen) over the course of a day in this   city. My goal was to remake the itinerary on a budget of $100  —   necessarily cutting a few corners, but hoping to retain the spirit of the original. HIGH Ms. Mori escorted me to the top floor of her hotel, into a huge room where sunlight flooded in through large skylights. Guests grazed on a large, comprehensive morning buffet. Ms. Mori recommended the Tokyo Station Hotel breakfast (3, 800 yen) where they could enjoy standard Western fare (eggs made to order, coffee, pastries) or regional Japanese staples, where the Tokyo Station really excels:   (hot pot from the northern Hokkaido region) traditional rice porridge, soybean milk skin, and boiled rape blossoms. Ms. Mori said many luxury hotels in the area had comparable buffets. The   she said, specializes in pastries. “Over there they have a, uh   …     what do you call it?” she asked. “A Cronut. ” LOW From one buffet in a huge train station to another, I went to the considerably cheaper Bar Marche Kodama in the Shinagawa train station in the Minato ward. It’s also a little tricky to find: Don’t exit the station once you get off at the Shinagawa stop. Go into the Ecute department store and you’ll find the small restaurant in the back corner. Once there, I feasted on an eclectic, mostly   buffet of prosciutto, green salad, fresh corn, pasta Bolognese, crispy fried rice and, for dessert, Italian wedding cookies. The inclusion of the salad was particularly nice  —   Japanese cuisine is healthy, but not necessarily heavy on raw, leafy greens. Total cost: 620 yen. HIGH Ms. Mori quoted a price of roughly 15, 000 yen to have a private sedan with a driver for three hours to ferry our faux   around the city. The Tokyo Station Hotel goes so far as to meet guests at train platforms and escort them to the hotel  —   a service that comes only with staying at the hotel, of course, which can run over $1, 000 per night. LOW Logistics are tricky for those unfamiliar with the city. Get to know and love the train, because you’ll be spending quite a bit of time with it. Tokyo’s system is expansive and can be, in a word, daunting. There are over 100 different railway lines in Tokyo, and most of them are privately held by competing companies. The two big ones you’ll need to know are JR East, the largest railway system in Japan, and the Tokyo Metro, the city’s busiest subway system. If you’re planning to use only the subway or JR lines, there are passes for that. A combination ticket, though (which can be purchased in JR stations) is the better way to go. For 1, 590 yen, you’ll be able to use several lines for one day, including all of Tokyo’s JR lines and the Tokyo Metro. Another option is to buy a Suica or Pasmo card (available at ticket vending machines in major train stations) reusable cards on which you load money you touch them to the turnstile each time you ride. There is a   deposit to pick up one of those cards, but it’s worth it  —   you won’t have to deal with individual tickets, you’ll get a small discount on rides and you can even use it to make purchases in some stores and at the city’s ubiquitous vending machines. Related pro tip Get a SIM card for your phone  —   data only. You won’t want to be without a maps app when you’re walking around. Cards in the $15 to $20 range are widely available. (Make sure you get the right size: the   iPhones, for example, use nano SIM cards, not micro SIM.) HIGH The Asakusa neighborhood is known for its Sensoji Buddhist temple, Tokyo’s oldest. Ms. Mori recommended a rickshaw tour of the neighborhood, passing along Sumida Park, one of the many places in Tokyo to see sakura, or cherry blossoms, in the early spring. A   tour costs 16, 250 yen. LOW I set out to do some exploring on my own, and see some sakura in the process. A follower of the Frugal Traveler Twitter account recommended the Nezu Museum in the Minato district. While the Nezu’s collection of Buddhist art and Chinese bronzes was interesting, I was most impressed with the lush garden out back. The garden  —   about four acres  —   is shockingly big in a place where space is so precious. It truly feels like an escape from the city. Admission was 1, 000 yen. From there, I hopped a couple of trains over to the Korakuen station and walked up to the University of Tokyo’s Koishikawa Botanical Gardens. After paying admission (400 yen) I headed from the southeast entrance to a huge open expanse in the center of the garden. I found families picnicking, children playing and people lining up for coffee and tea from the ramshackle snack bar called Coffee Time (a coffee is 300 yen). All were enjoying the budding cherry blossoms and cool spring weather. HIGH Ms. Mori recommended the omakase tasting menu at  —   where else?  —   Sukiyabashi Jiro. The    sushi master Jiro Ono’s already formidable status was made outright legendary with the release of the 2012 documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi. ” The   restaurant is difficult to get into, but Ms. Mori can make the arrangements. “We can get you into Jiro,” she said, “but then you have to go. You have to. We can’t have   at Jiro. ” The price for lunch (or dinner) is 30, 000 yen. LOW Jiro received three Michelin stars Tsuta received one. It was the first Japanese ramen shop ever to receive such an honor. The small, unassuming space, close to the Sugamo station on the JR Yamanote line, is difficult to get into for different reasons: They take no reservations and operate on a ticket system. I went early one morning, around 7:30 a. m. and waited outside the restaurant with a handful of other people. Eventually the door slid open and a man came out with a handful of small, laminated tickets. He handed me one: “Come back,” he said. “Between 12 and 1 p. m. ” He took a   bill as a deposit, then went back inside and closed the door. When I returned at noon, I was treated to the best bowl of shoyu (soy  ) ramen I’d ever eaten. The broth was deep, intense and slightly sweet. The accompaniments  —     egg, bamboo shoots and pork slices  —   were done perfectly. The basic ramen bowl at Tsuta is 950 yen  —   I paid a total of 1, 250 for three extra slices of pork. HIGH Who doesn’t like a little costume play built into their vacations? Ms. Mori recommended something called a “kimono experience and photo shoot,” wherein the patron pays for elaborate kimono dress (in one of several styles: oiran, maiko or geisha) as well as hair and makeup. A photo shoot follows. Men, don’t think you’re getting out of this: There’s a samurai option for you. The oiran set with two kimonos costs 27, 000 yen. LOW I found a different way to incorporate both ceremonial clothing (of sorts) and culture into my visit: taking in a Japanese baseball game. I bought my ticket at one of the many   in Japan. (  is owned by a Japanese company.) It was a complicated process, one that involved a helpful clerk trying to spell my name in the Japanese alphabet  —   buying at the stadium probably would have been easier. It also involved deciding what “cheering section” I wanted to sit in. I decided on an outfield ticket on the side of the home team, the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. The game was positively raucous  —   at one point, everyone in my section produced tiny umbrellas and began thrusting them up and down and chanting (a   chant, I assumed) while a small brass band backed them up. The stadium grub selection was great, too  —   a big bowl of ramen could be had for 750 yen, yakitori for 100 yen, and a whiskey and melon soda for 600 yen. My ticket cost a reasonable 1, 800 yen. HIGH Seiji Yamamoto is the chef at Nihonryori RyuGin, a modern kaiseki restaurant that was awarded three Michelin stars. Mr. Yamamoto is known for incorporating modern culinary techniques with the refined, traditional kaiseki dinner. The descriptions of RyuGin’s courses are wonderfully abstract: Dishes have names like “Coolness Warmth Playfulness Nostalgia and Temptation” and “A Message From the Coast of Japan. ” Dinner costs 27, 000 yen. LOW I was also in search of a taste of the coast of Japan, in the form of a sushi dinner. I met up with my friend Mayumi, a Tokyo native, and presented her with my annoyingly specific parameters: something good but not that good cheap but definitely not poor quality. She   took me to a small place near the Kyodo train station in her neighborhood, about a   ride from Shinjuku: Midori Sushi, an unpretentious restaurant next to a KFC. The chef Ken Hosono’s   omakase menu featured an exceptionally   squid, along with barracuda, fatty tuna, uni and a wonderfully buttery scallop, among other pieces. The cost was 3, 000 yen per person. Not only was it one of best sushi dinners I’ve had in recent memory, but it was among the cheapest  —   a    sweet spot that every frugal traveler seeks out.",0
20176,20176,Chicago Cubs Crowned the Lords of Windy City,Jomo Merritt,"It has been 25 years since a record turnout of people watched the World Series on television. Nobody saw this win coming, and it was 108 years in the making. However, dreams came true on Tuesday, Nov. 2, 2016, when the Chicago Cubs, crowned the Lords of Windy City, won the World Series.
The city of Chicago experienced an epic moment in sports history. A moment, so grand that it would topple the elections for a split second. After the game, crowds went ballistic. Things were just getting warmed up as two million fans relished in the Cubs victory lap around the city. The triumphant tour ended with a rally in Grant Park. However, the lap may have concluded but the Chicago Cubs long awaited success story has yet to be told.
The Road to Victory
Success did not come overnight. In fact, it started years ago. Before they were the Lords of Windy City, the Cubs played in 11 World Series, overall. Moreover, before they were the Chicago Cubs, they were the Chicago White Stockings, in 1876. West Side Grounds was where the White Stockings did their damage, with multiple victories. Eventually, establishing themselves as one of the new league’s highest-regarded teams.
By 1890, they had converted to the Chicago Colts. Nevertheless, they would not remain the Colts for long. Despite the fact, the franchise had ushered in a new dynasty, a name change was underway for the final time. In 1902, they became the Chicago Cubs.
The Cubs won four emblems. in a five-year span. from 1905 to 1912. During that time, they won two World Series titles. The Cubs recorded a record 116 victories and the best-winning percentage (.763) in Major League history. However, it would all fall apart due to the alleged Billy Goat curse.
Curse of the Billy Goat
In 1945, a man named William Sianis, owner of Billy Goat Tavern, supposedly placed “The Curse of the Billy Goat” on the Chicago Cubs. This sports-related curse lasted from 1945 to 2016. The legend began over the odor of his pet goat, Murphy. The myth states that Murphy’s scent was annoying fans. During game four, he was asked to leave Wrigley Field, the 1945 World Series. Livid, Sianis apparently professed, “They ain’t gonna win no more, those Cubs,” which has been understood as an indication the Cubs would not win another World Series or the National League (NL) pennant.
Sianis stormed out of the stadium with his goat, and the Cubs lost the 1945 World Series to the Detroit Tigers. Never again, would they see a win, until the 2016 World Series Championship.
The Chicago Cubs Drought
Before their historic win, the Cubs had to endure almost a century of losses. In 1908, the Chicago Cubs won their last World Series, for the second successive year, against the Detroit Tigers. Even though the Cubs went on to play in seven World Series afterward, they went home with nothing. Instead of wins, there was only the agony of defeat. Nevertheless, this torment turned into the thrill of victory after winning the 2016 World Series, and the 2016 National League Championship Series.
The night of Nov. 2, concluded the 108-year World Series championship drought, plus a 71-year National League pennant drought that plagued the Chicago Cubs for over a century. This time period of losses would go down in history as one of the longest by any major American sports team.
The Victorious Night
All it took was an 8-7, 10-inning triumph over the Cleveland Indians, in an electrifying Game 7, that started Wednesday evening (Nov. 2) and finished promptly, on Thursday before noon (Nov. 3). It was a night to be remembered; every seat at Wrigley Field filled. The stadium, recognized for its ivy-coated brick outfield wall, unusual wind patterns from Lake Michigan, and the iconic red pavilion was the center of the universe that night.
Stars like John Travolta and Amy Schumer were at the event. Homeland Security, 1,000 Chicago police officers, and FBI agents swarmed the place. It was more than a big deal. The Chicago Cubs went out with a bang, ending the season with a 103–58 (.640) record. It would be their first 100-win season since 1935 (100–54, .649) and their best since 1910 (104–50, .675). Additionally, it is the sixth 100-victory season in franchise history.
When it was all over, the Cubs won the World Series for the first time since 1908, terminating the infamous 108-year win deficiency and the “curse,” thus, being crowned the Lords of Windy City.

20177,20177,C.D.C. Reports 234 Pregnant Women in U.S. With Zika - The New York Times,Sabrina Tavernise,"WASHINGTON  —   The number of women infected with the Zika virus during their pregnancies in the continental United States has risen to 234, health officials said on Thursday. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declined to say how many of the women had given birth, citing confidentiality concerns for the women and their families. But they did cite six cases with abnormalities  —   three babies with birth defects and another three who died before birth with evidence of defects. The numbers raised more questions than answers. Without knowing the total number of births, officials cannot know if the babies with birth defects represent a tiny fraction of the total, or a large part. The agency said some of the defects were related to microcephaly, a condition linked to Zika that causes brain damage and abnormally small heads. Others, like eye problems, were   but not caused by microcephaly. Dr. Denise J. Jamieson, one of the leaders of the pregnancy and birth defects team, which is part of the C. D. C. ’s Zika response effort, said the release of the numbers was the first in what will be weekly updates on birth outcomes in Zika pregnancies. As the number of births rises, she said, the agency will be able to release more detailed information. “We’re sort of in a hard place,” Dr. Jamieson said. “We can’t provide a lot of information about where these women are in their pregnancy. We don’t want to inadvertently disclose information about difficult decisions these women are making about their pregnancies. ” She said the numbers included the nine pregnant women the C. D. C. had reported on in February. Of the babies in those cases, at least one was born with microcephaly. The C. D. C. also reported on Thursday that the total number of pregnant women who had been infected with Zika in United States territories, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, was 189. But the agency did not report birth outcomes for that group. “Microcephalic babies are beginning to be born,” Dr. Jamieson said. “The disease seems to be very similar no matter where it is. ” Dr. Jamieson said some of the microcephalic births they were seeing were among women who had no symptoms of Zika, a troubling pattern. Roughly 80 percent of people who contract the virus never display symptoms. She estimated that the approximate risk of having a baby with birth defects  —   based on findings from Brazil, Colombia and other countries, including the United States  —   was between 1 percent and 15 percent. A study published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine found no cases of microcephaly among infants born to women in Colombia who were infected in the third trimester of pregnancy. “The pattern we are seeing in other places is the same as in U. S. travelers  —   that Zika is causing birth defects is real,” she said. “It’s not confined to one location or one time period. ”",0
20178,20178,2:00PM Water Cooler 11/1/2016,Lambert Strether,"By Lambert Strether of Corrente . 
TTP, TTIP, TISA 
CETA: “The provisional application of CETA refers to the fact that some things—like the tariff reductions—will come into operation immediately, assuming the European Parliament agrees. But other areas, notably the ISDS/ICS, must wait for full ratification of the deal. That requires all of the EU’s 28 member states to go through national ratification processes, which will probably take several years” [ Ars Technica ]. “And despite what the commission would have you think, it is by no means certain that all the national parliaments will approve CETA.” More: 
For example, a tweet by Katharina Nocun pointed out that left-wing and green parties could block its passage in Germany. At various times, there have been hints that other countries’ parliaments may not agree to the deal, but it’s not yet clear what the current situation is around the EU….. 
Another serious threat to CETA’s coming into force are legal challenges. As part of the deal to obtain Wallonia’s permission to sign CETA, the EU agreed that the ICS framework would be examined by the EU’s highest court, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). If the CJEU finds that the approach is incompatible with the EU’s fundamental principles, it will either have to be dropped from CETA (and TTIP ), or CETA itself will fall (as will TTIP). 
In addition, there are two constitutional challenges to CETA, one in Canada , and one in Germany. 
Good wrap-up of the state of play. 
TTIP: ” A much-debated trade deal between the European Union and the United States is not dead and negotiations will continue with the new U.S. administration after November’s elections, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on Saturday” [ Reuters ]. TTIP dresses up for Halloween. As a zombie! 
TPP: “[new Zealand] Prime Minister John Key believes the TPP still has a 50-50 chance of being passed in the lame-duck Congressional period after the November 8 presidential election” [ Otago Daily Times ]. 
TPP: “TPP Is Exciting. Let’s Make the Case for It” [Tyler Cown, Bloomberg ]. “So what then is the exciting, big-picture case for TPP? I say it’s to keep North America, and especially the U.S., the world’s leading economic cluster for the foreseeable future.” It’s a cluster, alright. 
TPP: “Only 38 per cent of Japanese want to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, according to a survey published by the newspaper Nikkei, showing a growing public distrust of free trade agreements” [ The Advertiser ]. “The government of Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has proposed to ratify the TPP before the end of the current parliamentary session, on November 30, in order to ensure that Japan is the first country to give its assent to the agreement.” 
2016 
Days until: 6. That’s less than a week! 
Corruption 
“If there is any lesson to be learned from the ghosts of Watergate, it is that the big-money support of a leader who has lost the ability to deliver the goods crumbles very quickly as the endgame unfolds” [ Of Two Minds ]. 
Downballot 
“Democrats are poised to gain seats in the House of Representatives this year, but with well over a dozen competitive races still viewed as tossups just one week before Election Day, the extent of that gain — and whether Republicans can stem the bleeding and keep a strong grip on their majority — remains uncertain” [ RealClearPolitics ]. “GOP insiders say their polling in swing districts has stabilized, and they feel energized by the news Friday that the FBI is looking into emails that could be related to its previously close investigation of Hillary Clinton’s private server.” 
“Hillary Clinton’s campaign has nearly taken up residence in North Carolina, strategically eyeing what it calls the “Checkmate State” as a way to soundly block Donald Trump’s path to the presidency” [ RealClearPolitics ]. As we wrote yesterday . 
The Trail 
I expected the Clinton campaign to have pulled up its dump truck and unloaded some serious oppo Monday or today; but so far as I can tell, all we have are damp squibs (1) and (2). Clearing the way for Wikileaks on Wednesday? 
(1) “Why Trump’s Russian server connection is less suspicious than it sounds” [ Engadget ]; Franklin Foer’s original piece of crap piece here, in the Jeff Bezos Shopper’s lifestyle insert (I’m not dignifying it with square brackets because the reaction by tech twitter is universally derisive). 
(2) “Donald Trump Used Legally Dubious Method to Avoid Paying Taxes” [ New York Times ]. “Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump’s tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time.” I’ve helpfully underlined the weasel phrase. 
Democrat Email Hairball 
“Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, last year signed a $7,000-a-month contract with the foundation of a major Clinton donor who made a fortune selling a type of mortgage that some critics say contributed to the housing collapse, hacked emails show” [ Politico ]. How cozy! 
” Forget the FBI cache; the Podesta emails show how America is run” [Thomas Frank, Guardian ]. 
[T]he emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by WikiLeaks from the hacked account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta. They are last week’s scandal in a year running over with scandals, but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal: they are a window into the soul of the Democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers. 
The class to which I refer is not rising in angry protest; they are by and large pretty satisfied, pretty contented. Nobody takes road trips to exotic West Virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live; on the contrary, they are the ones for whom such stories are written. This bunch doesn’t have to make do with a comb-over TV mountebank for a leader; for this class, the choices are always pretty good, and this year they happen to be excellent. 
They are the comfortable and well-educated mainstay of our modern Democratic party. They are also the grandees of our national media; the architects of our software; the designers of our streets; the high officials of our banking system; the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine-tune the Middle East with precision droning. They are, they think, not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones, the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves. 
The good people. 
Stats Watch 
Purchasing Managers’ Manufacturing Index, October 2016: “A marked upturn in new orders leads a very positive manufacturing PMI” [ Econoday ]. “The increase in orders is centered in domestic demand though export orders also improved. Backlogs are another plus, rising to the best level in three months…. Based on this report, the manufacturing sector, after a flat year, is now accelerating into year end.” But: “There is nothing in the ISM or Markit reports that would leave one to think manufacturing is on the mend” [ Econintersect ]. 
Institute For Supply Management Manufacturing Index, October 2016: “ISM’s manufacturing sample reported no better than moderate conditions [below consensus]. But new orders are a disappointment, still showing monthly growth but at a much slower rate” [ Econoday ]. “The construction sector, despite unusually low mortgage rates, has been struggling this year with the softness in single-family housing posing continued challenges for what is otherwise a strong new home market.” And: ” ISM employment index is not useful in understanding manufacturing jobs growth. The ISM employment index appears useful in predicting turning points which can lead the BLS data up to one year” [ Econintersect ]. 
New Normal: “Another factor, too, is the productive capacity that was built up to support a consumption engine that is no longer running at full tilt. Companies have more equipment and infrastructure than they are currently using, and with unused capacity, there is little reason to invest in new equipment or technologies. This helps explain the weak rate of capital spending in GDP – and may also help answer the vexing question of why productivity gains are so anemic. After all, productivity might be enhanced by innovation, which requires research and investment” [ Econintersect ]. 
Construction Spending, September 2016: “Construction spending remains weak but indications on housing do show limited improvement” [ Econoday ]. And: “well below the consensus forecast” [ Econintersect ]. But: “Overall, however – construction is now contracting after spending nearly 5 years expanding year-over-year. Still note that the rolling averages did improve” [ Econintersect ]. “But the confusion is that construction spending does not correlate to construction employment – casting doubt on the validity of one or both data sets.” 
Housing: “Nearly half of the homes purchased in major cities in Florida are all cash buyers. Cleveland is also seeing nearly half of all home purchases being made with all cash” [ Doctor Housing Bubble ]. The “All Cash Buyer Percentage” in Miami is 54% (!), and in Los Angeles 20%. Cleveland, 45% and Pittsburgh, 42%. 
Coops: “Today, National Cooperative Bank, known for providing banking solutions tailored to meet the needs of cooperatives nationwide, released its annual NCB Co-op 100®, listing the nation’s top 100 revenue-earning cooperative businesses. In 2015, these businesses posted revenue totaling approximately $223.8 billion. The NCB Co-op 100® remains the only annual report of its kind to track the profits and successes of cooperative businesses in the United States” [ Market Wired (DB)]. See also this list of coop-oriented podcasts . 
Shipping: “Study shows e-commerce consumers are loyal to UPS, USPS, and FedEx… in that order” [ DC Velocity ]. Non-union trails… 
Shipping: “Developers are having a harder time finding space for new warehouses in increasingly crowded and expensive U.S. cities. Their answer: build upward” [ Wall Street Journal , “Prologis to Build First Multistory Warehouse in the U.S.”]. “[M]ultistory warehouses are already common in countries like Japan and Singapore, as well as elsewhere in Asia and Europe, where vacant land is harder to find. ” Like New England mills… 
Shipping: “None of the world’s biggest container-shipping companies is likely to post a profit this year, a top executive of French shipping giant CMA CGM said Monday” [ Wall Street Journal , “Grim Year Forecast for Big Shipping Firms”]. 
Shipping: “A mainstay of the U.S. domestic shipping business is struggling to stay afloat. Lawyers who put International Shipholding Corp. into bankruptcy in July say they have a deal to bring the vessel owner’s troubled operations under the umbrella of a larger Florida-based maritime services firm. International Shipholding’s survival battle hasn’t gotten the attention of bigger turmoil in the global shipping business, but the 69-year-old company’s collapse highlights the impact that the downturn in demand is having across the entire shipping supply chain” [ Wall Street Journal ]. Wow. 
Shipping: “The cascading of increasingly larger containerships from the Asia-Europe trade to smaller trades is set for a second, “potentially more destructive”, phase, with a new generation of ultra large container vessels moving into north-south lanes” [ Lloyd’s List ]. 
Shipping: “A giant fire engulfed a beached tanker today killing at least ten workers at the Gadani shipbreaking area in Pakistan injuring another 50” [ Splash 247 ]. “A welding error led to a blast on the ship, which rapidly spread into a blaze with images and videos seen by Splash showing dark, vast plumes above the beached vessel.” 
Shipping: “Over 90 percent of world trade moves by sea, but once cargo is on a ship, it enters a zone with little information about the path ships are taking or the stops they are making. Only in recent years have the largest ships begun regularly transmitting location data, and even now, a ship may stop its transmission and ‘go dark’ at any time” [ MIT Technology Review ]. 
Honey for the Bears: “Economic Planning Associates Inc.’s (EPA) latest freight rail-car forecast for total deliveries in 2016 has edged up to 61,800 units from 60,300 units. But, weakness in the market for certain cars has prompted the firm to lower its estimate for 2017” [ Progressive Railroading ]. Another straw in the wind for 2017. “‘Strength in box cars, hi-cube covered hoppers and mid-sized hoppers prompted EPA to increase this year’s total delivery estimate. However, weaknesses in tank cars, coal cars, flat cars and mill gons will serve to lower 2017 assemblies to 41,000,’ stated EPA’s report, which was released yesterday. ‘After a further easing to 40,000 car deliveries in 2018, demand for rail cars will rebound on an annual basis, reaching 51,500 cars in 2021.'” 
Fodder for the Bulls: “But as the year has progressed, worries about the state of the world’s second-largest economy have abated as economic data have firmed. There’s a bevy of evidence from domestic figures and other metrics sensitive to the state of the Chinese economy now showing that the nation isn’t in the midst of a disruptive downturn” [ Bloomberg ]. 
Apparel: “In an industry famous for shrouding the connection between what it costs to manufacture garments and accessories, and the price that consumers pay for those items, Everlane seemingly fills a void; hence, its success. Price transparency aside, on the heels an array of garment manufacturing-related tragedies in recent years and amongst a larger call – particularly from millennials – for more ethically sound garments, Everlane founder and CEO, Michael Preysman, a former Investment Associate, saw a business opportunity in ethically made clothing” [ The Fashion Law ]. “In accordance with Everlane’s motto, we ask: Why would a brand based on transparency not list its factories?… Making vague and unsubstantiated claims in lieu of providing cold hard facts is a common trend that runs through the Everlane model.” 
Commodities: “BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest miner, is hot for electric vehicles” [ Bloomberg ]. “”As you see more renewables and EVs, we also will see an impact on copper demand,” Fiona Wild, BHP’s vice president, sustainability and climate change, said Tuesday at a conference in Shanghai hosted by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. ‘EVs at the moment have about 80 kilograms of copper in them. As they become more efficient, you see a greater amount of copper in those vehicles, so there’s always upside for copper.'” NOTE: “Bloomberg New Energy Finance” is listed on the cover of the McKinsey report on self-driving cars (PDF), whose infamous footnote 17 is analyzed here . They seem to have provided much of the data, including data for Exhibit 10. Talking their book? 
Commodities: “A slump in demand for iron ore and coal in Europe has resulted in a marked decrease in dry bulk throughput at the Port of Rotterdam. In the first nine months of the year, it handled 60.3m tonnes of dry bulk, or 7.8% lower than the same period last year, the port said” [ Lloyd’s List ]. 
The Bezzle: “Racial and Gender Discrimination in Transportation Network Companies” [ National Bureau of Economic Research ]. “Passengers have faced a history of discrimination in transportation systems. Peer transportation companies such as Uber and Lyft present the opportunity to rectify long-standing discrimination or worsen it. We sent passengers in Seattle, WA and Boston, MA to hail nearly 1,500 rides on controlled routes and recorded key performance metrics. Results indicated a pattern of discrimination, which we observed in Seattle through longer waiting times for African American passengers—as much as a 35 percent increase. In Boston, we observed discrimination by Uber drivers via more frequent cancellations against passengers when they used African American-sounding names. Across all trips, the cancellation rate for African American sounding names was more than twice as frequent compared to white sounding names.” 
Political Risk: “Variations in the market’s performance under Democratic and Republican administrations, measured by the average of yearly returns over more than 160 years, are so small as to be negligible, said Vanguard senior investment strategist Jonathan Lemco, a former professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University” [ Bloomberg ]. “A recent survey did show that the election ;is causing U.S. voters high anxiety . ;But according to readings of the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, the level of market anxiety is pretty normal, said Lemco. Volatility “hasn’t exceeded normal levels for a presidential election year, and there is no indication that it will deviate from typical patterns after the election,” he wrote in a recent report .” 
“Issues about morality, the market, and the constitutional order should have been central to the policy debate about macroeconomics. They weren’t. The standard policy frame eliminated them from discussion, causing a chasm in the policy debate in which the common framework shared by Keynes and Hayek disappeared” [ Evonomics ]. “Market fundamentalists incorrectly were portrayed as heartless and uncaring about the poor by followers of Keynes. Keynesians were incorrectly portrayed as unthinking supporters of big government by followers of Hayek. 
Today’s Fear & Greed Index: 22 Fear (previous close: 30, Fear) [ CNN ]. One week ago: 48 (Neutral). (0 is Extreme Fear; 100 is Extreme Greed). Last updated Nov 1 at 12:30pm. Nobody standing between Mr. Market and the pitchforks? 
Big Brother Is Watching You Watch 
“How Despots Use Twitter to Hunt Dissidents” [ Bloomberg ]. For years, Twitter has offered access to its “Firehose”—the global deluge of tweets, half a billion a day—to a number of companies that monitor social media. Some of those companies resell the information—mostly to marketers, but also to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. Some of these authorities use the data to track dissidents, as Bloomberg Businessweek has learned through dozens of interviews with industry insiders and more than 100 requests for public records from law enforcement agencies in the U.S. There’s nothing illegal about selling Twitter data, but it’s uncomfortable for a company that promotes itself as a medium for free speech and protest.” One more reason Twitter should be a coop? 
Standing Rock and #NoDAPL 
“Did #DAPL Security Worker Wielding an AR-15 Rifle Try to Infiltrate Native Water Protectors?” [ Democracy Now!] ” More details are emerging from Thursday, including video footage of a man who appears to be a Dakota Access security contractor holding a rifle, with his face covered by a bandana, apparently attempting to infiltrate a group of water protectors. A Standing Rock Sioux tribal member says he saw the man driving down Highway 1806 toward the main resistance camp with an AR-15 rifle on the passenger side of his truck. Protectors chased down his truck and then pursued him on foot in efforts to disarm him. In the video, the man can be seen pointing the rifle at the protectors as he attempts to flee into the water. He was ultimately arrested by Bureau of Indian Affairs police. Protectors say inside the man’s truck they found a DAPL security ID card and insurance papers listing his vehicle as insured by DAPL. ” 
Winter supplies for the protesters: Firewood is #1 [ Sacred Stone Camp ]. So if you’ve got a truck and a couple of cords… 
“How to Talk About #NoDAPL: A Native Perspective” [ Truthout ]. “In discussing #NoDAPL, too few people have started from a place of naming that we, as Indigenous people, have a right to defend our water and our lives, simply because we have a natural right to defend ourselves and our communities. When ‘climate justice,’ in a very broad sense, becomes the center of conversation, our fronts of struggle are often reduced to a staging ground for the messaging of NGOs.” 
“Dakota Access pipeline protests: UN group investigates human rights abuses” [ Guardian ]. “‘When you look at what the international standards are for the treatment of people, and you are in a place like the United States, it’s really astounding to hear some of this testimony,’ said Roberto Borrero, a representative of the International Indian Treaty Council.” 
“At least 1.3 million people had ‘checked in’ to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation on Facebook as a show of support for activists trying to block the pipeline, after one user claimed that authorities were tracking protesters on social media. The Sheriff’s Department said Monday that the claim was ‘absolutely false'” [ Los Angeles Times ]. So can I take that as a confirmation? Anyhow, “ strength of weak ties” with Facebook, but at least the logic is “I am Spartacus!” 
Black Injustice Tipping Point

If you feel left out by the latest updates and the neglect on the desktop, it’s simple as Apple deciding not to serve your segment’s needs. I know that it can feel quite personal to Mac devotees, like me, but it’s simply business and strategy.” In other words, the rollout wasn’t a debacle; Apple has decided it doesn’t want to serve the professional market any more (including, one would have thought critically, the market in content creation). Since the Mac accounts for 10% of Apple’s revenues, that may be a rational business decision. But if Cook really thinks “the iPad Pro is a replacement for a notebook or a desktop” he’s delusional, and I don’t care if he paid for a marketing study. I own both and I know. The ultimate strength of the Mac was always the Human Interface Guidelines — gradually being crapified as iOS idioms infest OS X — which imposed a similar “look and feel” across all applications that ran on the Mac platform. It would be nice if Ubuntu, say, could achieve the same thing. Sadly, that doesn’t seem likely, for reasons both technical and cultural. My first Mac was a 512KE. It was a good run.

20180,20180,Aid Convoy Is Hit in Syria as Cease-Fire Falters and Bombings Resume - The New York Times,Anne Barnard and Michael R. Gordon,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   A humanitarian aid convoy was attacked in Syria on Monday after the Syrian military declared that a   partial   was over and immediately began intensive bombardments in   areas of Aleppo, the divided city that has come to symbolize the ravages of the war. The convoy attack, military declaration and bombings were the strongest signs yet of the gradual unraveling of a broader agreement between Russia and the United States aimed at restarting peace talks to end the conflict in Syria, which has killed an estimated 500, 000 people and displaced millions. Minutes after the Syrian military declared the   over around sunset, aerial attacks began pummeling   neighborhoods of Aleppo, residents reported. The few remaining hospitals were back to overflowing, and rescuers struggled to find people in the dark, with the electricity out. By midnight, 34 people were reported killed. United Nations officials were dumbfounded by the attack on the convoy of 31 trucks, which was escorted by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and was carrying food, medicine and supplies bound for   areas of western Aleppo Province. The convoy was among the first to try to deliver humanitarian aid to these areas, a relief plan permitted under the   agreement. “Our outrage at this attack is enormous,” said Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations special representative on Syria. “The convoy was the outcome of a long process of permission and preparations to assist isolated civilians. ” At least 18 of the trucks were hit, United Nations officials said. Jan Egeland, a United Nations aid adviser to the Syria peace effort, said in a Twitter post: “Many killed and injured. ” Members of the Red Crescent and local activists said at least 12 people were killed, including the local head of the organization, Omar Barakat. Witnesses and rescuers said the convoy appeared to have been hit by multiple airstrikes, first destroying trucks and then two more hitting rescue workers as they helped the wounded. The tactic, known as a “ ” strike, has been used by Syrian and Russian warplanes. The rebels have no aircraft. The attack appeared to be the first airstrike to hit an aid convoy since the conflict began in 2011. The United Nations also reported the disruption of a second convoy that had finally received travel permits but was stopped in Homs Province by government forces that removed its medical supplies. Secretary of State John Kerry challenged the Syrian military’s declaration that the   was over, suggesting that the United States would hold Russia responsible for seeing that President Bashar   of Syria, one of its principal allies, implemented it. “The Syrians didn’t make the deal the Russians made the agreement,” Mr. Kerry said during meetings in New York before the annual United Nations General Assembly session. “The important thing is the Russians need to control Assad who evidently is indiscriminately bombing, including of humanitarian convoys. ” Mr. Kerry planned to meet with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, before the International Syria Support Group, the multinational body that has designed the plans for a reduction in violence and a political solution for Syria, assembles in New York on Tuesday morning. Still, a senior Obama administration official said Monday evening that it was unclear if the agreement could be salvaged. He also noted that the United States did not know if Syrian or Russian aircraft had carried out the attack In any case, a second administration official said, the attack cast doubt on the viability of the American goals. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic discussions. The Russians, however, defended the Syrian military. A senior Defense Ministry official in Moscow said it was “senseless” for the Syrian government to respect a   that he said had been repeatedly violated by Mr. Assad’s enemies. The Russian official, Lt. Gen. Sergei F. Rudskoi, accused   Syrian rebel groups of joining forces with extremists who have been denounced as terrorists by both Moscow and Washington. In a statement published in state news media, the Syrian Army’s general command placed blame on insurgents, saying they had violated the   and that the foreign powers backing them were supporting terrorism. After the Syrian military statement, residents in   sections of Aleppo reported intense aerial attacks, shattering the relative calm that the partial   had provided for the past week. Medical workers and residents reported at least 25 barrel bombs falling in less than an hour. Two were described as larger than usual, similar to garbage Dumpsters packed with shrapnel, and another attack was described as a ballistic missile strike. It had already become clear that the   was in trouble. It was not close to achieving the ambitious goals  —   notably the renewal of moribund talks about a political transition  —   that the United States and Russia set out when they declared the truce without clear endorsements from the combatants in Syria. What was meant to be a   measure, between Russia and the United States as much as between the groups in Syria, instead became a new source of acrimony. The new developments cast doubt on a plan by Russia and the United States to jointly attack groups in Syria that both countries consider terrorist threats. The situation worsened on Saturday night when   airstrikes killed more than 60 people that Russia and Syria said were Syrian soldiers. The United States called the episode a mistake, but the Syrian government called it proof that Washington was siding with terrorists. “Terrorist groups did not adhere to any of the points of the agreement,” the Syrian Army said in a statement. It added that the military, which refers to all armed opponents as terrorists, had shown great restraint in the face of what it said were 300 truce violations by insurgents. The opposition said the government had committed 250 violations. The government’s resumption of aerial attacks included strikes on Idlib, Daraa, the Damascus suburbs and other locations, with reports of multiple casualties, including children. Russia has repeatedly accused the United States of failing to draw a clear line between the more moderate rebel groups it supports and extremist groups like the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, now known as the Levant Conquest Front, which are also fighting against the Syrian government. In recent days, Moscow has escalated the tone of its assertions, saying that Washington was supporting terrorists. In Washington, the Pentagon said it was investigating the exact makeup of the Syrian troops who were killed on Saturday. A Defense Department official said that the strikes occurred at a Syrian military encampment where certain Syrian soldiers who had fallen out of favor with the military, and who were not wearing uniforms, were being detained. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still underway, said no conclusions had yet been reached.",0
20181,20181,5 Reasons to Consume this Every Day,Tru Foods Nutrition,"Keywords: Alzhemier's disease , anxiety , dementia , depression , food , health , IBD , IBS , immune system , mental health , nutrition , weight loss Fermented Foods: 5 Reasons to Consume this food Group Every Day 
I’m sure you have heard about fermented foods and are wondering if this is just a fad. Here are some reasons why fermented foods should not be just a fad but a food group to keep in your diet daily. What are Fermented Foods? 
Bacteria and yeast are used as part of the fermentation process that gives these foods a nutritional boost. The bacteria convert sugars and starches into lactic acid through a process called lacto-fermentation. The yeast undergoes a process called ethanol fermentation. 
These yeasts and bacteria that undergo the fermentation process boosts the nutritional content of the food. What it does to the food Provides beneficial bacteria that promote gut health Provides beneficial enzymes Increases the amount of B vitamins, biotin, and folate. Increases the bioavailability of minerals. Provides short chain fatty acids (which helps to improve your immune function) Provides you with GABA, your calming neurotransmitter How can eating fermented foods help me? Optimize your Gut Health 
Why this may not seem like a big deal, it is. Your immune system is in your gut and much of your serotonin is made in your gut. Your gut may be in bad shape from NSAIDS, antibiotics, unknown food allergies, the standard American diet and more. 
Ideally you want more “good” bacteria populating your gut as opposed to “bad” bacteria. Fermented foods can help shift the balance since most people who consume the Standard American “crap food” diet have a disrupted microbiome. 
So, you can take all the supplements in the world, but if your gut is in bad shape, are you even absorbing and benefiting from these supplements or are you just wasting your money? 
A healthy gut can help to balance and support your endocrine system, immune system, digestive system, and nervous system. So, as you can see, a healthy gut is critical to your well-being. Support your Immune System 
The more beneficial bacteria you have, the stronger your immune system is to fight off colds, flu, allergies and more. Almost 80% of your immune system is found in your gut, thus, it stands to reason that to maintain a strong immune system, one needs to support their gut health. 
Asthma and autoimmune conditions, among numerous other health issues, are all linked to having fewer good bacteria in your gut. The less diverse your microbiota is, the greater association with many chronic health issues. 
Adding in probiotic rich fermented foods can also shorten the duration of a cold or upper respiratory infection. Aid in weight loss 
Studies show that those with certain healthy bacteria in their gut can maintain a healthy weight while those with more negative strains have a greater incidence of gaining weight/difficulty losing weight. Obese people have different gut bacteria than lean individuals. 
In a 2011 study, it was found that kimchee had a significant impact on weight and body fat of those who are overweight and obese in the study. In a 2010 study, obese people were assigned to drink fermented milk for 12 weeks. Those that drank the fermented milk had significant fat loss as compared to the control group. Digestive/Bowel Issue Improvement 
Those with IBS or IBD may have reduced symptoms of diarrhea and constipation when fermented foods are added into the daily diet. Dr. David Williams states that to eliminate digestive issues, you need to improve the balance in the gut microbiome and one of the most effective ways of doing so is by adding in fermented foods. Kefir in studies, has shown to improve symptoms of IBS and IBD. Research has shown that anywhere from 50 to 75% of those who make this change (Adding in fermented foods) will notice a significant difference in their IBS symptoms. Improved mental health, mood control and behavior. 
The gut is considered your second brain. A healthy gut therefore can mean a healthy brain. Several probiotic strains have been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in short term studies. For this reason, to get more variety of probiotic strains, it is best to not stick with the same fermented food to eat over and over. Mix it up; for instance, have kefir one day, kombucha the next, fermented vegetables the next day and so forth. 
Many of you know that GABA is your calming neurotransmitter. But did you know that fermented foods can supply you with GABA too? Oral administration of fermented rice bran and other traditional fermented foods have been shown to increase GABA content significantly! Whereas GABA in the oral form may have limited benefits due to absorption issues. 
Another study looking at 700 college students found that those who ate a variety of fermented foods has less negative emotions than before such as anxiety, fear, moodiness, worry, envy, frustration, and loneliness. 
It is possible that the fermented foods not only healed leaky gut but also provided some needed GABA. Even in psychiatry they are starting to recognize the benefits of fermented foods for mood disorders. Reduce the risk of brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s. 
Some scientists have recently begun to consider the possibility that Alzheimer’s Disease is in fact an autoimmune disease. And as many of you may know, having one autoimmune condition puts you at risk for more autoimmune conditions down the road. For any autoimmune disease, the immune system must be supported. So, it would make sense that gut health needs to be addressed for AD. If you want to support your brain than I suggest that you add in fermented foods. 
Along with the benefits above, fermented foods can also benefit those with Autism and help prevent H-Pylori. You don’t need a whole lot of fermented foods daily. Start with small amounts until you know how your body will react and slowly build your way up to say 3 tablespoons of fermented vegetables or a cup of kefir per day. What to add in 

Look for the product to say raw and fermented. These foods should be in the refrigerator section of the store. Sauerkraut or other fermented vegetables : eat these cold, don’t heat them up. Bubbies pickles is a great way to get introduced to fermented foods. Kimchee : this is a Korean version of fermented cabbage, carrots, onions and garlic. Kefir: usually made from cow’s milk but is also made from goat milk or coconut milk. It has more of a drinkable texture than yogurt. I buy goat milk kefir and find that it is relatively thick and mix in some of my paleo granola and have this for breakfast. If you suspect any issues with milk it is best to opt for the coconut kefir or the goat milk kefir. If you have asthma or chronic sinus congestion, avoid the kefir until issues resolve. Opt for the other fermented choices instead. Tempeh: Indonesian type of “cake” with a nutty taste and chewy texture. A good vegan source of protein too. Kombucha : a fizzy fermented tea. Most stores carry a variety of flavors now. Don’t go overboard on the kombucha however. Some people who drink kombucha in excess amounts (i.e.: several bottles per day) report symptoms of gas and bloating. Miso: a fermented soybean paste which can be used in soups and sauces. A miso broth soup is a great way to start a meal and very easy to make. 
Notice I did not sat yogurt. While some yogurts may contain some probiotics, many others are sugary processed foods in disguise. Yogurt is also not going to pack as powerful of a punch as the above-mentioned foods.

20182,20182,"Hot-Air Balloon Crash in Texas Kills 16, Officials Say - The New York Times","David Montgomery, Maggie Astor and Christine Hauser","LOCKHART, Tex.  —   A   balloon carrying 16 people caught fire and crashed in Central Texas on Saturday, officials said, and the local authorities said no one had survived. The balloon crashed in a pasture near Lockhart, a town about 30 miles south of Austin, said Lynn Lunsford, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial reports from officials said the balloon had plummeted after catching fire in the air, but at least one witness said it might have struck   power lines before hitting the ground and bursting into flames. The accident occurred shortly after 7:40 a. m. Mr. Lunsford said. In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Lunsford said that officials were on their way to the site and that the National Transportation Safety Board had been notified. The agency will be in charge of the investigation. Mr. Lunsford said he did not know what had led to the crash or whether there had been a distress call. The Caldwell County sheriff, Daniel Law, said in a statement, “It does not appear at this time that there were any survivors. ” By late afternoon, investigators had yet to publicly identify any of the victims or their relations to one another. But local news reports, quoting unnamed sources, identified the pilot of the balloon as Alfred Nichols, known as Skip. He was listed as an owner and the chief pilot of Heart of Texas Hot Air Balloon Rides. Mr. Nichols’s Facebook page reflected two passions:   balloons and dogs. In the past two weeks, he had posted a YouTube video about a Russian balloonist who set a speed record for traveling around the world in a balloon (11 days) and an alert about   dog adoption days at the Austin Animal Center. On July 21, he posted aerial photos of a brilliant sunrise. “Another great flight in Houston,” he wrote. He had two dogs, named Elmo and Joplin, and on Thursday evening, less than two days before the crash, he posted a photo of one of them resting on him. “Goodnight to you too Elmo must you use me as your pillow?” he wrote. By Saturday afternoon, the comment sections for that photo and the Facebook page of the balloon company were filled with condolences and remembrances. “Skip, I shall for years to come be reminiscing about all of the awesome times we enjoyed at your Springdale Ln. Des Peres Missouri house and my Kirkwood Missouri house and tearing it up at all of the clubs my friend,” Mark Grundmann wrote. “You will be missed. ” Amid the outpouring were urgent requests for people who lived near Mr. Nichols to check on Elmo and Joplin. At 3:52 p. m. a woman, Wendy Bartch, posted on the company’s page that the dogs were “being cared for. ” Ms. Bartch, Mr. Grundmann and others who posted on Facebook and Twitter did not respond to private messages. Voice mail messages left late Saturday afternoon at two phone numbers listed for the balloon company were not returned. Margaret Wylie, 66, who lives a   from the crash site, said she had seen the balloon explode into a fireball after it struck the ground on a neighbor’s property. She said she had been on her back porch when her dog “really started raising the roof. ” “When I looked over toward my neighbor’s property,” Ms. Wylie said, “that’s about the time I saw flames shooting out sideways, and then just a fireball. At 66, that’s not something I want to see again. ” The crash occurred in a rural area less than an hour from Austin, in a large field scorched from the summer heat. Several big power lines atop towers ran east and west at the field’s southern end. A few farmhouses were visible in the distance. Throngs of journalists arrived by late morning, but investigators had sealed off the perimeter and kept them from the spot where the balloon had fallen. Ms. Wylie said that based on what she had heard, she believed “the balloon hit the wires, and it caused the deflation of the balloon, and then it hit the ground. ” She initially heard a pop, she said, and then another that sounded like gunfire. “I figured that was the balloon hitting the power line,” she said. “By the time I looked that direction, it was on the ground, and I heard a whooshing sound and an explosion. ” Ms. Wylie said the balloon was so engulfed in flames that she did not see any passengers. She immediately called 911, she said. The red, white, blue and yellow balloon apparently separated from the basket and was stretched along the ground about a mile from the crash site. The power lines near the site belong to the Lower Colorado River Authority Transmission Services Corporation, The Austin   reported. A spokeswoman for the utility told the newspaper that two circuits were down after the crash, although no customers were without power. But neither she nor investigators could confirm whether the power lines had been involved in the crash. Erik Grosof, an official with the National Transportation Safety Board, said the crash had been classified as a major accident because of the “significant loss of life. ” A full investigative team from the safety board was to arrive later Saturday, he said, and the F. B. I. had been asked to help look at the evidence, a normal request after major accidents. Asked to confirm reports that 16 people had been killed, Mr. Grosof said, “Right now, we have a number of fatalities. ” Sixteen deaths would make the accident one of the worst   balloon crashes in history, surpassed only by a crash in Luxor, Egypt, that killed 19 people in February 2013. In that crash, the balloon was sailing over archaeological sites at dawn when a fire caused an explosion in a gas canister and the balloon plummeted more than 1, 000 feet to the ground. Two people survived  —   the pilot and a passenger, who jumped from the basket from about 30 feet. Nineteen tourists died, including the wife of the surviving passenger. Before Saturday, the worst balloon accident in the United States occurred in August 1993 in Woody Creek, Colo. near Aspen, when a wind gust blew a balloon into a power line complex. The basket was severed and fell more than 100 feet, killing all six people aboard. Replying to a question at a news conference, Mr. Grosof said it was his “understanding” that the balloon tour was run by Heart of Texas Hot Air Balloon Rides, based in New Braunfels. A person reached at its reservation service said the company offered flights in the Austin area coinciding with the sunrise. It also operates near San Antonio and in other areas. She declined to speak about the accident. The sheriff’s statement said that a call had come in to the local law enforcement authorities after 7:40 a. m. reporting a possible vehicle accident. When emergency responders arrived, “it was apparent that the reported fire was the basket portion of a   balloon,” the statement said. Chris O’Neil, a National Transportation Safety Board spokesman, said investigators were expected to remain on the scene for a few days. Seven to 10 days after the field work is completed, he said, they will release a preliminary report. Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement extending his condolences, calling the accident a “heartbreaking tragedy. ” “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, as well as the Lockhart community,” he said. “The investigation into the cause of this tragic accident will continue, and I ask all of Texas to join us in praying for those lost. ”",0

SPUTNIK 
The election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the US certainly sent shockwaves around the world. But perhaps the uppermost sense is one of huge relief that Hillary Clinton was kept out of the White House. 
For most ordinary citizens around the world, Clinton, her multi-billion-dollar election campaign and the fawning corporate media coverage represented everything that is perceived as fundamentally wrong in Western politics. 
Her cronyism goes so far that she would not hesitate to start a world war with Russia, or whoever, in order to appease her corporate sponsors and indulge her deluded notion of “exceptional liberalism”. 
Trump’s stunning victory is a victory for common people and common sense. Despite the Western media’s systematic shielding of Clinton from criticism, a good number of ordinary Americans and other nationals around the world could clearly see her irredeemable flaws. 
She is a self-enriching puppet for Big Finance and the military-industrial complex. And, as her email scandal shows, a consummate liar on top. Donald Trump is a billionaire property tycoon with a big mouth and uncouth manner. He has never held an elected office before. It is unprecedented that he should become the president of the US. 
Donald Trump is a billionaire property tycoon with a big mouth and uncouth manner. He has never held an elected office before. It is unprecedented that he should become the president of the US. 
Will he really “make America great again”? Will he really deliver on massive infrastructure investments to regenerate impoverished working-class communities across America? We don’t know if he just an opportunist conman, or if he really does have a humble heart to reach out to all the “forgotten people” that he speaks about. One can hope. 
But one thing is for sure. Trump is no warmonger. And he doesn’t seem to be a puppet that can be pushed around. 
“We will deal fairly with everyone” 
In one of the live TV debates with Clinton during the campaign, Trump surprised many viewers when he said, apparently sincerely, that he would never commit a first-strike nuclear attack against any nation. It took a lot of guts and moral integrity to say that. Clinton didn’t answer the question, but her past record as Secretary of State shows that she has no hesitation about launching illegal wars and murdering foreign heads of state. 
Trump has also spoken several times about restoring friendly relations with America’s biggest nuclear rival Russia. He took a lot of heat for that from the Clinton campaign and the biased US media, who accused him of being a “stooge” for Russian President Vladimir Putin. To his credit, Trump did not cave in to the anachronistic “Russian baiting”, which has been a staple of American politics for decades. During his acceptance speech as President-elect, Trump repeated his oft-mentioned desire for the US to base its foreign relations on “partnership” instead of “hostility and conflict”. 
Notably, Russia’s Vladimir Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on winning the White House. Reciprocating goodwill, Putin said he hoped to work with Trump so that Russia and the US can “restore relations from their current critical condition”. 
Surely, this is the point. To replace outmoded ideological stereotypes and animosity with a pragmatic mutual respect to cooperate. Russia and its leader are not the enemy of the US, Europe nor the rest of the world – unless you are a terrorist network seeking illicit regime change. Architects of Endless “Regime Change” wars 
Russia and its leader are not the enemy of the US, Europe nor the rest of the world – unless you are a terrorist network seeking illicit regime change. 
The people who have demonized Russia are ideologues in Washington and their surrogates among European governments and the Western corporate media. That negative image of Russia does not match reality as ordinary people perceive it, including many ordinary Americans. Russia did not destabilize Ukraine. It did not annex Crimea. Russia was not involved in shooting down a civilian airliner. It is not massacring civilians in Syria. In Syria, it is helping a sovereign state defeat terrorist mercenaries in a US-sponsored covert war for regime change. Russia is not a sports-drug pariah. It is not hacking computer systems nor subverting foreign democracies. These are all just false ideological constructs manufactured by the Western establishment and its subservient media. 
Ordinary citizens around the world, especially those in the US, know that. Their real-world concerns are dealing with poverty, unemployment and crumbling societies. This stuff about “Putin being the new Hitler” and “threatening the free world” is just so much baloney. 
Maybe because Trump is not a career politician or a Washington insider he knows all that too. And he knows that ordinary Americans are not being listened to by the establishment. That’s why Trump’s victory comes as such a shock. 
The political class have been so wrong on almost every issue, whether it was the Brexit and discontent with the European Union, or foreign relations with Russia, or Trump’s chances of winning the presidency. 
The Western political class have gotten it so wrong on so many issues because it is divorced from the reality as it affects most people. Aloof, elitist, out of touch and undemocratic. 
Yet this Western ruling class, as embodied by Hillary Clinton, would be prepared to start even more wars around the world than they already have, based on their own twisted self-serving logic. 
Consider these figures just released by the Pentagon. Under President Obama – who advocated for Clinton – US military exports to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast despots are double the amount under George W Bush. This weapons supply has gone towards arming jihadi terror groups. Clinton approved of this arms bazaar for terrorists when she was in office as part of Washington’s regime-change schemes. Fooling the masses – Defeated 
Yet these people like Obama and Clinton spout all sorts of “humanitarian” and “moralistic” mumbo-jumbo. They are liars. And they are the most cynical of corrupt politicians. The very breed of politician-puppets that ordinary decent people around the world have come to despise. 
Trump, for all his personal flaws, is in a different category. He is astute enough to know that the pain of ordinary citizens stems from a badly broken economic system. Can an arch capitalist like Trump fix chronic capitalism? It’s doubtful, unless he radically shifts to a new form of socialist policy. 
But the main good thing about Trump is that he is a pragmatist who at least appears to be on the side of ordinary people and on the side of restoring peaceful relations with other nations, Russia in particular. 
The prominent people dejected about Trump are the political class both in the US and Europe and their media echo chambers. It is notable that Germany’s Merkel and France’s Hollande both affected an air of disapproval over Trump’s victory – unlike Putin who magnanimously congratulated. Hollande said he would be “vigilant” in his future dealings with Trump. What is he talking about? 
That’s why Merkel and Hollande will be next to get kicked out of office in forthcoming elections. Like Obama, Clinton and the American establishment, the pro-US European ruling parties are so out of touch with reality. 
The demonization of Russia is a reflection of how disconnected the Western political class are from their own people. Ordinary people around the world want jobs, prosperity and peace. They know they can’t afford futile hostilities with Russia as have been foisted on them by their rulers, while such urgent social needs go neglected. Crazy as it may seem, Trump’s win may be a chance for the US to redeem. And for the world to heave a huge sigh of relief.

20184,20184,Kaine says Clinton would seek updated war-making powers,Larry,"Yahoo News Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine said in an interview published Monday that, if elected, Hillary Clinton would quickly ask Congress for fresh legal authority to make war on the so-called Islamic State and other terrorist groups around the world. “Hillary has said that that’s something she wants to do very early in her administration,” the Virginia senator said. He made his remarks in an interview with “ The Axe Files ,” hosted by David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Obama. Kaine said the former secretary of state will press lawmakers to rewrite the Sept. 14, 2001, Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) that set the stage for the invasion of Afghanistan and has underpinned the entire war on terrorism. Obama has invoked the measure to argue that his undeclared but escalating war on ISIS is legal, a position Kaine had previously dismissed as an “ Alice in Wonderland ” strategy. Clinton believes that “it’s time for us to take that now-outdated authorization, and really think about what we are confronting, and work together to reach some legislative-executive accord about what it is we’re doing,” Kaine told Axelrod. “It’s time for Congress to get back in the game and refine and revise that authorization.” Seventy percent of the current Congress wasn’t in office when lawmakers approved the 2001 AUMF, and America’s terrorist enemies have “morphed and changed,” the senator argued. Obama called in a May 2013 speech for revising and repealing the 2001 AUMF, saying it was time to get America off “a perpetual wartime footing.” His top aides have since admitted that the job will fall to the next president . No lawmaker has worked harder than Kaine to get Congress to debate and vote on an AUMF that specifically covers the Islamic State. “We have allowed President Obama to wage an executive war of his own choosing without any congressional permission for nearly two years,” Kaine told Virginia Military Institute cadets at their graduation in mid-May. “It’s not hard to imagine that a future president will use this example to also justify initiating war without the permission of Congress.” Clinton had sent mixed messages about whether she would seek a new AUMF, but lined up earlier this year squarely behind her running mate’s view. A spokesman for her campaign, Jesse Lehrich, told Yahoo News in July that the former secretary of state “agrees with Senator Kaine that if we are serious about confronting ISIS, Congress ought to express its resolve to stand behind our military and win this fight by passing a new AUMF.” After stalling at the request of vulnerable Democratic lawmakers facing the 2014 midterm elections, Obama finally submitted an ISIS-specific AUMF to Congress in February 2015, but it’s essentially dead . The legislation reflected his national security aides’ desire that it not tie his hands. The document authorized airstrikes in Iraq and Syria in the following three years. It forbade the use of American ground troops in “ enduring offensive ground combat operations ” — a term the White House described as deliberately vague. It also allowed strikes against “individuals and organizations fighting for, on behalf of, or alongside ISIL” anywhere in the world. Democrats have balked at supporting such a sweeping measure. Republicans have pointed to the three-year limit and the ground-combat language to argue that the AUMF improperly binds the hands of Obama’s successor. The truth of the matter is that both sides see political peril in the president’s proposal. Democrats recall how voting in favor of the Iraq War helped to doom Clinton’s 2008 presidential ambitions. And Republicans, who could vote to remove the language they describe as objectionable, prefer to criticize Obama’s handling of the conflict without taking any steps that might make them co-owners of the strategy.",1
20185,20185,Is Traditional Polling Underselling Donald Trump’s True Strength? - The New York Times,Nate Cohn,"Hillary Clinton’s lead in general election polls has faded over the last few weeks. One reason might be that a growing number of Republicans are coalescing around Donald Trump’s candidacy. Another part of the explanation? Fewer   telephone polls. So far this year,   telephone surveys have tended to show Mrs. Clinton leading by a slightly larger margin than those conducted online. There hasn’t been a   telephone survey since Mr. Trump beat back all his rivals early this month. So Mrs. Clinton’s seeming lead has seemed to shrink particularly fast. Why does Mr. Trump do better in online polls? And are the online polls right? The prevailing theory of Mr. Trump’s edge in online surveys is “social desirability bias”  —   the idea that poll respondents might be less likely to divulge a socially undesirable opinion, like support for a controversial candidate like Mr. Trump, to a live interviewer than in an online questionnaire. This is not an entirely new phenomenon for Mr. Trump. He fared better in online surveys during the Republican primaries than he did in telephone surveys, a tendency first identified by Jonathan Robinson at Catalist, a data firm associated with the Democratic Party. The pattern lasted all the way through the end of the primary season. The online pollster Morning Consult conducted a study indicating that social desirability bias drove his edge. Thomas Edsall, writing in the The New York Times, raised the possibility that the same phenomenon explains Mr. Trump’s strength in the online polls right now, suggesting that Mr. Trump could outperform traditional surveys showing a wide lead for Mrs. Clinton. Social desirability bias might well be helping Mr. Trump in online polls. But it’s a lot less clear now than it was during the primary season. And even if that is what’s going on, there’s no reason to assume the online polls are right. With the primary season effectively over, I think we can say, with some qualifications, that the   surveys were probably more accurate than the online surveys. Why? The actual results just weren’t as good for Mr. Trump as the balance of online surveys predicted they would be. Mr. Trump has now won 41 percent of the popular vote  —   including the string of recent contests where he clearly broke through and outperformed his prior vote tallies. On Super Tuesday, he won just 34 percent of the vote  —   and he won about 39 percent between then and the New York primary. But the online surveys showed Mr. Trump at 38 percent as early as the new year, broke 40 percent around Super Tuesday, and were in the   by March 15. His actual vote tallies consistently trailed the online surveys. They look a lot more like what the   surveys showed at the time. The Upshot published a series of demographic models throughout the primary season that estimated how Mr. Trump might have fared if the country had voted on that date. At the time, our estimates showed Mr. Trump did not approach 40 percent of the vote until March 15. With the benefit of hindsight, we can do even better: Take all of the results so far, and estimate how Mr. Trump would do in a national primary held at any given stage of the race. These estimates, based on the actual results, consistently match more closely with the live interview surveys than the online ones. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the social desirability bias theory is wrong. It’s possible that other differences between online and   polls  —   likely voter models or sampling procedures  —   accounted for Mr. Trump’s additional strength. All told, it’s not enough evidence to make me think that the online polls are more accurate about Mr. Trump than the   surveys. Mr. Trump’s advantage in online polls is a lot less clear in the general election than it was in the primary. It does seem to exist. Mrs. Clinton generally leads Mr. Trump by less in online surveys. On balance, though, Mr. Trump has about 2. 5 more points in   polls. He’s actually earning a smaller share of the vote in online surveys than in the   polls  —   the exact opposite of what one might expect if he were being hurt by social desirability bias in   polls. So what’s going on? The main difference between the online and   polls is there are vastly more undecided voters in the online surveys. In the   surveys, there are correspondingly more supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump, with Mrs. Clinton apparently gaining slightly more ground. Why are there so many undecided voters? It’s a methodological quirk, relating to the way that online pollsters have to ask questions. Consider, for instance, how the typical NBC   Street Journal poll, a   survey, asked the horse race question in March: “And, if the election for president were held today, and Donald Trump were the Republican candidate and Hillary Clinton were the Democratic candidate, for whom would you vote?” Notice that “undecided” or “other” or “don’t know” isn’t a stated option? Live interview pollsters can do that, since the respondent is free to say “other” or “I don’t know,” and the interviewer can record it as such. In the   poll, 9 percent volunteered “other” or “neither,” and 2 percent weren’t sure. But this is a lot more challenging for an online pollster. If you put “don’t know” or “other” as an option, a lot of people are going to take it. But if you don’t include it, you have a problem: What will the truly undecided voters do? They could provide an unreliable answer or leave the survey. If you provide them the option to “skip,” they might skip through the whole questionnaire. In the end, many of the online pollsters give voters the option to choose undecided. Voters are taking it in huge numbers. You can see the effect in another type of NBC News survey: those conducted online by SurveyMonkey. At the beginning of May, the first NBC   general election poll included an explicit “don’t know” option. Mrs. Clinton led, 43 to 37, with 19 percent selecting “don’t know. ” But in their second survey, conducted after Mr. Trump emerged triumphant, “undecided” was no longer an option. Respondents could go out of their way to skip the question and leave it blank, but they couldn’t simply say “undecided. ” The result? Mrs. Clinton led, 49 to 44 percent, with just 7 percent electing to skip the question. This doesn’t mean there isn’t a social desirability bias against Mr. Trump. One could imagine, for instance, that Mr. Trump would receive notably more support in the online surveys if they had as few undecided voters as the   surveys. But it does make it harder to compare the results of the online and   surveys, since there’s no way to be sure whether Mr. Trump would still be doing better if there were fewer undecided voters. You could imagine, for instance, that a bunch of Bernie Sanders’s supporters will take the “don’t know” option, simply to spare themselves from having to support Mrs. Clinton. In the most recent YouGov online survey, 30 percent of Mr. Sanders’s supporters were selecting either “someone else,” “not sure” or “wouldn’t vote. ” But in the recent New York   News   survey, just 9 percent wound up in those categories. Mrs. Clinton was the beneficiary: She held 82 percent of Mr. Sanders’s supporters, but just 55 percent in the YouGov poll. (Mr. Trump did fare better among Mr. Sanders’s supporters in the YouGov poll, earning 15 percent of the vote, than in The New York   News poll, where he won 10 percent.) My guess is that Mr. Trump would still fare slightly better in the online surveys than in the   polls, even if the number of undecided voters was equal. Mrs. Clinton tends to lead by a hair more among decided voters, even after removing the “undecided” voters. But it’s not clear that it’s a social desirability effect, or that it’s more accurate.",0
20186,20186,‘Suplex’ in Chinese? Professional Wrestling Tries a Big New Market - The New York Times,Neil Gough,"SHANGHAI  —   Wang Bin looked down. A man wearing a blue skintight unitard writhed at his feet. Mr. Wang grinned. This was the moment he had been waiting for. So, too, had Cheng Shi. When Mr. Wang lifted the writhing man and slammed him to the floor for a   it completed Mr. Cheng’s dream of watching a professional wrestler  —   battling in that most American of fake spectacles  —   who hailed from China. “I feel very proud and excited to see him onstage tonight, and so do all the fans,” Mr. Cheng, a    student who makes fan videos for a Chinese audience, said before the match. He pointed at the screen of his smartphone to indicate the thousands of people watching him on his live broadcast. “We are very, very excited. ” Looking for eyeballs and new money sources, World Wrestling Entertainment  —   the company that brought Hulk Hogan and Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson into American living rooms  —   has grand ambitions for a bigger but much more difficult market. It has started a new service     matches and commentary. It is also combing China’s provinces for more beefy talent like Mr. Wang. China presents formidable challenges. Entertainment names like Netflix and Rupert Murdoch have taken aim at China’s population of 1. 4 billion only to run afoul of the country’s tight controls over media. Wrestling’s cartoon violence and sometimes salacious story lines could attract unwanted attention from the government. And while it has its fans,       is largely   among mainland Chinese. “There is no presence of product over here,” said John Cena, the   wrestler and action movie star who has learned to speak some Chinese as part of the push. By tackling the language, he added, “I’m kind of a vehicle to leverage what we’ve done. ” Wrestling’s answer is to go local  —   and digital. Bypassing   broadcast television, it has teamed with a   company to reach fans though computers and mobile devices. It has also geared up efforts to introduce a new audience to the suplex, the body slam and the  . W. W. E. has hired four   social media directors in Shanghai to maintain   social media accounts for its wrestlers and executives. It is also hosting viewing parties, like one this month in the Chinese city of Guangzhou, in which locals devoured pizza and cream sodas while watching a    wrestling match and playing the W. W. E. ’s latest Xbox video game. Success requires exposing Chinese audiences to a new type of entertainment  —   a choreographed drama in which the outcome is known, though its dangers and injuries are sometimes shockingly real. “They’ve never really seen anything like us,” said Paul Levesque, W. W. E. ’s executive in charge of talent and live events, who is also a partly retired wrestler better known as Triple H. “The athleticism is very real. The story lines and the theater part of it is where they had a hard time with the blurred line of that. ” To friends unfamiliar with wrestling, “I find that the shortest way to tell them is to say it’s an American version  —   a global version  —   of the kung fu novel,” said Jay Li, a longtime executive at multinational companies in China who in April joined W. W. E. as its general manager for greater China. “They get it immediately, because they immediately have a cultural connection and a mental image of what this is about. ” While a lot of attention has been placed in recent years on the expansion into Hollywood of Chinese companies like Dalian Wanda, most foreign entertainment firms struggle to make comparable inroads in China. For some, like Disney, penetrating China has meant giving the Communist Party greater say over its business on the mainland. Sports  —   or something that looks like a sport  —   might be different. Sports enjoys thematic support from the government, which is big on hosting international events like the Olympics and promoting sports like soccer. China’s push to get soccer into schools and make the country a power in the sport has led companies to pay big sums for broadcast rights. “Sports has historically been underdeveloped in China and online, and a lot of players are looking for ways to monetize that,” said Vivek Couto, a founder and a director at Media Partners Asia, an industry research consultant. Professional wrestling could use the eyeballs. Like other media companies, W. W. E. is grappling with the new world of   in which viewers drop their cable subscriptions and order shows, à la carte, via the internet. International viewers offer one potential growth area. They make up only about a quarter of the paid subscribers on W. W. E. ’s digital subscription service, which is one of the biggest contributors to the company’s bottom line. As China shows, international growth isn’t always easy. In October, W. W. E. told investors it was still waiting to offer subscriptions directly to Chinese viewers. For now it works with a Chinese video company service called PPTV, which streams the company’s weekly flagship shows, called “SmackDown” and “RAW,” with   Mandarin commentary. (Suplex, in case you were wondering, translates as deshi beishuai, or “  back throw. ”) PPTV subscriptions start at less than $3 per month, roughly a third of what W. W. E. ’s own subscription service costs outside China, and include movies and other shows. Much rides on Mr. Wang, W. W. E. ’s first mainland wrestler. The company’s social media team works to make him a star  —   his verified account on the Weibo social media service recently featured videos of him training at W. W. E. ’s huge facility in Orlando, Fla. Seven other mainlanders, six men and one woman, will relocate to Orlando in January. Mr. Wang, a    native of eastern Anhui Province, was an athlete after middle school, a member of the provincial rowing team. He later moved to Shanghai and took up sparring, and caught the attention of representatives from Inoki Genome Federation, a big Japanese wrestling and mixed martial arts promotion. Mr. Wang spent three years in Japan before he was noticed by W. W. E. He signed a   development deal with the American company and started training in Orlando over the summer in preparation for his China debut. When the moment finally arrived in Shanghai in September, Mr. Wang entered the arena to modern Chinese music. He gave the crowd a traditional Chinese, kung   greeting, pressing his right fist into his left palm. His opponent, a wrestler named Bo Dallas, was booed by the Shanghai crowd before Mr. Wang tossed him to the mat, pinning him in a   on the second try. Mr. Wang doesn’t yet have a defined act or character, or even a flashy name. One of the oldest such personas in W. W. E.  wrestling is the foreign heel, or bad guy those include personas like Mr. Fuji, a Japanese villain played by the late Harry Fujiwara. In an interview, Mr. Wang said he wasn’t a big believer in appealing to such nationalistic tropes. “People shouldn’t see you for your nationality or ethnic group,” he said. “It’s less about that and more about what you can do, personally, as a warrior and a figure in the ring. ”",0
20187,20187,5 Fort Hood Soldiers Dead and 4 Missing in Texas Floods - The New York Times,Jonah Engel Bromwich,"Five soldiers were killed and four were missing after a truck overturned Thursday during a routine training mission at the Fort Hood military post in Texas, the Army said. Three other soldiers were rescued from water near the vehicle and were listed in stable condition. They were taken to a medical center on the post, according to a statement. Chris Haug, a spokesman for Fort Hood, said that floodwaters from recent rains were believed to have overturned the truck, a Light Medium Tactical Vehicle, while the soldiers were using a low water crossing, but that the episode would be investigated. Mr. Haug said the soldiers were on a mission that “they do every day,” and driving on “a normal dirt road” that was not known to be a problem. The area has been inundated with heavy rain over the past week. Around the time of the accident, concerns about flooding had caused emergency personnel to close a paved road that runs parallel to the dirt road the soldiers were traveling on. “All the low water crossings are potentially dangerous when we’ve had this much rain,” said Tyler Broadway, another Fort Hood spokesman. The accident, which took place about 12 miles north of the base’s main area, was reported shortly after 11 a. m. on Thursday. Search parties were sent immediately. Rescue teams were searching for the missing soldiers by air, land and water, the statement said. The bodies of the dead soldiers were recovered downstream from where the truck overturned. Their names will not be released until their families are notified. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for all of northern and central Texas on Thursday afternoon, with rainstorms expected to continue through Friday afternoon. May brought a   amount of rain to the state, resulting in the deaths of at least six other people. Gov. Greg Abbott issued a statement, saying, “Texas stands ready to provide any assistance to Fort Hood as they deal with this tragedy. ” This is not the first fatal episode in recent months during a training exercise at Fort Hood. In November, a Black Hawk helicopter crashed during an exercise at the post, killing four crew members.",0

20189,20189,"FRANCE: Police are under siege in Muslim migrant areas in and around Paris, also known as “NO-GO Zones”",BareNakedIslam,"BNI Store Oct 29 2016 FRANCE: Police are under siege in Muslim migrant areas in and around Paris, also known as “NO-GO Zones” Despite President Francois Hollande’s continued insistence that there aren’t any Muslim NO-GO Zones in France, police say otherwise. NO-GO Zones are violent and lawless Muslim migrant dominated neighborhoods around Paris that are virtually off limits to non-Muslims and a threat to police and firefighters. Gatestone (h/t Brenda K) There is a mountain of evidence that confirms the existence of Muslim ‘NO GO ZONES’ (Zones Urbaines Sensibles) where non-Muslims are afraid to go because they regularly are attacked by gangs of Muslims who rule these lawless neighborhoods. Host-country authorities have effectively lost control over many no-go zones and are often unable or unwilling to provide even basic public aid, such as police, fire fighting and ambulance services, out of fear of being attacked by Muslim youth. Muslim enclaves in European cities are also breeding grounds for Islamic radicalism and pose a significant threat to Western security. Europe’s no-go zones are the by-product of decades of multicultural policies that have encouraged Muslim immigrants to create parallel societies and remain segregated from — rather than become integrated into — their European host nations. A 120-page research paper entitled “No-Go Zones in the French Republic: Myth or Reality?” documented dozens of French neighborhoods “where police and gendarmerie cannot enforce the Republican order or even enter without risking confrontation, projectiles, or even fatal shootings.” A landmark 2,200-page report, “Banlieue de la République” (Suburbs of the Republic) found that Seine-Saint-Denis and other Parisian suburbs are becoming “separate Islamic societies” cut off from the French state, and where Islamic Sharia law is rapidly displacing French civil law. The report said that Muslim immigrants are increasingly rejecting French values and instead are immersing themselves in literal violent Islam. The problem of no-go zones is well documented, but multiculturalists and their politically correct supporters vehemently deny that they exist. Some are now engaged in a concerted campaign to discredit and even silence those who draw attention to the issue. A 120-page research paper entitled “No-Go Zones in the French Republic: Myth or Reality?” documented dozens of French neighborhoods “where police and gendarmerie cannot enforce the Republican order or even enter without risking confrontation, projectiles, or even fatal shootings.” In October 2011, a 2,200-page report, “Banlieue de la République” (Suburbs of the Republic) found that Seine-Saint-Denis and other Parisian suburbs are becoming “separate Islamic societies” cut off from the French state and where Islamic Sharia law is rapidly displacing French civil law. The report also showed how the problem is being exacerbated by radical Muslim preachers who are promoting the social marginalization of Muslim immigrants in order to create a parallel Muslim society in France that is ruled by Sharia law. The television presenter asks: “What if we went to the suburbs?” Obertone replies: “I do not recommend this. Not even we French dare go there anymore. But nobody talks about this in public, of course. Nor do those who claim, ‘long live multiculturalism,’ and ‘Paris is wonderful!’ dare enter the suburbs.” Back in 2015, the Mayor of Paris threatened to sue FOX News for reporting on the problem of Muslim NO-GO Zones. As a result, several FOX commentators were forced to issue apologies on the air for claiming after the Charlie Hebdo attack that there are Muslim-ruled “no-go zones” in France.

20190,20190,Och-Ziff to Pay Over $400 Million in Bribery Settlement - The New York Times,Alexandra Stevenson,"Africa once represented a lucrative new market for a giant New York hedge fund. More than a decade later, the hedge fund,   Capital Management, and its founder, Daniel Och, are paying the price for what the United States government has charged were more than $100 million in bribes paid to government officials in Libya, Chad, Niger, Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo to secure natural resources deals and other investments. OZ Africa Management, a unit of   pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Thursday to one count of conspiracy  —   an unusual violation for a hedge fund of a federal law aimed at preventing bribery of foreign officials. Mr. Och, who is also chief executive of   agreed to pay $2. 2 million to settle a   violation with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Joel M. Frank,  ’s chief financial officer, also agreed to settle charges that executives ignored red flags. And   itself will pay a $413 million fine as part of a   agreement to settle both the criminal and civil charges. The settlement is one of the biggest criminal penalties levied on a United States hedge fund firm, dealing a blow to   as it works to stem withdrawals from its investors, which include state pension funds, endowments and foundations. The court filings by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and securities regulators lay out a complex and elaborate tale of clandestine meetings and dealings with   officials in the regimes of Muammar   in Libya and President Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe. In one instance,   knowingly invested in a Libyan development project in which some members of the Qaddafi family had a financial interest. “Senior executives cannot turn a blind eye to the acts of their employees or agents when they became aware of suspicious transactions with   partners in foreign countries,” said Andrew Ceresney, director of the S. E. C. ’s division of enforcement. The settlement caps a nearly   investigation by the Justice Department, the S. E. C. and overseas financial regulators that last month ensnared the son of a former prime minister of Gabon. But it still leaves the door open for action against others who once worked for   prosecutors said. Michael L. Cohen, who led  ’s investments in Africa, is referred to in court filings without his name being used. Mr. Cohen left the firm in 2013. He was also an officer in Africa Management Ltd. a joint venture set up by   to secure African resource contracts. Mr. Cohen worked closely at   with a former associate, Vanja Baros, who is also referred to in court filings from prosecutors but is not named. A representative for Mr. Baros declined to comment on Thursday. Ronald G. White, Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, said his client had “an unblemished reputation built over the course of a career spent creating value for  ’s investors,” adding that he had “done nothing wrong. ” Mr. Frank also declined to comment. The settlement focuses attention on one of the biggest and   hedge funds and one of the few publicly traded firms in the opaque $3 trillion hedge fund universe. “This has been a deeply disappointing episode,” Mr. Och said in an emailed statement, adding: “This conduct is inconsistent with our core values and not representative of our hundreds of employees worldwide, who are dedicated to serving our clients with the utmost integrity. We have learned from this experience and taken significant steps to strengthen  . ” Between 2007 and 2011,   pushed ahead with deals even though some within the firm raised questions about whom it was dealing with in Africa, according to the government. The S. E. C. for instance, said in its administrative order that Mr. Och and Mr. Frank “were aware of corruption accusations” against one partner it was working with in Congo. But the S. E. C. added that neither Mr. Och nor Mr. Frank knew that bribes would be paid. In another instance, an unidentified employee at   emailed Mr. Och to describe an important meeting with Libyan officials, including one of Qaddafi’s sons, in Vienna in 2007. “Meetings are amazing,” the employee wrote. “They have 77 billion, half in cash and no idea who to give it to,” referring to the Libyan Investment Authority, the country’s   sovereign wealth fund. When Mr. Och later inquired about progress, the employee replied: “I thought you were against it so I haven’t pursued it,” adding that  ’s Libyan fixer wanted to follow up. “You O. K. with that?” the employee asked. Mr. Och replied, “I will be O. K. Will call you. ”   first disclosed the Justice Department’s investigation in 2014. Earlier this year, the firm said it was nearing a settlement with the government, setting aside $200 million for a penalty. In August, federal investigators arrested Samuel Mebiame, a Gabonese consultant and son of a former prime minister, on charges that he routinely paid bribes to officials to secure mineral concessions in Niger, Guinea and Chad on behalf of   and its partners in a joint venture called Africa Management Ltd. The joint venture was seen as a new source of returns for  . A global commodities boom was just starting to fade when the venture was created in 2008, but Africa Management Ltd. had big ambitions to acquire assets like exploratory mining and energy concessions. In a statement at the time, Mr. Och said, “We look forward to working together to grow our combined venture and create the leading investment management business in the region. ” One week before Mr. Mebiame’s arrest,   said it was setting aside another $200 million as a provision for a penalty. On Thursday,   executives  —   including Mr. Och  —   committed to put $400 million toward the penalty. The firm faces more challenges ahead. Investors have pulled more than $5. 5 billion out of the hedge fund this year. “It hurts  ’s reputation,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “The legal separation of a parent and its subsidiaries might be important in court, but for reputation it is the brand name that counts, and the brand name is in the headlines. ” As part of the settlement,   will hire an independent monitor. The criminal charges will be dismissed if the firm complies with the terms of the   agreement and does not violate any other laws over the next three years. For the    Mr. Och, the deal with the S. E. C. is an admission of a lack of control and oversight at his firm. Like many titans in the hedge fund industry, Mr. Och began his career at Goldman Sachs before going on to found his own firm in 1994 with a $100 million investment from the Ziff brothers, heirs to a magazine empire. For years a top earner in the hedge fund industry, his net worth is estimated to be $2. 7 billion, according to Forbes. He is part of a small group of financial elite who mingle at Manhattan society events, contribute to the same charities and gather at the exclusive World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland. And   once loomed large in the industry. Just over a decade after Mr. Och founded the firm, it became one of the first hedge fund firms to go public, in 2007. With more than $26 billion in assets under management at the time of its public listing,   quickly grew to manage as much as $48 billion last year. According to the firm’s revolving credit facility  —   terms under which the firm can draw from loans  —   if its assets under management drop below $22 billion for more than two consecutive quarters,   could be declared in default.   was charged with four counts of bribery, but the charges will ultimately be dismissed if the firm complies with the terms of the agreement. The penalty that   faces is not the biggest faced by a hedge for breaking the law. Other hedge funds that have faced criminal charges, like Steven A. Cohen’s SAC Capital, have been forced to wind down their hedge funds. Mr. Cohen’s SAC paid $1. 2 billion to federal prosecutors as part of an insider trading guilty plea. Prosecutors and the S. E. C. filed hundreds of pages of documents. At a hearing Thursday afternoon, Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn, noted the extensive nature of the investigation, saying: “I would have you read the charges, but I have dinner plans at 8 p. m. ”",0
20191,20191,"U.S. Funding for Fighting Zika Virus Is Nearly Spent, C.D.C. Says - The New York Times",Sabrina Tavernise,"WASHINGTON  —   The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday that federal funds to fight the Zika virus were nearly exhausted, and that if Congress did not replenish them soon, there would be no money to fight a new outbreak. As of Friday, the C. D. C. had spent $194 million of the $222 million it was allocated to fight the virus, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the agency. Congress left for its summer recess without approving additional funding. Now that the virus is actively circulating in Florida, Dr. Frieden is pressing his case for funding with new urgency. On Tuesday, Florida officials announced three new Zika cases in   County. One was in Miami Beach, where the virus is already circulating. The state is trying to determine where the other two infections occurred. The agency has sent about $35 million to Florida, much of which has already been spent, largely on killing mosquitoes. But if Florida has another cluster of Zika cases, or if one surfaced in another state, the agency would not be able to send emergency funds, Dr. Frieden said. “The cupboard is bare, there’s no way to provide that,” Dr. Frieden said at a briefing with health reporters in Washington. Don Stewart, deputy chief of staff to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said Republicans in the Senate have scheduled a vote on a $1. 1 billion Zika package next Tuesday, when Congress comes back into session. But Democrats have been blocking consideration of the Republican package because it would exclude Planned Parenthood from the list of providers that get new funding for contraception to combat spread of the virus, which can be sexually transmitted. The issue of funding is urgent, public health experts say, because the Gulf Coast, where the Zika mosquito mostly lives, is only about halfway through peak mosquito season (it will not start to taper off until October) and the chances that the virus could start circulating in Houston or New Orleans are relatively high. The Zika virus causes only a mild illness in most people, but it can be devastating to the developing fetuses of pregnant women who are infected  —   causing brains to stop developing and infants’ skulls to collapse. There have been 16 infants born in the continental United States with what appears to be the   condition called microcephaly, Dr. Frieden said, and those numbers are likely to grow. As of Aug. 11, the C. D. C. was tracking 1, 200 pregnant women who have had   Zika infections. That was up from 750 cases on July 11. The shortfall of funding comes as officials are reporting surprising success with mosquito control in Florida. Aerial spraying over the Miami neighborhood with the locally transmitted cases in the continental United States has been highly effective, Dr. Frieden said. The success seems to have come from combining sprays that kill adult mosquitoes with sprays that kill larvae. (Adult sprays on their own were not as effective.) The outcome goes against conventional wisdom that aerial spraying does not work against the Aedes aegypti mosquito, the type that carries Zika. “What we’ve seen is very dramatic reduction in mosquito populations there,” Dr. Frieden said. He said the area was about halfway through the   period after which it will be cleared of the virus if no new cases emerge. Should funding not materialize, critical programs could be cut, Dr. Frieden said. For example, Puerto Rico, a territory with the largest number of Zika cases in the United States  —   more than 8, 700 at last count  —   has no mosquito control agency, and the C. D. C. had requested funding to start building one. Some funds were included in the $222 million the agency received, but not nearly enough. “We are not able to get a good running start on it,” Dr. Frieden said. Congress has been feuding over Zika funding since February, when President Obama made a $1. 9 billion request for emergency spending to fight the virus. Republicans balked, and eventually put forth their $1. 1 billion plan. With funding dwindling, the Obama administration recently shifted $81 million away from biomedical research and antipoverty and health care programs, to keep the lights on in the development of a Zika vaccine. One option could be for lawmakers to include money for Zika in the larger stopgap funding measure to keep the government running that Congress must begin working on next week. It is an open question whether Republicans and Democrats could agree on a compromise amount, but the growing number of Zika cases in Florida lends a new urgency to the matter. “If they don’t have money left in their grants, we don’t have money left, either,” Dr. Frieden said of states and their   funds.",0

20194,20194,Coincidence? Massive Solar Event Scheduled for Election Night… And Potential Impending Disaster,Mac Slavo,"
This article was written by Melissa Dykes and originally published at The Daily Sheeple . 
Editor’s Comment: Time and again, we have seen those in power planning to use an EMP or massive solar flare as a pretext for total unrest, a collapse of the electric grid and the institution of martial law. 
With so much at stake in the election, and more uncertainty than ever, are we about to witness the grandest wild card factor ever to enter U.S. politics? Is is possible that election results could be suspended as a result of a total meltdown of the electric grid, and the likely destruction/unreliability of electronic voting machines in every state? 
There’s no way to predict what may actually occur, but there is no way to look away from this potentially deadly scenario either. Just why did Obama prepare for this exact scenario? Though this one is kind of “out there,” it doesn’t change the real possibility that the feds may just be poised to take more power than ever before in history. This is truly eerie… 
Just Weeks After Obama’s Executive Order on Catastrophic Space Weather Events, a Coronal Mass Ejection Is Set to Hit on Election Day 
by Melissa Dykes
This has already been the craziest election in the history of the country, with the most overt corruption and fraud the American people have likely ever seen.
Now, on top of everything else that’s scheduled to go down tomorrow, it is being projected that a powerful coronal mass ejection (CME) is set to hit Earth tomorrow, and not just hit earth but a direct hit is in our forecast.
According to Space Weather Live , “A coronal mass ejection (or CME) is a giant cloud of solar plasma drenched with magnetic field lines that are blown away from the Sun during strong, long-duration solar flares and filament eruptions.” 
What this means is the very real potential for strong geomagnetic storms here on Earth. Potential storms from CMEs like this have been known to cause everything from lost satellite control to radio and television interference to power grid disruption and failure.
For example, in March 1989 , a powerful CME caused strong variations in the Earth’s magnetic field which tripped circuit breakers in Québec’s power grid, causing a massive blackout.
What makes this timing even more unsettling is the fact that just weeks ago, Obama signed a brand new executive order on October 13, 2016 specifically regarding Department of Energy, Department of Defense, and Homeland Security coordination in handling “space weather events” as reported by Mac Slavo over at SHTFplan.com :
Via WhiteHouse.Gov 
Executive Order — Coordinating Efforts to Prepare the Nation for Space Weather Events 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to prepare the Nation for space weather events , it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Policy. Space weather events, in the form of solar flares, solar energetic particles, and geomagnetic disturbances, occur regularly, some with measurable effects on critical infrastructure systems and technologies, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), satellite operations and communication, aviation, and the electrical power grid. Extreme space weather events — those that could significantly degrade critical infrastructure — could disable large portions of the electrical power grid, resulting in cascading failures that would affect key services such as water supply, healthcare, and transportation . Space weather has the potential to simultaneously affect and disrupt health and safety across entire continents. Successfully preparing for space weather events is an all-of-nation endeavor that requires partnerships across governments, emergency managers, academia, the media, the insurance industry, non-profits, and the private sector.
What are the odds??? 
It’s not like CMEs and solar flares are anything new… so why all of a sudden are they saying we need to, “speed the creation of a space-weather-ready Nation” right before it comes out that just a geomagnetic disturbance might happen on election day?
Add to that the fact that recently Homeland Security was also talking about taking over the elections as a matter of national security…
Do they know something we don’t here? Either way, considering that most of our data on these things comes from government agencies, the timing definitely makes you wonder what shenanigans are going to get pulled tomorrow with our easily hacked electronic voting machines …
Can’t you just see the “confusion” that could be caused by intermittent power outages on election day, all blamed on the sun?

And no matter what, it’s always good to be prepared .

[The rallies, which were organized by the national security organization ACT! for America, attracted strong support in cities such as Phoenix, Chicago, Austin, Atlanta, New York, Boston, and Seattle.  Sharia is the law of Islam, which governs how Muslims pray, eat, establish families, and all aspects of a Muslim’s life. The rules of sharia come from Quranic commandments and the hadiths, a collection of sayings of Muhammad. Sharia significantly restricts the freedom of women and allows for extreme punishments for violations such as adultery, blasphemy, and apostasy. Sharia is the basis of laws in Islamic countries, both Sunni and Shia. A press release from the ACT! for America website reads: This is a march against Sharia law and for human rights. Our nation is built on the freedom of religion  —   a pillar of our democracy  —   which we must always respect, protect, and honor. However many aspects of Sharia law run contrary to basic human rights and are completely incompatible with our laws and our democratic values.

More than two dozen people were injured at festivities in Dortmund, some seriously.

20198,20198,Architecture is More Than a Clever Arrangement of Bricks: This Man Transforms it Into a Healing Process,Alexa Erickson,"Architecture means many things to many people: It’s a form of creative expression, a tool for meticulous construction, a craft, a profession. In short, it’s much more than just perfectly placing bricks to form a building.
In this Ted Talk , Michael Murphy discusses how his father’s brush with death ultimately opened the doors to his own life path of architecture, but not just as a profession, and not just as a creative expression.
When designing, Murphy and his team go beyond the blueprint, considering things like how like airflow and light can produce both a healthy community and gorgeous structures.
He shows us his projects in countries like Rwanda and Haiti, and covers his plan for creating The Memorial to Peace and Justice, which mainly aims to heal hearts in the American South.
“ Why was it that the best architects, the greatest architecture — a ll beautiful and visionary and innovative — is also so rare, and seems to serve so very few? And more to the point: With all of this creative talent, what more could we do?” Murphy poses in his talk. 
He broke into the very soul of his work when he came to the realization that buildings are actually making people sicker.
“ In this hospital in South Africa, patients that came in with, say, a broken leg, to wait in this unventilated hallway, walked out with a multidrug-resistant strand of tuberculosis. Simple designs for infection control had not been thought about, and people had died because of it.” 
With the revelation that hospitals are making patients sicker, he thought of designing one that flips the hallways on the outside, allowing people to walk in the exterior. “ If mechanical systems rarely work, what if we could design a hospital that could breathe through natural ventilation, and meanwhile reduce its environmental footprint?” he said. 
He then discussed the incredible community aspect of following through with his healing niche in the architecture world.
“ We worked with Bruce Nizeye, a brilliant engineer, and he thought about construction differently than I had been taught in school. When we had to excavate this enormous hilltop and a bulldozer was expensive and hard to get to site, Bruce suggested doing it by hand, using a method in Rwanda called “Ubudehe,” which means “community works for the community.” Hundreds of people came with shovels and hoes, and we excavated that hill in half the time and half the cost of that bulldozer. Instead of importing furniture, Bruce started a guild, and he brought in master carpenters to train others in how to make furniture by hand. And on this job site, 15 years after the Rwandan genocide, Bruce insisted that we bring on labor from all backgrounds, and that half of them be women. “ 
Ultimately, the healing journey became twofold, as it was both the process of building to heal as well as allowing an entire community to heal.
“We call this the locally fabricated way of building, or ‘lo-fab,’ and it has four pillars: hire locally, source regionally, train where you can and most importantly, think about every design decision as an opportunity to invest in the dignity of the places where you serve. Think of it like the local food movement, but for architecture. And we’re convinced that this way of building can be replicated across the world, and change the way we talk about and evaluate architecture,” he explained. 
In his talk, Murphy reveals how he learned that architecture is more than what it seems. It “can be a transformative engine for change.”
Watch the full talk below. Perhaps it will show you how your work can be more than what it seems, too.

20201,20201,Comment on “This is My Second One” — Virginia Cop Caught Bragging About Killing Two Unarmed People by Jamieson,Jamieson,"Home / Badge Abuse / “This is My Second One”— Virginia Cop Caught Bragging About Killing Two Unarmed People “This is My Second One”— Virginia Cop Caught Bragging About Killing Two Unarmed People Claire Bernish July 27, 2016 7 Comments 
A former Virginia police officer and U.S. Navy veteran, whose trial for murder begins this week, told a witness, “this is my second one,” after killing an unarmed 18-year-old black man in April 2015. 
While unclear whether or not the jarring statement amounted to a boast, the camera on ex-Portsmouth Officer Stephen Rankin’s Taser recorded him saying this to a Walmart employee mere seconds after he fatally shot unarmed teen and alleged shoplifter William Chapman in the store’s parking lot in April 2015. 
Rankin had, indeed, killed another unarmed man, Kirill Denyakin — under circumstances similarly and sufficiently questionable to earn three years’ administrative leave — just four years prior to the shooting for which he now stands accused of first-degree murder. 
During the final pretrial hearing on Tuesday, the Guardian reported , Rankin’s lead defense attorney, James Broccoletti, argued the former officer’s “statement is not probative of anything,” in an unsuccessful attempt to have it suppressed. 
Prosecutors countered to Judge Johnny E. Morrison they should not have to “sanitize the evidence” surrounding the fatal shooting. 
“The defendant made the comment, not just in the presence and earshot of a witness, but to the witness,” argued Commonwealth’s Attorney Stephanie N. Morales , who heads the case against Rankin. 
Although Morrison had previously disallowed direct statements to jurors concerning Rankin’s fatal shooting of Denyakin, as the Guardian noted , it now appears the officer’s prior use of deadly force will play an albeit limited role in the prosecution’s case. 
Troubling details about the killing of unarmed 26-year-old Kazakhstani cook, Kirill Denyakin, on April 23, 2011, would seem to suggest a glib tone in the officer’s later statement to the Walmart employee. 
Rankin responded to a call about Denyakin drunkenly pounding on the door of a residence where he had been staying with friends. Alleging the cook reached for his waistband and then charged toward him, Rankin shot Denyakin 11 times in the chest and limbs, as The Free Thought Project reported . No weapons were recovered on Denyakin’s body or at the scene — but when the man’s family filed a $22 million civil suit against the officer, the situation took a dark turn. 
Defending his use of deadly force, Rankin — who had chosen a photograph of a dead Serb who had been lynched by the Nazis in 1943 as his Facebook profile picture — took to a local newspaper’s website, posting roughly 250 comments derisively attacking Denyakin’s character and insulting his family’s attempt to seek compensation, writing : 
“22 mil won’t buy your boy back … let alone a habitual drunk working as a hotel cook.” 
Weeks prior to that deadly interaction, one of the officer’s supervisors cautioned senior commanders Rankin was “dangerous” and likely to harm someone. Further revelations included Facebook posts in which the cop referred to his firearms case as “Rankin’s box of vengeance.” 
A grand jury refused to indict Rankin for the Denyakin’s killing — and though the department placed him on administrative leave for nearly three years, it took just over a year after his return to active duty for Rankin to fatally shoot Chapman under circumstances suspicious enough to now stand accused of murder. 
On the morning of April 22, 2015, Portsmouth Walmart employees summoned police to report a shoplifter. Rankin responded and confronted 18-year-old Chapman in the store’s parking lot. Several witnesses reported seeing Rankin attempting to handcuff the teen, but their observations of what happened next differ to some degree. 
Two construction workers said Chapman broke free from the officer, knocking his Taser to the ground; but, in speaking to separate reporters afterward, one described the man “ whaling on ” the officer, the other noted the pair’s subsequent interaction was a “ tussle ” in which the teen had not been close enough to physically strike Rankin. 
In a report , pathologists noted Rankin would have been at least 30 inches away from Chapman when he was shot, and the medical examiner did not find gunpowder burns or residue suggestive of a point-blank or near point-blank shooting. No stolen items were listed among the victim’s personal effects. 
Further, body cam footage recorded Rankin holding his Taser, but abruptly and perhaps conveniently, if not outright suspiciously, stopped for the 15 seconds surrounding the shooting — only to pick up after the deadly interaction, with the Taser on the ground. 
Chapman’s family’s attorney, Jon Babineau, recounting what he was told for Pilot Online , said in December, “The video was operational up until just before the shooting, and then it was not operational for about 15 seconds,” though an unnamed source told him the gap had been caused by a “power source issue” and did not necessarily believe the tape had been edited. 
In September 2015, a grand jury indicted Rankin for murder and the illegal use of a firearm. 
Rankin has since been terminated from the Portsmouth force and continues to maintain his innocence. 
Jury selection for the murder trial is slated to begin this morning. Share Google + Fred Ziffel 
Anytime the calculated death of a human being is forced by another knowing these actions are not ABSOLUTELY necessary and there was no other immediate threat to life, the act of taking or ending said life becomes murder. Who the perpetrator is, or what his/her occupational profession is, is totally irrelevant. Murder is not justifiable. 
I hope they prosecute this vigorously and relentlessly. Bill Allyn 
Justice System Reform List America has a serious, institutionalized, systemic law enforcement problem. Over the last 4 decades, our law enforcement has become increasingly militarized, putting every citizen at risk of being shot and killed for nothing more than reaching for their wallet, as instructed, or less. This may increase safety for police officers (debatable, in the long run), but at the expense of making American citizens far less safe, which is the exact opposite of the goals of law enforcement. We need to create systems that bring back accountability within every level of the justice system. Nationally, we need to: 1. Create citizen oversight committees with powers of subpoena and prosecutorial discretion for every law enforcement agency in the country. A special independent prosecutor must be assigned immediately for officer-involved shootings. Committee members should be randomly selected and replaced often, like grand jurors, to avoid corruption. 2. Require law enforcement officers to be personally insured to protect taxpayers from lawsuits. Too risky for insurance? No insurance, no badge. Insurance could be partially publicly subsidized. 3. Require every law enforcement officer to wear a camera. No camera, no gun. Also, implement GPS tracking on all police cars and cameras. 4. Require yearly psyche tests to screen out potentially abusive officers. 5. Require random drug and steroid tests. 6. All police agencies must keep a database of every officer-caused civilian injury, shooting or killing, and that data must be periodically transmitted to a third-party, non-biased national database. 7. Any officer involved in a shooting must be alcohol and drug tested immediately. 8. Officers should be made aware of studies on abuse of power, such as the Stanford Prison Experiment and the Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures. Ensure there are clear policies on use of force. 9. More training to deal with mentally ill, or a mental illness crisis unit. More training and encouragement to use peacemaking, conflict resolution, and de-escalation skills. Increase educational requirements, focusing on psychology, sociology, and social work. 10. Create a special number (third party, independent of police) to report police brutality. Victims of police brutality and the families of police shootings should immediately be appointed an attorney to represent their position/case. 11. Create national database of abusive officers, so they don’t just get hired elsewhere. 12. Reverse militarization of police forces. Take away military weapons, APC’s, uniforms, and especially the attitude. Police officers are civilians, not a branch of the military. Require at least 5 years between active duty military and civilian police employment. Keep SWAT/military weapons and equipment under lock and key only to be used in genuine emergencies. Quit viewing the community you police as a “war zone”. 13. Prohibit television shows that glorify bad, illegal, or unconstitutional policing, such as “Cops”. Glorifying these behaviors creates a dangerous situation for American citizens and should not be tolerated. 14. Increase community outreach. Hire officers from the community. Officers need to be more in touch with the people they are sworn to protect. 15. End no-knock raids. It is perfectly legal for a home owner to respond to a break in with gun in hand, which gets them killed when the police are the intruders. This makes it unreasonably dangerous on citizens, especially when cops often go to the wrong address. 16. Reform forfeiture laws to protect citizens’ property rights and due process. No forfeiture proceedings until after conviction. All forfeiture proceeds go directly to the victims of police brutality and the families of police shootings. 17. End drug prohibition/war on drugs. Use harm reduction strategies. 18. End private prison industry. 19. Create a national organization dedicated to these ideals. Jamieson

20203,20203,Diary of a Cruise Season - The New York Times,Vanessa Friedman,"This season is a mess. The spring 2017 men’s wear shows are almost over, for goodness sake, and women’s wear is still in the middle of cruise  . “Cruise?” you ask. “Huh?” Exactly. Cruise  —   a. k. a. prespring, a. k. a. resort  —   are the clothes that arrive in November and stay on shelves through March and sometimes even April. The shows began May 3 with Chanel, an extravaganza in Havana that included 86 looks, some tourism and some controversy, and they extend through next month  —   yes, into the couture fall   season. There is no cohesion to the cruise collections. They include   clothes as well as fur   (Chanel, Vuitton, Dior, Gucci) as well as small presentations some brands (Chanel, among others) that want to publicize and some (Proenza Schouler, Céline) that don’t, at least until it hits stores. So I gave up trying to make sense of it. Instead, I thought I’d take you along for what is necessarily a somewhat arbitrary ride. After all, in the end we each pack our own bags. May 11   which I watched via livestream (the concept of traveling to an exotic destination for a single show being the kind of seduction that best serves clients, not critics) the emails are starting to pile up, listing presentations in   corners of New York. I feel like Tippi Hedren being swarmed by the birds. May 19 Today is Oscar de la Renta day. The label does a series of minishows in its showroom with the creative director Peter Copping, in front of 20 to 30 people at a time. This season, there were 33 looks, which Mr. Copping says were inspired by the idea of “patchwork,” translated through a very luxe lens. Think of baby florals and tweeds and jacquards lace and feathers. That contrast, between a casual idea and an elaborate expression, pretty much summed up the mood of the collection: classic (and classy) de la Rentaisms with the stuffing taken out. May 23 Trying to keep track of who is doing what, I email Burberry, which has had small presentations in the past. The company says it is not doing anything this year because it is jettisoning the idea of seasons altogether and has rejiggered its schedule to show men’s wear and women’s wear together in September and sell the clothes immediately after it shows them. Stella McCartney, who used to be famous for her cruise   has decided to show the collection in November in London, before it goes on sale. Mary Katrantzou is taking her collection on the road to New York, but they are not allowing me to tell you about the clothes before they are in stores on pain of Great Brand Excommunication. (Spoiler: they are cheerful.) Diane von Furstenberg’s office calls to tell me that because it just hired Jonathan Saunders as its first chief creative officer, it isn’t having a resort presentation, because he won’t have had a chance to put his stamp on the collection. May 28 This is the week of the  . Today, Louis Vuitton is in Rio Zika and political unrest be damned! The brand rules the social media waves. On May 31 and June 2, Dior and Gucci hold their shows in Britain (in Blenheim Palace and Westminster Abbey, respectively). I watch them all on my computer and try to run the numbers on what it costs to bring an entire fashion show to an exotic locale. I am boggled. The brands say it is worth it. June 6 Back in New York, Narciso Rodriguez is at 9:30 a. m.: Lexington and 16th Street. He is interested in “splicing”  —   i. e. cutting in ever more deceptively simple, but actually highly complicated, ways. See, for example, a   gown in heavy silk satin with the weft running in two different directions, so some of the fabric looks glossy and other bits matte. If Veronica Lake had a Modernist moment, she’d be in heaven. Or this dress. Across town on 11th Avenue, some Brits have touched down: Christopher Kane (  pansies, including big lace mitochondrial petal “blobs” inset randomly on iridescent pleated skirts) and Peter Pilotto (haute peasant, with technical taffeta and Peruvian rug embroidery). June 7 “Calling this ‘cruise’ is an error. It should be called ‘destination. ’” Michael Kors is doing his version of    —   the cruise collection explanation monologue. The destinations he has in mind? “Gstaad, Mustique, Palm Beach, Palm Springs or destination ‘God forbid it’s snowing and I need a new wool coat. ’” Some more of his morsels: “A fox wellie is the kind of basic boot every girl needs. ” “We don’t sell bathing suits people swim in. These are bathing suits people wear in party situations. It’s the new cocktail dress. ” He is feeling graphics, especially polka dots and grommets. “How do you cut through the winter doldrums? Graphic is the way to go. ” Marc Jacobs, fresh from his CFDA women’s wear designer of the year award, thinks 1980s MTV is the way to go, in 54 superbright,   looks. (Can this be a coincidence? 54 looks? Studio 54?) The show was supposed to start at 9 a. m. sharp, but during the awards ceremony the night before, we kept getting emailed updates: maybe 9:30, actually 10. Guess you can do that when you win one for the sixth time. At Suno, Erin Beatty and Max Osterweis went on a trip around Africa with a nod to Edwardiana via plaid linen and eyelet, denim and shirting overembroidered with florals, big    ruffles paired with generous trousers and full skirts. At Coach, Stuart Vevers was feeling Felix the Cat (the brand made a deal with DreamWorks to use the image) adding him to the rest of the label’s building blocks: prairie dresses, motorcycle jackets, shearling and dinosaurs, used this time instead of Izod alligators on cardigans. What’s up with that? “It’s actually not that ” Mr. Vevers said. “I like that it’s kind of random. ” That’s the thing about cruise: Ask most designers what it is about and they say: “Clothes you wear. ” That sounds absurd, since all clothes are theoretically clothes you wear. But what they actually mean is: not clothes you pose in, clothes you depend on. Think of it that way. Public School is not actually doing cruise: It is combining men’s and women’s wear, and spring and   respectively. It is making a statement about the fashion system and the political system. “We need leaders” is   on a wall at the end of the show. The wall is apparently supposed to represent “false monuments. ” The show is presumably supposed to represent the future, or the clothes of the rebelling masses. Mostly it feels confused, though the pieces themselves were pretty simple: dystopian tailoring and designer anoraks, accessorized with slashes and asymmetry, accented with   yellow and a melting flower photo print. June 9: “It’s good not to always do something new,” says Joseph Altuzarra, in his studio during his  . “Sometimes you want to speak a language that you’ve already established. ” His vernacular has to do with pencil skirts,   plaid shirtdresses, trompe l’oeil lingerie knits, pastel lace and ribbed stretch cardigans laced with faux leather. “It’s easier to clean that way,” he says. June 13: It’s the Monday after the Friday before, which is to say: after the Moschino show in Los Angeles, which was a combined  ’s wear show (with tickets sold to the public for up to $400, list price) along with models (Miranda Kerr, Chanel Iman) celebrities (Katy Perry, Caitlyn Jenner) and 1960s cartoon psychedelia (miniskirts, mirror mosaics, flower power and animal print). Now Valentino is in the former Warhol Factory on Union Square. Like Chanel, it is having a Cuba moment, though its Cuba is a Cuba of the mind. The designers Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli were thinking about the way Cuba is frozen in the imagination, which led them to their own past, which led them to red, a nod to the favorite color of the label’s founder, but in washed brocade and silk to give the clothes the soft focus of age, plus Tropicana bomber jackets and skirts and dresses encrusted in wooden   and, well, a lot more. The Factory is jammed with jersey and lace and camouflage and khaki. The work is eye boggling. Designers spend a lot of time complaining these days about their lack of time, but these two seem exhilarated by it. Rag  Bone is in its studio in the meatpacking district. Marcus Wainwright, the     is there, waxing laconic on the stripy knits, tuxedo track pants, airy   and shearlings that are the label’s signatures. David Neville, the   executive, is not there. This doesn’t seem odd, since Marcus is in charge of the design studio. But when they announce two days later that Mr. Neville is leaving the company, it suddenly seems full of portent. June 16 Carolina Herrera, in her 35th year in business, is living the fairy tale. Her resort collection is an enchanting confection of sparkling tulle cocktail and evening gowns in shades from nude to graphic     —   plus a few denim numbers for day and a terrific pair of wide peach taffeta trousers to wear with a white cashmere sweater striped in sequins. Coincidentally, or probably not, Mrs. Herrera has a new design team  —   Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim of Monse  —   and they did even   trousers in their own collection, as well as khaki coat dresses and bandanna frocks twisted, pulled and otherwise chopped up in unexpected angles. In any case, Mrs. Herrera isn’t around to discuss her role as resort’s fairy godmother because she’s at a spa in Austria with her husband. Too bad. I could have used a magic wand to transport me to different shores: On June 29, Creatures of the Wind, based in New York, is having a resort show at Spencer House in London. July 3 I know we haven’t actually gotten here yet in real time, but it’s already on my calendar: Miu Miu is unveiling its cruise line in Paris with a   event. Later this week, Céline will be showing its line. I can see it, though no pictures will be released until it goes into stores in November. Ditto Proenza Schouler and Chloé. But at that point I’ll be cycling back in fashion time (though forward in real time) to fall 2016, with couture. Enough is enough. I know this is a time of unpredictable weather patterns, but it seems to me that when a new season begins, it’s time for the old one to end.",0
20204,20204,Only Geniuses & Schizophrenics Can Pass This 3 Question Quiz! - David Avocado Wolfe - DavidWolfe.com,nan,"0 - items Only Geniuses & Schizophrenics Can Pass This 3 Question Quiz! 
Many neuroscientists estimate that as much as 98% of all brain activity is unconscious. Just think about that for a second – 98%. 
All that unconscious activity is influenced heavily by the world around its subconscious cues. To demonstrate that, we’re going to call on a super cool quiz. The premise is simple; only geniuses and schizophrenics can answer the following three questions. Which one are you? Continue to find out! 
There are no hints! You either know it or you don’t! 
The test you’ve just done relies on what researchers call the ‘contraposition method.’ This method tests the extent of a person’s awareness and brain processing power. It’s a super complicated method with tons of ‘moving parts,’ so to speak, but here’s what you need to know for the purpose of this article: There are objects which one can reasonably say are unrelated. Most people would assume, for example, that a race car and a hurricane have very little connection. A genius who thinks outside of the box, however, would deduce some sort of connection. A schizophrenic patient would also deduce a connection because of the way the illness makes people see non-existent connections in just about everything. In other words, if the quiz in this article left you scratching your head, you’re normal. If not, one of two things is true – you’re brilliant, or you have schizophrenia. 
Don’t worry, I won’t leave you guessing. Here are some facts that will help you figure out which one you are: Geniuses will have taken their time to think before blurting a response. Did you get the answers right? What do you think – are you a schizophrenic or a genius? As far as the schizophrenia angle goes, this post is not a diagnostic tool. It can get you thinking about schizophrenia and, if you have concerns, you can see a psychiatrist for a proper evaluation.

20205,20205,Report: Colin Kaepernick to Stand for National Anthem in 2017 - Breitbart,Trent Baker,"After refusing to stand for the national anthem in 2016, activist and quarterback Colin Kaepernick now plans to stand in 2017, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reports. [Kaepernick said from the beginning that he would kneel until he saw a significant change, but that change seems to be when he no longer has a gig in the NFL.  The polarizing quarterback opted out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers this week and will officially be a free agent next week. Per ESPN’s Schefter, Kaepernick is ending the protest because he does not want to “detract from the positive change that he believes has been created,” but the timing of the announcement makes it obvious that the quarterback wants to separate himself from the distraction and controversy.

20206,20206,ObamaCare on the Brink,Charles Scaliger,"As was predicted by opponents from the start, ObamaCare has begun to implode, owing to high costs brought on by government planners. Questions remain: Why, and what next? 

On Monday, October 3, former President Bill Clinton, in a series of unexpected and perhaps unscripted comments while stumping on behalf of his wife’s presidential campaign in Flint, Michigan, took the political world by surprise when he singled out Obama­Care for scathing criticism. “You’ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden, 25 million more people have health care, and then the people who are out there busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half and it’s the craziest thing in the world,” Clinton told a crowd of supporters. 
He added that “the current system works fine if you’re eligible for Medicaid, if you’re a lower-income working person, if you’re already on Medicare or if you get enough subsidies on a modest income that you can afford your health care.” 
But overall, Clinton concluded, Obama­Care is hurting the very people it was intended to help, pointing out that “the people getting killed in this deal are the small-business people and individuals who make just a little bit too much to get any of these subsidies.” 
During Bill Clinton’s own presidency a generation ago, Hillary Clinton was put in charge of creating a system of socialized medicine (so-called Hillarycare), an effort that met with political failure. The Clintons have long been ardent public supporters of socialized medicine (and socialism in general). What would prompt Bill Clinton to attack ObamaCare during a heated presidential campaign? Have the failings of Obama’s disastrous experiment in socialized medicine become so obvious that even Democrats now want to distance themselves from it? 
In a word, yes. Since its full phase-in earlier in 2016, the Affordable Care Act has — as its many detractors have been predicting for years — inflicted critical damage on an already creaky healthcare system and ruined healthcare coverage for tens of millions of Americans. As Clinton noted correctly, the middle class, students, and small-business owners and their employees have borne the brunt of the damage, although no one but the few who can afford to pay out of pocket for healthcare have been unaffected by ObamaCare. Premiums have skyrocketed alongside deductibles and copays, while President Obama’s most quotable promise — that Americans who liked their pre-Obama­Care health coverage could keep it — has been discarded, as millions promptly lost their coverage or endured deep cuts in benefits and soaring costs with their existing coverage. In a word, ObamaCare has been a scourge on the already troubled American economy, a monumental political and economic mistake that has been a major contributor to our continuing economic malaise, more than eight years after the onset of the Great Recession. 
Sticker Shock 
One of the concerns that ObamaCare was supposed to address was rising healthcare premiums, which had outpaced wage increases for years. During the five-year period from 2004 to 2009, for example, healthcare premiums rose an average of 30 percent, while wages increased by only 12.2 percent. Figures such as these buoyed President Obama and other supporters of socialized medicine, and were a crucial factor leading to the passage of ObamaCare in 2010. Yet in the first year after ObamaCare’s enactment, premium costs soared by an additional 9.4 percent, and by 2014, the increase over five years was a whopping additional 28 percent, while wages only grew by 7.8 percent during that same period. While some of the depressed wages were (and are) certainly attributable to the Great Recession and its seemingly never-ending aftermath, it has become embarrassingly clear that Obama­Care has done nothing to halt the rise in healthcare premium costs. 
With open enrollment in ObamaCare slated to begin in November, another, politically far more damaging consequence has dominated the news in recent days: the soaring cost of ObamaCare premiums in many states. During the last week in October, the election season was roiled by news that the price of ObamaCare premiums will rise on average 25 percent in 2017, with many areas experiencing significantly greater price hikes. Arizona, which will be among the hardest-hit states, will experience a whopping 116 percent increase in its second-cheapest “silver plan,” for which a hypothetical 27-year-old paying $196 per month in 2016 will be paying $422 in 2017. The Obama administration has tried to downplay this latest round of healthcare sticker shock, with glib assurances that eight out of 10 ObamaCare beneficiaries will qualify for subsidies under the terms of the now-ironically named Affordable Care Act. Aviva Aron-Dine of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rushed to assure ObamaCare customers that the government will cover the difference for most of them: Issuers were pricing for a completely new market, one where they could no longer exclude those with the most serious health needs; many set prices that turned out to be too low.... Not only do tax credits bring down the cost of coverage, they adjust dollar for dollar with the cost of the benchmark plan in your area. So even if the cost of benchmark coverage goes up, most consumers will not have to pay more. 
In other words, the market got pricing wrong at the outset, but now the government, in its omniscience, will fix everything. HHS has indicated that our hypothetical young Arizonan in a silver plan will qualify for government subsidies of about $280 per month — if his annual income is $25,000 or so. If he makes more than $30,000, the subsidy will be much less. Left unsaid in all the posturing and spin is how the government is going to pay for all the new healthcare subsidies that the disastrous rise in premium costs has made necessary. The answer, of course, will ultimately be higher taxes, fees, and public debt, coupled with further contractions of benefits. 
Another development unanticipated by the Obama administration has been the veritable stampede of healthcare providers and insurers out of ObamaCare. As early as 2013, insurance company Aetna announced that it was opting out of ObamaCare in a number of states, including Connecticut (where the corporation is headquartered), California, Georgia, and Maryland. Other major insurers, such as Blue Cross and United Health Group, have also pulled out of healthcare exchanges in California and elsewhere as the health insurance market continues to contract under centralized control. Meanwhile, many of the nation’s top hospitals and clinics are either opting out of ObamaCare or being very selective in the policies for which they will accept coverage. With the beginning of open enrollment in November, many markets, such as Philadelphia, will be left with only one or two insurance providers participating in ObamaCare, leaving consumers little or no choice. On average, the number of options available to customers will decline by about a third, with competition declining in all but four states that participate in Healthcare.gov’s exchange. Hard-beset Arizona is a fairly typical example of the dizzying decline of healthcare options: In the Grand Canyon State, the number of options available will fall from 65 in 2016 to just four in 2017. Overall, about 21 percent of customers seeking healthcare plans at Healthcare.gov will encounter only one option in 2017 — up from two percent in 2016. 
Meanwhile, health insurance plans nationwide are plagued by ballooning deductibles — the amount the insured must pay out of pocket for healthcare before insurance benefits kick in. Once a nominal amount, the post-ObamaCare deductible has rapidly morphed into a severe financial threat in and of itself. The average deductible for a typical “Bronze” plan under ObamaCare is now $5,629, while the average deductible for a “Silver” plan is $2,994. The lowest deductibles belong to the “Gold” plans, which average only $1,105 — but feature premiums too expensive for most Americans to pay. As Nathan Nascimento recently pointed out in the National Review : Paying $3,000 or $5,600 before their insurance kicks in simply isn’t an option for most families in times of emergency. A December 2015 survey by Bankrate.com found that 63 percent of Americans don’t have enough savings to cover an unexpected emergency-room visit costing $1,000. A recent report from the New York Times put it bluntly: Rising out-of-pocket costs have rendered many exchange plans “all but useless” for those already struggling to make ends meet. 
And participation in America’s Brave New World of healthcare isn’t optional; Obama­Care also levies hefty tax penalties on Americans without health insurance, and has anointed the IRS its collection and enforcement arm. The federal government has — so far — been tentative in enforcing the tax penalties for the uninsured. As Joseph Thorndike, a tax policy analyst, told the New York Times , “It is highly unusual for the federal government to use tax penalties to encourage affirmative behavior. That’s a hard sell.” Even so, tax penalties assessed by the IRS have been rising steadily, in an attempt to browbeat Americans into the system. Many Americans, however, have done the math and prefer, even four years into the ObamaCare abyss, to pay the annual penalty. One Atlanta business consultant in his early fifties told the Times that he was seriously considering dropping his ObamaCare premium, which is costing him $1,400 a month this year to cover his family of four. Next year, his premiums will go up by 60 percent, whereas the IRS penalty will only amount to two months’ worth of premiums. And his story is far from unique. Millions of Americans are prepared to take the risk of a major medical setback and pay a tax penalty of hundreds or even thousands of dollars rather than be saddled with enormously expensive monthly premiums that pay for policies with deductibles so high that only a catastrophic event would be covered at all. Some consumers who buy insurance on the exchanges still feel vulnerable. “Deductibles are so high,” observes the Times , “that the insurance seems useless. So some think that whether they send hundreds of dollars to the I.R.S. or thousands to an insurance company, they are essentially paying something for nothing.” 
For ObamaCare to even appear to work, it must be able to attract large numbers of healthy, young, low-risk subscribers — yet that is the opposite of what has taken place so far. A large percentage of Obama­Care subscribers are older and/or in poor health, precisely the customer base that would be most attracted to policies that, though expensive, are still preferable to the alternative of paying tens or hundreds of thousands annually for chronic illnesses and long-term disabilities. 
For those already insured via employer-based plans, rising premiums and deductibles alongside contracting benefits have become a fact of life. Healthcare providers and insurers, hard beset by ObamaCare’s many mandates, are trying to save money any way they can, which includes scaling back benefits for all payers. 
In a word, Americans now find themselves in a healthcare morass from which there appears to be no deliverance. If current projections are anywhere near the mark, Americans will soon be paying as much or more for government-run healthcare plans than they would have paid by choice before ObamaCare — except with the inefficiencies inherent to any government-run enterprise added on. Moreover, there is every indication that, sooner rather than later, in large swaths of America no insurance provider will participate in ObamaCare at all. 
Private to Public 
It wasn’t supposed to turn out this way. In reassuring voters of the need for his reforms, President Obama famously promised tens of millions of Americans already satisfied with their healthcare coverage that they would be able to keep their plans if they liked them. We were also assured by a mob of Democrats and their media mouthpieces that ObamaCare could be done cheaply and efficiently, and that it would solve chronic problems with portability, rising costs, and lack of access to quality healthcare for millions of Americans. 
Yet not everybody was convinced. All the way back in 1993, when Bill Clinton was attempting to pass sweeping healthcare reforms, humorist P. J. O’Rourke famously quipped to a gathering at the Cato Institute: “If you think health care is expensive now, wait until you see what it costs when it’s free.” As events turned out then, Hillary Clinton and her team of high-paid experts were unable to ram socialized medicine down America’s collective throat. But President Obama was able to enact the long-standing goal of government-run healthcare, and the results have been precisely what O’Rourke and many others on the Right had warned us to expect. Perhaps the only surprise has been the speed of the implosion, but few sober observers doubt that ObamaCare is in a death spiral, courtesy of the implacable laws of economics. 
The federal government’s meddling in the healthcare system began during the Second World War, an indirect consequence of wage controls imposed by the federal government. Companies were unable to offer competitive wages thanks to FDR’s wartime socialist measures, but when the War Labor Board exempted fringe benefits from the wage controls, companies began offering competitive healthcare insurance benefits instead. When the war ended, the wage controls were lifted, but the expectation of employer-provided healthcare remained. President Truman tried to pass a voluntary government healthcare program, but the politics of the day did not allow him to make any progress. Labor unions, which in general favored programs such as socialist medicine, opted instead to support measures requiring big companies to offer health benefits packages. By 1960, most large public and private employers offered health insurance, whose benefits typically extended to routine care. And not surprisingly, once average Americans were offered government and union-backed benefits packages that incentivized frequent trips to the doctor for checkups, minor colds and injuries, and a range of other elective procedures, prices began to rise with increasing demand. 
The ObamaCare crisis is but the latest installment in the slow-motion deterioration of the American healthcare system, a trend that began in the mid-’60s after the passage of Lyndon Johnson’s Social Security Amendments of 1965 (a major component of President Johnson’s “Great Society” initiative), which created Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare and Medicaid were the first major interventions in the healthcare sector by the federal government, and were the outcome of decades of pressure by the Left to emulate countries such as Great Britain in instituting socialized medicine. With the passage of these two massive new federal programs, healthcare costs began to rise precipitously, and have been rising ever since, with each new government healthcare “fix” introducing new distortions and disincentives into the healthcare markets. From 1960 to 2013, healthcare spending rose from $147 per person to $9,255 per person, with an average annual increase of 8.1 percent. Per capita income over the same period grew by an average of only 5.7 percent. More tellingly, during this same period there was a massive shift in responsibility for coverage of healthcare costs. In 1960, 77 percent of healthcare costs were covered by private sponsors such as households and businesses, with the other 23 percent covered by government (a surprisingly high percentage pre-Great Society, but these figures include all levels of government). By 2013, private sponsors covered only 57 percent, and government the remaining 43 percent. More specifically, the federal government’s share of healthcare spending rose from 11 percent to 26 percent. 
The figures tell an interesting story. Over the last 50 years, healthcare has morphed from a mostly private to a mostly government enterprise, in terms of where and how the money is being spent, and the history of healthcare legislation since 1965 is a litany of greater and greater federal government involvement in the healthcare sector. 
In 1973, Congress passed the Health Maintenance Organization Act, which mandated that companies with 25 or more employees offer federally certified HMO coverage. HMOs were envisaged as a way to streamline and contain already rising healthcare costs, by incentivizing preventive care and healthy lifestyle choices, among other things. But while they were billed as private organizations, their economics were always driven by the federal government, which from the beginning has exercised oversight of HMOs via the use of mandates requiring them to produce particular products. But healthcare costs continued to soar, averaging annual increases well above 10 percent throughout the ’70s. And the barrage of new federal regulations continued. 
The year 1986 saw the passage of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, whereby the federal government forced hospitals that accept Medicare payments to treat any individual seeking medical treatment, regardless of citizenship status or ability to pay. However, the government does not reimburse hospitals for this service, leaving the Emergency Medical Treatment requirements an unfunded mandate that hospitals must pay for by increasing costs elsewhere. 
In 1996, Congress passed the massive Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which protected health insurance for families and individuals who change jobs or become unemployed. By the late ’90s, such legislation was deemed necessary because healthcare costs had risen so high that one major medical procedure not covered by insurance — let alone treatment for chronic, pre-existing conditions that traditional insurance would not cover — would spell financial ruin for most. But those conditions — a healthcare sector in which those outside the system of employer-provided benefits risked a lifetime of debt for injuries sustained in a car accident, for example — were wholly a creation of government interference in the healthcare sector in the first place, by first incentivizing higher consumer demand than the free market once warranted, and then by systematically mandating a broader range of services, at lower cost, than healthcare providers could possibly provide without taxpayer subsidies or much higher prices for other services. 
In 2003, Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (shortened to MMA), the largest overhaul of Medicare since its inception. And MMA did not streamline Medicare or defund any part of its provisions. Instead, it massively expanded Medicare coverage to include prescription drugs — paid for, of course, by government subsidies. The cost of new prescription drugs had been shooting up, due mostly to more and more stringent FDA controls and government red tape hindering pharmaceutical R&D. But as it routinely does, government was only too happy to provide a solution (government-subsidized prescription drug coverage) for a government-created problem (exorbitant prices for newer prescription drugs). And the consequences have been predictable: Prescription drug prices continued to soar, driving Medicare costs to Icarian altitudes. 
Undeterred, the federal government continued its campaign to solve healthcare costs by creative legislation. The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act followed in 2005, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2009, before President Obama’s mammoth Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) ushered in a new era of truly socialized medicine in the United States in 2010. 
“Single Payer” 
But even the Affordable Care Act is not what left-wing radicals have been seeking for almost a century. The real goal is an innocuously named “single payer” system — in essence, a system in which the government pays for everybody’s healthcare, such as healthcare systems in Canada, Great Britain, and many other wealthy countries. Such a system converts healthcare into a wholly public enterprise — and gives the state total authority over matters of life and death, including abortion and euthanasia. Fully socialized medicine has always been near the top of every socialist’s wish list, because it gives the state full control over the health of its citizens. 
It has been suggested, with some plausibility, that ObamaCare was a ruse, programmed to fail so that Americans would more readily accept single-payer healthcare as a solution. Whether or not the spectacular failures of ObamaCare were anticipated by its creators, the Left is already touting a single-payer system as the solution. Robert Reich, ultra-liberal Harvard professor and secretary of labor under President Clinton, is strongly supportive of a single-payer system. In an August article entitled “Why a Single-Payer Health Care System Is Inevitable,” Reich caricatured the insurance industry, insisting that “the problem isn’t Obamacare per se. It lies in the structure of the private markets for health insurance — which creates powerful incentives to avoid sick people and attract healthy ones.” This, of course, is the only rational way that the health insurance industry can work. Insurance companies, like all businesses, need to turn a profit, which means attracting more people who will pay more into the insurance pool than the sick and injured will withdraw from it. But then Reich, and liberals in general, are viscerally opposed to profit-taking (which they usually style “profiteering”). They have no moral qualms, on the other hand, with using the power of the state to extract ever more taxpayer money to fund Utopian projects such as single-payer healthcare systems that, over time, drain treasuries and degrade the quality of the healthcare they are supposed to improve. 
ObamaCare’s chief architect, MIT professor Jonathan Gruber, has argued at various times that, whether the Affordable Care Act succeeds or fails, a single-payer system is the final goal. In a candid discussion aired on CSPAN, Gruber indicated that if the ACA “doesn’t work, then we’ll have to revisit single payer. This bill is the last, best hope for private insurance.” But at a forum at Harvard University, Gruber disingenuously tried to explode the “fallacy” that “if Obamacare fails, then next we’ll go to single payer.” Instead, he suggested, the eventuality of a single-payer system depends on the success of Obama­Care, stating emphatically that “if you like single payer, then Obamacare has to succeed.” In other words, heads we win, tails you lose; no matter what happens with ObamaCare, America will have a single-payer system. 
One big surprise for the promoters of a single-payer system has been the speed with which ObamaCare has unraveled. Another surprise has been the election of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has promised to repeal ObamaCare, and the defeat of Hillary Clinton, who was expected to continue and build upon ObamaCare. Instead of having a decade or so to plan a smooth transition into fully centralized government-run healthcare, President Obama and his liberal backers in Washington not only face ferocious opposition to ObamaCare, but the Republicans — having retained majority control of both houses of Congress as well as capturing the White House — are now well positioned to scuttle ObamaCare, if that is what they truly intend to do. 
But will Trump as well as congressional Republicans who promised to get rid of ObamaCare actually do so? And will they work to replace it with free-market healthcare as opposed to a GOP variant of socialized medicine — ObamaCare-lite, perhaps? Of course, there is no doubt that proponents of single-payer healthcare are not going to give up, even if they are forced to take a temporary step back before advancing their agenda once again. They want full-blown socialized medicine in the United States, and they will eventually get it, unless principled opposition, coupled with a fuller understanding among the voting public of the folly of socialized medicine under any label , forces them into a complete rout.

20207,20207,Report Rebuts Russia’s Claims of Restraint in Syrian Bombing Campaign - The New York Times,Michael R. Gordon,"WASHINGTON  —   Russian military officials have vociferously denied that their airstrikes have killed civilians in Syria, going so far as to say that eyewitness accounts that a major hospital was bombed last year in the brutal fight to retake Aleppo were mere fabrications. But a new analysis that draws on satellite images, security camera videos, social media and even footage from the   Russian television network has challenged Moscow’s claims that its airstrikes on behalf of the Syrian military were an exercise in prudent restraint. The analysis shows that the hospital, contrary to claims by a Russian general, was bombed multiple times. It indicates that Russian aircraft used incendiary munitions and cluster bombs, despite the Kremlin’s denials, and concludes that Syrian forces used chlorine gas on a far greater scale than is commonly believed. The analysis is presented in a report, “Breaking Aleppo,” which is to be made public on Monday by the Atlantic Council, a   policy research center. The report comes as President Trump has signaled an interest in forging better connections with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, which could include working more closely with the Russian military in Syria. “Throughout the entire length of the battle for Aleppo, there have been multiple claims of violations of human rights and multiple denials,” said Eliot Higgins, a senior fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council. “What we have been able to present now is a wealth of evidence confirming the targeting of civilian structures, namely hospitals, which in certain cases has been denied by the Russian Ministry of Defense,” he added. “We have been able to confirm the use in civilian areas of a variety of indiscriminate weapons. ” Syrian forces, backed by Hezbollah fighters, Iran’s paramilitary Quds Force and Russian air power, took Aleppo in late December. The capture of the city was an important milestone that gave the government of President Bashar   control over all of Syria’s major cities and strengthened Moscow’s hand in discussions over the country’s future. But while the Atlantic Council report acknowledges that his victory in Aleppo has solidified Mr. Assad’s hold on power, at least for now, it argues that the ruthless strategy and tactics used by the Syrian and Russian governments would make the Syrian president “a poor if not harmful partner” in efforts to defeat the Islamic State and other extremist groups. Experts at the Atlantic Council have long urged the United States to do more to protect civilians in Syria and support the moderate opposition. In the report, the group employs hard evidence, including satellite images from DigitalGlobe, a commercial satellite company, fresh accounts from Syrian activists on the ground and photography published by Russia’s Defense Ministry. Much of the analysis of the photos and social media was done by Mr. Higgins, a   researcher who founded the investigative website bellingcat. com. A reconstruction of one key episode  —   the July 16 bombing of another hospital, known as M2, in the Maadi district  —   was carried out by Forensic Architecture, a research organization at Goldsmiths, University of London, which was asked to take an independent look at the video and photographic evidence of the bombing. Aleppo was divided in July 2012 between   and   areas. With the support of Russia, the Assad government began a major offensive in September of last year to take the city. Fragile and temporary   were used by the Syrians and their allies to prepare fresh offensives, which, despite Russian and Syrian denials, often targeted civilian areas. One claim that the Atlantic Council report challenges was issued by Lt. Gen. Sergei F. Rudskoi, the head of the operations directorate of the Russian general staff, who insisted in October that no damage had been done to the   hospital in a Russian bombing raid. To buttress his case, General Rudskoi displayed satellite photos that he said had been taken between Sept. 24 and Oct. 11. Eyewitness accounts to the contrary, he added, were “mere fakes. ” But a comparison of DigitalGlobe satellite photos taken on Sept. 25 and Oct. 13, the Atlantic Council report notes, shows the emergence of a large bomb crater near the hospital, also known as M10, and damage to the hospital building. Security camera videos from inside the hospital offer corroborating evidence of an Oct. 3 attack, as does a photo from the street by a local resident. The report concludes that there were several reasons to think the attacks on the medical centers were deliberate, including the large number of strikes, the Assad government’s knowledge of the terrain, and the Syrian government’s practice of confiscating medical supplies from humanitarian aid convoys. The M2 hospital was damaged by air and artillery strikes at least a dozen times between June and December. Other photographic evidence points to the use of incendiary munitions and cluster bombs. The   television channel, Russia Today, provided some of the evidence in video footage it showed in June that had been taken at a Russian air base near Latakia, Syria. (The version of the report that was later uploaded to YouTube deleted the images of the weapons being mounted on a Russian warplane.) When a Russian team later entered eastern Aleppo to clear away unexploded ordnance, a photograph published by the Russian Defense Ministry showed the remains of cluster bombs, the Atlantic Council report notes. A variety of reports from victims and video on YouTube indicate that Syrian government attacks with chlorine gas increased in the final phase of the battle for Aleppo. One video “showed a chlorine gas cylinder with its labels intact,” the report said. The use of chlorine bombs by the Syrian government, Mr. Higgins said, continued even after reports confirming their use were made by the United Nations and an international watchdog organization in The Hague that enforces the ban on the use of chemical agents in war.",0
20208,20208,Righting Wrongs and Generating Attention for Art of the African Diaspora - The New York Times,Ted Loos,"Sheena Wagstaff, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s modern and contemporary art department, was relatively new on the job in 2013 when Pamela J. Joyner, a prolific art collector and supporter of artists of African descent, invited her on a trip to Washington to visit the studio of the Color Field painter Sam Gilliam. They looked at Mr. Gilliam’s   pieces, a series of striking works with a thin stream of paint poured on board. Ms. Wagstaff knew the Met owned a Gilliam work, “Leah’s Renoir” (1979) somewhere in its collection, and the visit “prompted me to take a second look at it. ” Later, Ms. Joyner donated money to buy another Gilliam, “Whirlirama” (1970) and next year there are plans to exhibit both when the Met reinstalls its modern collection. “Pamela is such an informed champion of her artists,” Ms. Wagstaff said. That trip to Washington was one of the many ways that Ms. Joyner, 58, exerts her power as an   influence behind the scenes. She has relinquished a successful business career to become what she calls a   “ ” collector of a very specific niche: Abstract art by   and members of the global African diaspora. Now she leverages her relationships with the Met in New York, the Tate in London, the Art Institute in Chicago and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to help these artists gain traction in the wider world. “It’s no less ambitious than an effort to reframe art history,” said Ms. Joyner, who sees herself as righting a wrong. “First, to include more broadly those who have been overlooked  —   and, for those with visibility, to steward and contextualize those careers. ” When art collectors publish a book on their treasures, they often include a glamour shot of themselves surrounded by myriad works. But in “Four Generations: The   Collection of Abstract Art,” edited by Courtney J. Martin and published last month by Gregory R. Miller, there is no picture of Ms. Joyner anywhere. Instead, there are academic essays by curators and writers, with only a short “question and answer” segment with Ms. Joyner and her husband, Alfred J. Giuffrida. “That’s very deliberate,” Ms. Joyner said recently over coffee in Chelsea. “The focus is on the artists. ” Ms. Joyner, who is based in San Francisco but keeps an apartment in New York, founded and ran a private equity marketing company called Avid Partners. She started the collection 20 years ago and now adds to it with Mr. Giuffrida, an investment executive whom she married in 2004. Her trove, more than 300 works, begins in the 1940s and goes up to “yesterday,” Ms. Joyner said, encompassing four generations. Her definition of “African descent” has broadened to include William Kentridge, the white South African artist whose work has been in Ms. Joyner’s sights for some time. She just acquired her first Kentridge piece the other week in London. As an   woman in the corridors of establishment power  —   an education at Dartmouth and Harvard, and then an entrepreneurial career  —   she said she knew the feeling of being an outlier. “I’ve operated in environments where some people would construe me to be unusual,” she said. “And I am stitched together in a way that I find myself doing things that aren’t necessarily expected. So I relate to that journey. ” The book’s most telling photograph is from 1950, when Abstract Expressionists gathered in New York to discuss their work. Some were famous  —   Willem de Kooning and Robert Motherwell  —   but the black painter Norman Lewis ( ) whose work Ms. Joyner collects, was also there. “He’s literally at the table, but he gets written out of that history,” Ms. Joyner said. “His first monograph was only published last year. ” She explained some of the factors that kept black artists from gaining a foothold, especially in the 1960s and ’70s. “For a long time, the art world wanted black artists to do black subject matter,” she said. “Art was a political tool. People were viewed as not part of the struggle if they were doing abstraction. ” About 100 artists are in her collection, and Ms. Joyner referred to Lewis and the Washington Color School painter Alma Thomas ( ) as the “Adam and Eve” of the group, stylistically begetting the later generations. (Thomas is the subject of an exhibition at the Studio Museum in Harlem through Oct. 30.) Ms. Joyner’s largest holding, more than a dozen works, is of works by Mr. Gilliam, who is 82. She also owns pieces by successful midcareer artists like Kara Walker, Glenn Ligon and Mark Bradford, and is scouting out new talents. The   artists she is tracking include the Conceptual sculptor Kevin Beasley Hugo McCloud, who uses nontraditional materials in his paintings and Samuel Levi Jones, best known for his   works on canvas. The Los Angeles artist Charles Gaines, whose Abstract and Conceptual work is in her collection, said that “Four Generations” crystallized his longtime thinking about the context of his work as part of a continuum. “Pamela’s book is the first legitimate academic effort to theorize some of this material,” Mr. Gaines, 72, said. “It’s a pioneering effort. ” About 60 works from the   collection will tour in a museum show, “Solidary and Solitary,” beginning next fall at the Ogden Museum in New Orleans. Ms. Joyner buys about 30 works a year and has never sold one, she said, although she has donated them to museums. “Collecting is a job for Pamela,” said James Rondeau, director and president of the Art Institute of Chicago, in Ms. Joyner’s hometown, where she is a trustee. Over the years, Ms. Joyner has watched prices rise for many artists she has championed. “One curator said that I’m my own worst enemy,” she said with a wry smile. Lorna Simpson, an artist Ms. Joyner has collected and now befriended, noted that Ms. Joyner was no longer alone in her interest in the field. “The market was already starting to move around those pictures when she began,” Ms. Simpson said. “But she was ahead of it. ” Ms. Joyner is the daughter of two teachers, and she used to visit Georges Seurat’s “A Sunday on La Grande Jatte” at the Art Institute after attending ballet class. She noted that her mother moved from Mississippi to Chicago, where she attended her first integrated school. “There was a keen sense in my household that you had to be prepared for whatever was going to happen,” Ms. Joyner said. “You needed these literacies, and cultural literacy was one of them. ” Ms. Simpson, who also has family roots in Chicago, said she noted a “black Chicago thing” about Ms. Joyner’s outlook, which she defined as a forthright sense of humor, “a way of seeing the world. ” Ms. Joyner does take breaks from collecting. “I have slumber parties with my girlfriends, and that has included Lorna,” she said. So far, she said she was pleased by the reception to “Four Generations,” and had only one fear: that it might be misunderstood. “The danger of these projects is if people think it’s a politically laden,   exercise,” she said, in explaining that race is not the only lens through which to view art. “Those elements are there, but they are not the drivers. Good art is the driver. ”",0
20209,20209,NASA and FEMA Rehearse for the Unthinkable: An Asteroid Strike on Los Angeles - The New York Times,Christopher Mele,"Imagine if scientists discovered that an asteroid was hurtling toward Los Angeles. The possibility has existed on the pages of Hollywood scripts. But in what may be a case of life imitating art, NASA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other government agencies engaged last month in a planetary protection exercise to consider the potentially devastating consequences of a   asteroid hitting the Earth. The simulation projected a   blast wave by an asteroid strike in 2020 that could level structures across 30 miles, require a mass evacuation of the Los Angeles area and cause tens of thousands of casualties. In 1998, the movie “Armageddon” dramatized an even greater fictional threat. In that blockbuster, a ragtag crew was sent on a mission to drill into an asteroid and set off a nuclear bomb to avert a global catastrophe. As the character Harry Stamper, portrayed by Bruce Willis, summed up to his crewmates: “The United States government just asked us to save the world. ” Don’t expect the need for such Hollywood heroics in real life, however. An asteroid that could cause such damage has no significant chance of striking Earth within the next century, Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for   Object Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. said in an email. The center relies on several telescopes, such as the Catalina Sky Survey at the University of Arizona, to track potentially hazardous asteroids and comets. These objects, which are leftover matter from the formation of planets, can come dangerously close to Earth or cross its trajectory. The center lists 659 asteroids that have some probability of striking the planet, “but none pose a significant threat over the next century, either because the probabilities are extraordinarily small, or the asteroids themselves are extremely small,” Mr. Chodas said. “Nevertheless, we must continue searching for asteroids in case there is one that is heading our way,” he added. That’s where the planetary protection exercise, conducted on Oct. 25 in El Segundo, Calif. comes in. The simulation that projected a strike in 2020 involved representatives from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Department of Energy’s National Laboratories, the Air Force and the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. While a warning of four years may seem like a lot of time, it would probably not be enough to deflect an asteroid of the size and orbit outlined in the simulation, Mr. Chodas said. “Engineers think the simplest way to deflect an asteroid is to build a large spacecraft and simply ram it into the asteroid” years before it is predicted to hit Earth, he said. It could take up to two years to build such a “kinetic impactor” spacecraft and another year or more to reach the asteroid, so in the case of this simulation, an evacuation, not a “deflection mission,” was necessary. For the organizers of Asteroid Day, a global movement that seeks to protect the world from dangerous asteroids, such planning is not out of this world. The group, which maintains that one million asteroids have the potential to strike Earth but that only 1 percent of them have been discovered,  was set on Monday to release a letter signed by planetary scientists supporting missions to increase knowledge of asteroids. The group promotes the “100x Declaration,” which calls for increasing the rate of asteroid discoveries to 100, 000 per year in the next 10 years. “The more we learn about asteroid impacts, the clearer it became that the human race has been living on borrowed time,” Brian May, an astrophysicist and a founder and lead guitarist for the rock group Queen, said on the group’s website. Asteroid Day is observed each year on June 30, the anniversary of what is believed to be the largest   explosion in human history: an asteroid strike in Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908. An asteroid, believed to be less than 100 feet in diameter, exploded at the altitude of an airliner and flattened tens of millions of trees across 800 square miles. Researchers estimated the explosion was as powerful as a   hydrogen bomb and several hundred times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. While there were no official reports of human casualties, hundreds of reindeer were reduced to charred carcasses in the explosion, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported. In more recent times, an asteroid exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013, shattering windows for miles and injuring more than 1, 000 people. Scientists have suggested that the Earth is vulnerable to many more   space rocks. In research published in 2013 by the journal Nature, they estimated that such strikes could occur as often as every decade or two instead of an average of once every 100 to 200 years as previously thought. Predictions of a catastrophic crash by a celestial object surface with some regularity. In September 2015, the last eclipse of the year fueled imaginative speculation on the internet that a giant asteroid would hit Earth. In a statement debunking the idea, NASA noted that similar forecasts were made in January and March of that year that two asteroids were on dangerous paths toward Earth. The agency noted that the asteroids flew by Earth “without incident  —   just as NASA said they would. ”",0
20210,20210,"Mall Attack Threat Linked to Islamic State, Minister Confirms",Breitbart London,"BERLIN (AP)  —   A threatened attack against a mall in the western city of Essen is linked to the Islamic State extremist group, Germany’s interior minister said Sunday. [Thomas de Maiziere told public broadcaster ARD that Germany’s domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, had received “tips of an attack and passed them on” to local security authorities in Essen.  “The case was evaluated several times   …     and it couldn’t be eliminated that there could have been a concrete attack at this mall. This was prevented,” de Maiziere said. Daily papers Bild, Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung and public broadcaster WDR had reported earlier, citing anonymous security sources, that a German fighter with the IS in Syria had contacted via online messenger a group of fighters  —   based in Germany and abroad  —   and tried to motivate them to attack the mall Saturday. De Maiziere also confirmed a connection between “somebody who had traveled there from Germany and indications and assignments from that region. ” The mall in Essen, one of the biggest in Germany, didn’t open Saturday. About 100 heavily armed police officers positioned themselves around the compound to prevent anyone from entering. The apartments of two men were later searched in nearby Oberhausen and they were detained and interrogated. One was released Saturday, police said, with no details. The mall in downtown Essen will open again on Monday because there is no longer an increased threat of an attack, the German news agency dpa reported. Germany has been on the edge following a series of attacks in public places over the past year. When a man went on a rampage with an axe on Friday night at Duesseldorf’s main station and injured 10 people, hundreds of police officers were deployed to the scene, even though it later turned out that he had no links to extremists, but was suffering from psychological problems.",0

20212,20212,Comedy Central Cancels Larry Wilmore’s Late-Night Show - The New York Times,John Koblin,"For almost a decade, the combination of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert made Comedy Central destination viewing for fans of   comedy and barbed political commentary. But over the last 12 months, the   and   era has not been as easy for the network. On Monday, Comedy Central announced that it was canceling “The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore” because of falling ratings and a distinct lack of buzz. The final episode of Mr. Wilmore’s 11:30 p. m. show  —   the slot formerly occupied by Mr. Colbert before he left for CBS  —   will be Thursday. Kent Alterman, Comedy Central’s president, said he informed Mr. Wilmore of the news late last week. The move, Mr. Alterman said in an interview, was made for a simple reason: The show “hasn’t resonated. ” “Even though we’ve given it a year and a half, we’ve been hoping against hope that it would start to click with our audience, but it hasn’t happened, and we haven’t seen evidence of it happening,” Mr. Alterman said. The awkward timing of the cancellation, just 12 weeks before the presidential election, ultimately came down to a contract, Mr. Alterman said. Mr. Wilmore’s deal, along with those of several of the show’s other staff members, was set to expire in a few weeks and the network had to decide now whether to renew or cancel. For the time being, Comedy Central’s 12 a. m. show, “@midnight,” will replace “The Nightly Show” at 11:30 p. m. “The Daily Show” with Trevor Noah remains at 11 p. m. Mr. Alterman said he hoped to name a   replacement for “The Nightly Show” sometime next year. The cancellation makes Mr. Wilmore, 54, an early casualty of a television   comedy slate that has been vastly reordered over the last two years. With the retirement of David Letterman, Jay Leno and Mr. Stewart, and Mr. Colbert’s move to CBS, a series of new hosts have stepped into the spotlight, including James Corden, Samantha Bee, John Oliver and Mr. Noah. Jimmy Fallon, the host of “The Tonight Show,” has most formidably filled the power vacuum left by his predecessors, earning the highest ratings of any   show. While Mr. Stewart was the host of “The Daily Show,” Mr. Wilmore became a fixture as the program’s “senior black correspondent,” offering wry observations on racial issues. In May 2014, Mr. Stewart tapped Mr. Wilmore to get his own show, and Mr. Wilmore formally became Mr. Colbert’s successor when “The Nightly Show” premiered in January 2015. “The Nightly Show” has been known for a signature segment, “Keep It 100,” (slang for telling the truth, no matter the consequences) and for Mr. Wilmore’s often stinging commentary on race and this year’s election. (He called the election to find Barack Obama’s successor “The Unblackening. ”) Though the   genre remains heavy on easygoing laughter, any one episode of “The Nightly Show” could occasionally go for prolonged stretches without a single joke, something that intrigued some critics but failed to attract a broader audience. “I’m really grateful to Comedy Central, Jon Stewart and our fans to have had this opportunity,” Mr. Wilmore said in a statement. “But I’m also saddened and surprised we won’t be covering this crazy election or ‘The Unblackening’ as we’ve coined it. And keeping it 100, I guess I hadn’t counted on ‘The Unblackening’ happening to my time slot as well. ” The move by Comedy Central is also the first concession that the transition from Mr. Stewart and Mr. Colbert  —   both pioneers of a certain kind of political comedy as media criticism and social commentary  —   to Mr. Noah and Mr. Wilmore has not gone as smoothly as the network had hoped. Though Mr. Alterman strongly defended Mr. Noah’s iteration of “The Daily Show”  —   next month will be his first anniversary as host  —   both Mr. Noah and Mr. Wilmore have failed to capture the critical praise that rivals like Ms. Bee, Mr. Corden and Mr. Oliver have enjoyed. This year, for the first time in 16 years, “The Daily Show” was not nominated for an Emmy in the best variety show category. Mr. Noah and Mr. Wilmore have also lost a good portion of the audience that used to tune in to Comedy Central between 11 p. m. and midnight. “The Daily Show” had an average of 2. 1 million viewers a night in Mr. Stewart’s final year as host, while Mr. Noah’s audience has averaged 1. 3 million, according to data from Nielsen. And Mr. Wilmore has lost more than half the audience that he inherited. In Mr. Colbert’s final year as host of “The Colbert Report,” he had an average audience of 1. 7 million viewers, but in Mr. Wilmore’s first year, that viewership fell to an average of 922, 000 viewers, according to Nielsen. This year, the total has fallen to 776, 000 viewers a night. Likewise, in the demographic most important to Comedy Central  —   young men  —   he has not made a dent. In recent months, Mr. Wilmore has even started losing to the show that is on after his, “@midnight. ” Mr. Wilmore’s most visible role in the last year may have been his turn as host of the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. But reviews for his act were decidedly mixed, and the exposure did not result in a ratings bounce. Mr. Alterman said that he had hoped that there would be a ratings surge  —   particularly around the political conventions  —   and that the decision to cancel “The Nightly Show” was a recent one. “We were hoping that we would get a turnaround along the way including the wild, wild two weeks of the conventions,” he said. “We just haven’t seen it on any level from the general conversation to ratings to any sort of traction on social media platforms. ” That stands in contrast, he said, to what the network has seen regarding Mr. Noah. Calling the perception that Mr. Noah is struggling “a myth,” Mr. Alterman pointed to the show’s strong performance on Hulu  —   though he is not allowed to disclose figures, he said. Mr. Noah’s show is the No. 2   show among young adults ages 18 to 34, Mr. Alterman said, and his ratings have grown among   to    men. Mr. Alterman said he “couldn’t be happier” with Mr. Noah’s performance. “In the last couple of weeks  —   leading up to the conventions and especially the conventions  —   we feel like Trevor got to a whole new level in terms of having a strong voice and point of view,” he said. “It’s been no surprise to us.

20213,20213,The Anatomy of Crisis and the Decline of US Empire,Danny Haiphong,"The Anatomy of Crisis and the Decline of US Empire Submitted by Danny Haiphong on Tue, 11/08/2016 - 12:18 Tweet Widget by Danny Haiphong 
There are multiple dimensions to the crisis that afflicts U.S. imperialism. The latest election is evidence of a crisis of legitimacy for the ruling parties. Americans are estranged from a government that spies on every one its citizens – and on the rest of the world, too. “Unemployment, poverty, racist state repression, and war are all the system has to offer.” Unable to escape a 40-year economic slump, the U.S. instead plots the destruction of its rivals. The Anatomy of Crisis and the Decline of US Empire by Danny Haiphong 
“ The vast majority of oppressed communities, particularly Black workers, have seen their labor become disposable in a post-industrial society.” 
Whether one analyzes the economic, military, or political spheres of US imperialism, one thing is abundantly clear. The very fabric of the United States is in deep crisis. The crisis is largely misunderstood by the vast majority of working and oppressed people living under it. But a specter haunts the US and it isn't anything like Hollywood's scary movies. That specter is the possibility that the people will become a conscious force of opposition to the crisis and seek to dismantle the system of capitalist empire that governs it. 
Crises are genuinely thought of in economic terms. The economic base of capitalism is indeed suffering from protracted economic crisis. The US capitalist economy, and thus the world capitalist economy pegged to its hip, entered a period of stagnation in the mid to late 1970s. What followed was a slowdown in production facilitated by the increased monopolization, financialization, and increased technological capacity of the system. Capitalism's source of profit, labor, was now being exploited by an apparatus too big to expand the profits of the system without intensified exploitation. The aftermath of capitalism's periodic collapses from overproduction and under consumption have been characterized ever since by a complete and total assault on all workers. 
“Wages have declined or remained stagnant for nearly four decades.” 
The conditions of the crisis speak for themselves. Workers in the US, and the entire Western world for that matter, have seen conditions rapidly deteriorate as the capitalist system has sought to maximize profits in the face of productive slowdown. Free trade agreements such as NAFTA have given corporations the freedom to eliminate production domestically in order to seek a better deal internationally. Wages have declined or remained stagnant for nearly four decades . Unemployment has become a permanent fixture of life for millions and nearly one of two people in the US are considered poor or ""near poor."" 
At this time, the US is a low-wage capitalist economy dominated by service oriented, precarious employment. Racism has played a large part in the disparity inherent under these conditions. The wealth gap between Black America and White America is larger than it was in the Civil rights era. Not only has Black America been the target of racist housing policies from predatory lenders leading up to the 2008 crisis, but the burden of privatization and austerity has been directly aimed at Black families. Hedge funds, for example, have used working class Black communities as the guinea pig to test the effectiveness of massive school closures and teacher layoffs as well as the expansion of charter schools. Thousands of Black teachers have lost their jobs as a result to the mostly white demographic of Teach for America corps members. 
“ The wealth gap between Black America and White America is larger than it was in the Civil rights era.” 
However, it is not enough to understand the crisis of capitalism through an economic lens. The crisis possesses many forms. Repressive state activity has become more pronounced, especially in the aftermath of the War on Terror. Racist repression in particular has intensified as the vast majority of oppressed communities, particularly Black workers, have seen their labor become disposable in a post-industrial society. Nearly 1100 Black Americans are killed every year by law enforcement all over the country. The war on Black and indigenous peoples that laid the foundation of the United States has only become more severe, as evidenced by the fact that one of every eight prisoners in the world is a Black American. The Dakota Access Pipeline struggle has shown that not even the concentration camps forced upon indigenous people are safe from the profit-seeking tentacles of the crisis-ridden system. 
And every American can guarantee that civil liberties are a thing of the past. The NSA, FBI, and the rest of the intelligence community possess access to the entire population's mail and phone devices. A massive surveillance dragnet accountable to no one but the ruling class allows the US state to keep tabs on whoever resists the conditions of the crisis. War at home is ultimately a reflection of the broader war being waged around the world. The US capitalist system is a global system with the largest military state in human history. War has thus played a critical role in the response to system crisis. 
The US military acts as the enforcement arm of neo-colonialism and capitalist exploitation around the world. It has expanded into nearly every African state through the US African Command (AFRICOM). The US military state continues to support fascism in Ukraine and fundamentalist Islam in places like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. It has destabilized a number of nations in the last decade alone, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya. The US has collaborated with NATO, Israel, and Turkey to militarily encircle Russia and China militarily and sponsor terror groups responsible for the massacres in Syria. 
“The US imperialist system is predicated on the expansion of global capital by any means at its disposal, including the use military force to clear the way for corporate plunder. 
But the US military is in crisis too. It is plagued by a disillusioned rank and file and the inevitability of a global confrontation with Russia and China if it continues on the current course. The demands of a stagnating global capitalist economy and the ever-increasing exploitation of masses of working people offer no potential for a reversal of fortune. The US imperialist system is predicated on the expansion of global capital by any means at its disposal, including the use military force to clear the way for corporate plunder. The US military state has grown both in size and in violence in order to prevent the global shift of power currently underway. 
Russia and China have become the number one challengers to US global hegemony. China's economy will soon surpass that of the US and Russia's recovery from post-Soviet collapse has propelled the Putin-led nation back onto the global scene as a major factor in world affairs. These two powers are becoming increasingly close both economically and militarily. This has made the US ruling class increasingly nervous in the midst of economic decline. To maintain hegemony, the US military state set the world ablaze through endless war in every region of the world that dares to seek ties with Russia and China. 
At this point, the US imperialist system cannot peacefully compete in any way with its so-called rivals to the East. The contradictions of the system have become unmanageable. Unemployment, poverty, racist state repression, and war are all the system has to offer. Another economic collapse is on the horizon. Crisis is built into the global capitalist system's constant drive to accumulate profit in the face of global misery. The decline of US imperialism and empire will not change regardless of the election. What is sure to change is the mass reaction to the decline as life becomes more and more unbearable under the grip of empire.

20214,20214,"Flood Rips Through Historic Maryland Town, Killing at Least 2 - The New York Times",Mike McPhate,"Ellicott City, Md. a historic town west of Baltimore, was devastated by flooding on Saturday night after more than six inches of rain fell in just two hours, sending a   current down its Main Street and leaving at least two people dead. Officials and witnesses said the floodwaters rushed through the downtown area after torrential rain fell between 7 and 9 p. m. It ripped up sidewalks, gutted many of the town’s quaint shops and carried off vehicles, depositing some of them blocks away. The body of a woman was recovered from the nearby Patapsco River early on Sunday, and the body of a man was also found, said Mark Miller, a spokesman for Howard County, where Ellicott City is the county seat. “This was a different type of flooding than you would normally get when just the Patapsco rises  —   far more devastating,” Mr. Miller said. “It’s like the water was a piston. The water came through with such force. ” Gov. Larry Hogan and Representative Elijah E. Cummings visited the destruction early on Sunday. Mr. Hogan signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for Howard County. Mr. Cummings, who has an office on Main Street, said in a statement that the flooding had “devastated countless businesses and residents in Ellicott City. ” “Recovering from this disaster will be long and difficult,” he said. The downtown area has been evacuated and closed off while emergency crews assess the safety of the buildings there. County officials asked residents to be patient during what some anticipated would be a monthslong rebuilding process. Founded in 1772 as a mill town, Ellicott City has for the past several decades catered to tourists with its historic charm and antique shops, said Shawn Gladden, the executive director of the Howard County Historical Society. The town’s location in the Patapsco River Valley has made it susceptible to flooding. On Sunday, some of its roughly 65, 000 residents were already drawing comparisons to the two biggest floods in its recorded history, the flood of 1868 and flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. “They call them the   floods,” Mr. Gladden said. “And this one may rival that. ” The National Weather Service had issued warnings about potential floods on Saturday, and at one point sent a sharply worded bulletin: “This is a particularly dangerous situation. Seek higher ground now!” Despite the warnings, the ferocity of the waters came as a surprise to many workers and residents in downtown Ellicott City, trapping them where they were. Inside Bean Hollow, the water rose swiftly to about three feet. With no time to flee, the coffee shop’s workers scrambled to an apartment on the second floor. “This was a true flash flood,” said Jim Bolton, who has owned Bean Hollow with his wife for about 14 years. “By the time people realized there was a potential hazard, it was far too late for anyone to do anything. ” Mr. Bolton said he expected the rebuilding of Ellicott City to be a long road. “It’s decimated right now,” he said. “But it’s certainly had its share of floods and fires and all sorts of madness over the years. It will rise again. ”",0
20215,20215,‘McCarthyism’ Rides Again. And It's Again Poisoning the Foundations of a Free Society in the US - Justin Raimondo,nan,"‘McCarthyism’ Rides Again. And It's Again Poisoning the Foundations of a Free Society in the US 
Smears and intimidation vs. free debate, civil liberties and peace Originally appeared at Anti War 
I’m often taken to task by some of my readers for characterizing the current anti-Russian hysteria as “McCarthyism.” After all, they say, Sen. Joseph McCarthy was right – there were, indeed, high-ranking individuals in the US government covertly sympathetic to the Soviet regime. And, yes, we now know that many of these were working directly for Soviet intelligence. 
This was the predictable result of our wartime alliance with Russia: combined with the left-wing proclivities of the Roosevelt administration, and the “Popular Front” politics of the Communist Party USA during this period, it’s surprising that Soviet penetration of US government circles wasn’t more extensive than it turned out to be. 
In any case, what we are seeing today with the revival of the cold war mindset is in many ways the complete opposite of the “old” McCarthyism: the target may be the same – Russia as the bogeyman de jour – but the methods and sources of the neo-McCarthyites are quite different. 
To begin with, the “old” McCarthyism was a movement generated from below, and aimed at the elites: the “new” McCarthyism is a media construct, generated from above and created by the elites. 
The average American, while hardly a Putin groupie, is not lying awake at night worrying about the “Russian threat.” The fate of Ukraine, not to mention Crimea, is so far from his concerns that the distance can only be measured in light-years. And when some new scandal breaks as a result of WikiLeaks releasing the emails of Hillary Clinton’s inner circle, Joe Sixpack doesn’t think “Oh, that just proves Julian Assange is a Kremlin toady!” WikiLeaks is merely confirming what Joe already knew: that Washington is a cornucopia of corruption. 
The Acela corridor elite, on the other hand, does lie awake at night wondering how they can pull off a regime change operation that will eliminate the “threat” represented by Putin once and for all. Ever since the Russian leader started mocking Washington’s hegemonic pretensions, criticizing the US invasion of Iraq, and pointing out how US-funded Syrian “rebels” are merely jihadists in “moderate” clothing, Putin has been in their crosshairs – and the propaganda war has been relentless. 
This barrage has gone into overdrive with the launching of the Clinton campaign’s effort to smear Donald Trump as a Kremlin “puppet. ” You have to go all the way back to the earliest days of our Republic, when pro-British supporters of Alexander Hamilton were sliming the Jeffersonian Democrats with accusations that they were agents of the French revolutionaries, to come up with the historical equivalent of Hillary’s “you’re a puppet” charges directed at Trump. And the media, being an auxiliary of the Clinton campaign, has been filled with even more virulent screeds purporting to “prove” Trump is the Manchurian candidate . 
One way in which the new McCarthyism is very much like the old is that it threatens to poison the intellectual atmosphere in this country, endangering the very foundations of our free society and academic standards of free inquiry and debate. Emblematic of this trend is a tweet authored by Dan Drezner , professor of international relations at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, and a foreign affairs columnist at theWashington Post, in which he commented on a talk he heard at the Valdai conference, a regular event held in Russia focusing on Russo-American relations: 
“At Valdai, John Mearsheimer says the Chinese and Russians love his realism. ‘I’m much more comfortable in Moscow than Washington!’"" 
Mearsheimer is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of political science at the University of Chicago, the author of six books, and the leading theoretician of the school of international relations known as “offensive realism.” He is, in short a scholar of some renown – and yet Drezner, considerably lower on the academic totem pole, feels empowered to slime him as somehow disloyal. How did we come to this sad state of affairs? 
The poisoning of a society with propaganda used to take some time: today, the process is much faster, due to technological innovation, and especially the rise of the Internet and the growth of social media. In the old days, the McCarthyites had to rely on print media and radio to smear those “pinko college professors” and drive them out of academia. Today, someone like Drezner can sign in to their Twitter account and snark about how John Mearsheimer is more at home in Moscow and Beijing than in the good ol’ US of A, and his thousands of Twitter followers get the idea – that Mearsheimer is somehow anti-American – in an instant (and in only twenty words!). 
The “old” McCarthyism was dangerous because, in some cases, people were targeted unfairly: anybody with dissident views was suspect, and especially anyone with vaguely left-wing opinions. And McCarthyism, which in its original form saw the main danger to America to be internal, soon morphed into something else entirely: a movement that sought a military confrontation with the Soviet Union. Indeed, it was McCarthyism that was the bridge that allowed neoconservative interventionists to invade the conservative movement and displace the “isolationism” of the Old Right. 
The new McCarthyism poses new dangers that are, perhaps, more virulent than the old version and will have more immediate consequences. The above-mentioned smear of Prof. Mearsheimer encapsulates what the dangers are to academia: in the 1950s, left-wing professors had at least some protection from populist McCarthyites in that academics tended to jealously guard their turf and protect their own from outside incursions. Today, with the elites pushing Russophobia, those protections fall by the wayside. 
Furthermore, the political class, where the new McCarthyism is rampant, has power – that is, it can translate its prejudices into policy more readily than any mass movement such as the one led by “Tail-gunner Joe.” If Hillary Clinton and her advisors really believe that Putin is out to defeat her and elect her opponent, then what can we expect will happen to US-Russian relations if and when she’s elected? 
And while the American people aren’t exactly up in arms over the prospect of a “Red Dawn” scenario unfolding in the streets of America’s cities, the “mainstream” media’s longstanding anti-Russian crusade is clearly having an effect. A Pew poll shows that anti-Russian sentiment in the United States rose “from 43% to 72% from 2013 to 2014.” The “trickle down” effects of war propaganda work just as effectively as the “trickle-up” model, if not more so. 
The real world consequences of a conflict with Russia, a nuclear-armed state, are fearsome to even contemplate: the political class in this country is playing a dangerous game of chicken, and they’re playing it with our lives and the lives of every person on earth. 
Aside from the prospect of World War III, the effects of the new McCarthyism will be to distort our politics, infect our culture, and threaten our constitutional rights as Americans. It is entirely possible that a new witch-hunt will be launched by the Russia-haters in our midst, with a revived “Un-American Activities Committee” replete with congressional hearings, as well as “investigations” by law enforcement of “pro-Russian”“subversive” activities. With the media acting as a cheerleading section for these official and unofficial arbiters of political correctness, our future as a free society will be increasingly in doubt. 
Finally, the new McCarthyism underscores the cynicism, opportunism, and downright viciousness of our political class, and especially the media, which has done nothing to question and everything to bolster the Russophobic propaganda put out there by self-serving lobbyists and politicians. It truly is a sickening sight, made all the more so by the self-professed “liberalism” of those who are in the vanguard of this revolting trend. 
What these folks should remember is that the “old” McCarthyism was in large part a reaction to the “ Brown scare ” of the Roosevelt era, when “isolationist” conservatives were smeared as “agents of Hitler,” driven out of their jobs, and in some instances charged with “sedition.” This bout of war hysteria was driven, first of all, by the Communist Party and its media contingent, which had become more-patriotic-than-thou when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union and the Communist line on the war changed overnight. However, when the world situation changed again, and the Soviets were in Washington’s sights, the tables were abruptly turned – and Sen. McCarthy’s crusade took off. 
The same thing can happen again. If the consequences of the new McCarthyism come to fruition in an armed conflict with Russia, or even a nuclear exchange, as Americans emerge from the radioactive wreckage they’ll be looking for someone to blame – and scapegoats won’t be that hard to find.  ",1
20216,20216,Young musicians from France at Motorola funeral share their emotions at the Saur Mogila Memorial,Tom Winter (noreply@blogger.com),"November 25, 2016 - Fort Russ News - 
-  Christelle NEAN  in DONiPRESS, translated by Tom Winter - 
СПАСИБО! Thank you! 
Donetsk 25 Nov 2016 The program of the third day of visit of the French group was totally turned around by the always moving news of the Donbass. That was the day of the funeral commemoration of Commander Motorola, murdered three days earlier during a bomb attack in the elevator of his building.  

Our visitors took part in this moving ceremony, placing flowers near his coffin, and joining the people gathered in the center of Donetsk to bid farewell to one of the most emblematic and well-known commanders of the People's Republic of Donetsk (RPD). 



They saw with their own eyes the incredible number of ordinary citizens who came to pay homage to this hero of the republic. The first approximate figures of 30,000 people were adjusted later to at least 50,000 people who were there to bid farewell and show their attachment to this commander who had come to help the people of Donbass to defend their freedom. 

Billboards were installed in the city center with the photo of Commander Motorola and the phrase ""Heroes do not die."" It was only proper that we go immediately after the funeral to the high place of commemoration of the heroes fallen for the defense of freedom: the hill of Saur Mogila. What better place than this height, twice the subject of intense fighting, and twice retaken at great cost by soldiers defending freedom, to ponder on all those who have, like Commander Motorola, sacrificed their lives for this ideal? 

The memorial is no more than a field of ruins, yet several times a year people come here by thousands to celebrate, for example, the Liberation of the Donbass in 1943 or the Victory Ceremonies of 1945. The tombs both at the foot and at top of the hill are there to remind that during the present war, again, the defenders of the Donbass have paid a heavy price for this freedom that they cherish so much. 


""It's here in the Donbass that they are fighting for freedom, and in the West they're called terrorists,"" Roxane said. 

The people of Donbass, like the people of Russia, cultivate and maintain their memory and their history, so that the errors of the past can no longer be repeated. Follow us for the interview of Antoine and Roxane at the end of this day full of emotions, with their comments on the soul of the Donbass, who are the real terrorists in this war, the support of the Donbass population towards their army, and what their journey has already brought them at the end of these three days:

The 31-year-old took to Instagram to share a photo of herself posed with her hands on her mega hips wearing the ‘Respect Women #Dump Trump’ shirt. ( Hey, why wasn’t she arrested for causing visual pollution in Times Square? ) UK Daily Mail ‘Respect Women,’ she captioned the image. ‘Our bodies are not for you to stare at or touch without our consent. Women are not just sexual objects, women are not here for your consumption. (One problem you don’t have, cupcake) The 31-year-old took to Instagram over the weekend to share an ad of herself posing in New York City’s Times Square while modeling a New Look Fashion T-shirt that reads: ‘Respect Women #Dump Trump.’ So many of us have a sexual assault story, myself included,’ she continued. (Gee, were you 100 pounds lighter then?) ‘To endorse someone who not just condones this behavior but actively engages in it would be an awful step backwards for women not just in the US but across the world. ‘Also might I add I’m NOT telling you who to vote for. Trump is a pig & that’s a fact.’ (But obviously, you are supporting a pig – Hillary Clinton – who has verbally abused all the women who were sexually assaulted/raped by her husband) Last week Tess made an appearance (above left) alongside model Iskra Lawrence and Orange is the New Black star Danielle Brooks at Refinery29’s Every Beautiful Body Symposium in New York City, wearing a figure-hugging dress. In celebration of Halloween, Tess also posted a throwback photo of her and Nick dressed as Miss Argentina and Beetlejuice from the 1988 film. ‘But how do I top last year?’ she wrote. We pulled these costumes off in two days, and I’m pretty darn proud.’ There was also a fierce debate about whether or not Tess’ post could be seen as an endorsement for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, and some people who disagreed with her statement attacked the size 22 model for her weight. ‘There is some super hateful stuff on here,’ one woman wrote. ‘And targeting her weight because you disagree?

20218,20218,How Secure is Your Cellphone ??,Eddy Lavine,"posted by Eddie Ever wonder how cellphones went from being a point of wealth to household commodity? Well, there’s reason to believe that the accessibility of cellphones isn’t purely coincidental. The thought originated with metadata and the possibilities made possible through the documentation of information that cellphones provide, through both backdoor access and the location data each phone provides. FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, is an incredibly secret court that answers to no one and, has autonomy in not only their proceeding and rulings, but, is also highly-classified. Through this system, President’s George Bush and Barrack Obama have enabled their own domestic surveillance practices. Although, The NSA is heavily involved as well. In doing so, the government has created programs and jobs that are specific to collecting and translating meta-data. The government would have you believe that meta-data is not as invasive as specific data, but, let’s consider it this way. Imagine your coordinates being reported by the second, from the time you wake in the morning, during your commute to work, and whichever plans you have afterwards. This data system gives insight into each particular location, phone call, and the duration of said phone calls to these data collectors. Imagine being able to see each and every step your better half or child has throughout the day, and you notice they stops at location that seem unusual or speak/communicate with numbers/people unfamiliar to you while having access to the duration of those calls. Although, this leaves an opportunity for misconception, but, it also brings us to an objective truth, how revealing metadata can be. Edward Snowden, a former NSA employer who specialized in technology in the cyber division, released classified documents involving both government programs that enacted policies, and, FISA court rulings on said programs. These revelations brought his need to flee for asylum in China, and then and currently, Russia. Snowden’s attempt of transparency let Americans learn just how much census data has changed and the contracts deployed between the government and the major communications companies, such as AT&T. These companies have made millions by granting backdoor access and data to the government. Yet, this isn’t all bad. Local officials have occasionally solicited access, through communication companies, to find criminals and perpetrators of crime. For example, in 2013 California officials used the data and cellphone accessibility to find the murderer that slaughtered a man, his wife, and their two children. Until the solicitation, the local officials weren’t close to right suspect. After collaboration, the local officials were able to find, through metadata collection, analysis, and cellphone GPS, the exact location of the murderer. So, you tell me, do you think your phone is as private as you think? Written by Anthony A Fabrikant. From Around the Web Founder of WorldTruth.Tv and WomansVibe.com Eddie ( 8889 Posts )

20219,20219,The Guide to Being an Airbnb Superhost - The New York Times,Brian X. Chen,"IN my spare time, when not writing about consumer technology for The New York Times, I have a sideline renting out a cabin on Airbnb. So when Jose reserved the property last October, it was nothing unusual. He said he wanted to host some relatives for a quiet weekend in the mountains. I welcomed him without hesitation. That Saturday, my neighbors texted me as they watched caterers carry large white pillars and bouquets into the backyard. Then 10 cars surrounded the front yard and dozens of people wearing suits and dresses poured into the house. It became clear this was no intimate  . For a day, my Airbnb rental was turned into a wedding venue, which broke city laws. My business would be in jeopardy if the police were notified. Such is life as an Airbnb “Superhost. ” Since buying my cabin in Northern California in late 2015, I have hosted about 30 groups and become part of the booming ecosystem for Airbnb, the online reservation marketplace that lets people turn their homes into vacation rentals. With more than 140 million guest arrivals to date, Airbnb has proved a boon for hosts and an attractive option for travelers looking to avoid hefty fees from hotels. In the process, I have been named a Superhost, which means I have hosted many guests and consistently received   reviews. It’s a small group  —   researchers say only about 7 percent of hosts are Superhosts. In exchange, I get more visibility in search results, invitations from the company to exclusive events and a medal next to my profile photo. The designation as a Superhost has paid off: My house is a few bookings away from netting a profit. Yet vaulting to Superhost status is hardly intuitive, and I learned hard lessons along the way. Here are some tips on running a successful (and lucrative) Airbnb rental based on interviews with Superhosts and my experience. People who rent your house on Airbnb are choosing it over a hotel. So you had better be as hospitable, friendly and communicative as a hotel. For your rental, that means a few things. Provide staples like cooking equipment, cable TV, soap for bathing and cleaning, towels, toothpaste and toilet paper. Your house should work as advertised  —   faulty appliances should be repaired or replaced. For another, be extremely responsive to guests, much like a hotel front desk. Nobody trusts a host who is slow to respond. Jasper Ribbers, a   of “Get Paid for Your Pad,” a book about his experience as an Airbnb Superhost who has completed more than 300 stays, uses the app AvivaIQ to respond automatically to messages from potential guests, which comes in handy when he is asleep. When he is awake, he can continue the conversation. Being dishonest about your listing will hurt when it comes time for a guest to leave a review. It’s better to be straightforward about what you are offering and transparent about any imperfections. In my experience, guests were surprised in the summer that the house lacked   even though the listing never said it had  . I resolved this with subsequent guests by saying explicitly in my welcome email that the house lacked   and that portable fans were in each room. Be quick to address complaints, or risk facing a negative review. If a dishwasher breaks or the shower pressure is too low, send a plumber. If a remote control was misplaced or stolen by a previous group, have a backup remote ready in a drawer. If you host the property remotely, the best option is to befriend someone trustworthy in the neighborhood who can act as a property manager. Pay the manager a fee for each task. Airbnb attracts travelers from all over the world, and it is remarkable how standards for cleanliness differ from person to person. My jaw dropped when one guest left a positive review about her stay, but dropped me one star because the   brush was dirty. (Couldn’t she have used the clean sponge instead?) There is no point acting defensive. The solution is to hire superb professional cleaners. Relay any negative feedback from guests to your cleaners so they improve over time. Depending on where your house is, demand may be higher at certain times of year. If you hope to ever make a profit, you will want to set prices higher during peak rental seasons, and reduce prices during slow seasons. But constantly changing prices on your listing can be daunting. I use a dynamic pricing tool, BeyondPricing. com, that automatically adjusts prices based on demand, including factors like holidays, peak travel season and the day of the week. (Airbnb provides its own dynamic pricing tool called Smart Pricing, but in my experience it chooses rates that are too low.) Last year, Airbnb introduced an   policy that urged hosts to welcome guests regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender and age. That makes sense, since Airbnb wants to connect hosts with travelers from all over the world. But it doesn’t mean you should let just anybody into your home. Hosts reserve the right to decide what types of groups they would like to host, especially when taking into consideration city laws. For my rental, city law forbids loud parties past 10 p. m. When guests request the house, I ask them the purpose of the visit and ask them to carefully read and agree to my house rules, including one about loud noise. I am less inclined to book a group of college students looking to have a party than I am to book a family planning a winter vacation. (Though if the students promised to stay quiet, I would probably book them.) Mr. Ribbers, the Airbnb Superhost, said he preferred families or couples staying in his   apartment in Amsterdam partly because of the size constraints. He also typically accepts bookings only from guests who already have positive reviews themselves. When guests reserve his home, he reads their profiles to get a sense of their personalities and check if they have verified their identities with Airbnb by providing driver’s license information, among other documentation. Some vetting is permitted by Airbnb’s nondiscrimination policy, which says hosts can decline to rent based on factors that are not prohibited by law  —   so my rejection of those planning to have loud parties fits the bill. Another important point is to describe your listing depending on the guests you want. Mr. Ribbers titled his listing “Couples Getaway. ” My listing, intended to attract family ski trips, advertises the house’s proximity to the ski lifts. Most guests are not bad people. But perhaps one out of 10 times, a rotten egg will pass your smell test. The lesson I learned from Jose was that being a Superhost did not make me impervious to the actions of a misbehaving guest. To protect yourself, diligently document everything valuable in your house. Take photos of countertops, the refrigerator, stove, dining table, barbecue grill and television set. In the event anything is damaged, Airbnb will ask for    photos to prove that guests caused the damage. With Jose, after an Airbnb representative evicted the group for breaking my house rules, I found a large chip in my kitchen countertop. After sending Airbnb the photo of the damaged countertop, a company representative concluded it was not reasonable to let me keep Jose’s security deposit because “there is no way to document whether or not the chip on the counter was there before or after this guest stayed at the listing. ” Airbnb did agree to charge Jose for excess guests  —   but only for those my neighbors were able to photograph. Nick Shapiro, an Airbnb spokesman, said I should have been treated better and the company apologized that its resolution process “did not work as it was supposed to in this incident. ” In my conversations with Jose, he insisted that he did nothing wrong and that I broke the contract by kicking his group out of the house. Neither of us could leave each other a review because his reservation was voided.",0
20220,20220,3 Year Old Son of Singer Michael Bublé Diagnosed With Cancer,nan,"You Are Here: Home » Cancer » 3 Year Old Son of Singer Michael Bublé Diagnosed With Cancer 3 Year Old Son of Singer Michael Bublé Diagnosed With Cancer Prev post Next post 
There isn’t a single parent alive, famous or not, that doesn’t fear for their children’s health and safety. None of us ever wants to confront the reality that one of our kids is sick, but that’s just what singer Michael Bublé and his wife, Luisana, are facing. 
Their eldest son, Noah, was just diagnosed with cancer. He’s just three years old. 
The family were dealt the tragic blow after the youngster visited doctors with a suspected case of mumps , Argentinian website La Nacion reports . 
“They’re staying positive and Noah is a fighter.” 
Argentinian journalist Tomas Dente read out a text message from Daniela on a morning TV show which said: “To tell you the truth I’m devastated. This is very recent. 
“The only thing I ask is that you don’t speculate because not everyone has children and can understand what this means. 
A story on Buzzfeed shares the couple’s statement, in which the singer asks for privacy as he and his family fight this battle. 
According to BuzzFeed , the Argentinian newspaper La Nacion reported that Noah was initially taken to the doctor for a suspected case of the mumps and was subsequently diagnosed with cancer, every parent’s worst nightmare. 
As Bublé said in his post, “We are devastated about the recent cancer diagnosis of our oldest son Noah who is currently undergoing treatment in the US. We have always been very vocal about the importance of family and the love we have for our children.” A photo posted by Michael Bublé (@michaelbuble) on Oct 16, 2016 at 7:25am PDT 
It seems clear that this isn’t a family that will take this situation lying down. Noah’s cancer is in for a fight. 
The battle won’t be easy, especially since childhood cancer research is woefully underfunded. The St Baldrick’s Foundation states that only 4% of cancer research is devoted to childhood cancer, despite the fact that, according to Dr. Eugenie Kleinerman, head of the division of pediatrics at the Children’s Cancer Hospital at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, “Curing childhood cancer is the equivalent of curing breast cancer in terms of productive life years saved.” 
Bublé and his wife are putting their careers on hold to tend to their son, and expressing hope that, with the “support of family, friends and fans around the world, we will win this battle, God willing.” 
Recently, the singer had expressed his joy at being a dad, telling Entertainment Tonight , “The only regret that I have in my life is that I took this long to have kids, because I had no idea the perspective it would give me. I had no idea how much I would love being a dad.” 
And now he has to face that hardest battle any parent could imagine. Hopefully, that love will be enough, and his son will pull through. Vanquishing Viruses – 10 Natural Antiviral Remedies

20221,20221,"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is dead, Schumer tells labor leaders",Kaitlyn Stegall,"November 11, 2016 The Trans-Pacific Partnership is dead, Schumer tells labor leaders 
The Senate’s soon-to-be top Democrat told labor leaders Thursday that the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal at the center of President Obama’s “pivot” to strengthen ties with key Asian allies, will not be ratified by Congress. 
That remark from Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is expected to be the incoming Senate minority leader, came as good news to the AFL-CIO Executive Council, which met Thursday in Washington. Schumer relayed statements that Republican congressional leaders had made to him, according to an aide who confirmed the remarks. 
Obama’s signature global trade deal had been on life support for months as both Democrats and Republicans campaigned against unfair trade policies ahead of the Nov. 8 election. And Donald Trump’s triumph in the presidential race cemented its fate. 
“There is no way to fix the TPP,” Trump said in a June economic address. “We need bilateral trade deals. We do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down.”",1
20222,20222,Why Corporate America Is Leaving the Suburbs for the City - The New York Times,Nelson D. Schwartz,"WILMINGTON, Del.  —   For decades, many of the nation’s biggest companies staked their futures far from the fraying downtowns of aging East Coast and Midwestern cities. One after another, they decamped for sprawling campuses in the suburbs and exurbs. Now, corporate America is moving in the other direction. In June, McDonald’s joined a long list of companies that are returning to downtown Chicago from suburbs like Oak Brook, Northfield and Schaumburg. Later this month, the top executive team at General Electric  —   whose   wooded campus in Fairfield, Conn. has embodied the quintessential suburban corporate office park since it opened in 1974  —   will move to downtown Boston. When the move is completed in 2018, the renovated red brick warehouses that will form part of G. E.’s new headquarters won’t even have a parking lot, let alone a spot reserved for the chief executive. But even as they establish new urban beachheads, business giants like G. E. are also changing the nature of their headquarters, staffing them with a few top   employees and a smattering of digital talent, rather than recreating the endless   pods they once built in the ’burbs. “Part of it is that cities are more attractive places to live than they were 30 years ago and are more willing to provide tax incentives, and young people want to be there,” said David J. Collis, who teaches corporate strategy at Harvard Business School. “But the trend also represents the deconstruction and disaggregation of the traditional corporate headquarters,” he explained. “The executive suite might be downtown, but you could have the back office and administrative functions in Colorado, the finance guys in Switzerland and the tax team in the U. K. ” Reinforcing the trend, Chemours plans to announce on Tuesday that it is staying here in Wilmington after considering suburban locations, most likely in the   headquarters it inherited from DuPont when the chemical giant spun out Chemours last year. Unlike Chicago and Boston, Wilmington’s urban renaissance remains a work in progress, and Chemours was very close to moving to a new home in southern New Jersey or suburban Philadelphia, despite the DuPont family’s deep roots in Wilmington and the state of Delaware. But the company’s chief executive, Mark Vergnano, ultimately came to the same conclusion that leaders of bigger and   firms did: To attract younger workers, it helps to be in the city. “We are going through a change in our work force, and we wanted to be where we could attract millennials,” Mr. Vergnano said. “This is a group that likes to be in an urban setting, with access to public transportation. They don’t want to be confined to a building with a cafeteria or be next door to a shopping center. ” To be sure, cash from the State of Delaware and other incentives played an important role in the decision as well. In addition to providing Chemours, which produces a range of industrial chemical products, with a $7. 9 million package of grants, Delaware overhauled its corporate tax code, sacrificing revenue and easing the company’s tax burden as an added lure to stay put. For Wilmington, where the unemployment rate of 5. 7 percent is above both the national average and Delaware’s overall 4. 2 percent level of joblessness, keeping Chemours’s 800 headquarters jobs in the city counts as a major win. “In a more perfect world, states would be competing on the quality of schools, infrastructure, work force and so forth,” said Gov. Jack A. Markell of Delaware. “We live in a world that’s not perfect, so if other states are competing on the basis of these dollar incentives, we need to be in the same arena. ” In an era of relentless   many corporate moves these days coincide with downsizing. Kraft Heinz, for example, had 2, 200 workers when the company was based in Northfield it has 1, 500 now in downtown Chicago. With advanced communications tools making it easier than ever to separate headquarters from other corporate operations, location is increasingly being driven by function. The first 175 members of G. E.’s management team, including Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, will move to Boston’s Fort Point section on Aug. 22. Even after the move is completed, about 800 G. E. employees will be based there. Hundreds of other workers in   functions like human resources, legal and finance will be scattered among G. E’s existing locations in Cincinnati, Norwalk, Conn. and Schenectady, N. Y. The headquarters of Motorola Solutions will start moving to downtown Chicago on Aug. 15, though more workers will stay in suburban Schaumburg than move to the new offices near Union Station. But for the first time in half a century, top executives from the company will again be in downtown Chicago. “Where you work really matters,” said Greg Brown, the chief executive of Motorola Solutions. “No disrespect to Schaumburg, but customers and new hires didn’t want to come to the suburbs an hour outside of Chicago. We wanted energy, vibrancy and diversity, and to accelerate a change in our culture by moving downtown. ” Mr. Brown and most of the executive team will be in the city, along with data scientists and design engineers workaday functions like procurement, training and supply chain management will stay in Schaumburg. Over all, Motorola Solutions will have 1, 100 employees in downtown Chicago, and 1, 600 still in Schaumburg. Unlike many other corporate migrants, the company did not receive any financial incentives to move, Mr. Brown said. “This was the right thing in terms of strategy,” he said. “Millennials want the access and vibrancy of downtown. When we post jobs downtown, we get four or five times the response. ” As for G. E. executives were focused on moving to a city from the beginning of its search for a new headquarters, said Ann R. Klee, director of Boston operations and development for the company. Along with eliminating the parking lot (workers are being encouraged to use public transit) G. E. wanted to do away with security gates and the sense of isolation that characterizes many corporate campuses. “This is going to be the exact opposite,” Ms. Klee said. “We want it to be open and to bring the public in with a museum and exhibits of technology like   printers. ” Besides   icons like G. E. McDonald’s and Kraft Heinz, venture capital investors and   are increasingly looking to urban centers, particularly on the West Coast, said Richard Florida, an urban theorist and professor at the University of Toronto. “The period of companies moving to suburbs and edge cities has ebbed, but I had thought that   would continue to locate in   nerdistans, like office parks,” he said. But a recent study by Mr. Florida showed more than half of new venture capital flowing into urban neighborhoods, with two San Francisco ZIP codes garnering more than $1 billion each, he said. The return of a top echelon of executives to American cities reflects  —   and may well reinforce  —   disparities driven by widening inequality, underscoring how jobs are disappearing in other locales. Over all, there has been a slight pickup in employment and population in the central core of big cities, said Joel Kotkin, an author and urban geographer at Chapman University in California. But many   suburbs and neighborhoods are withering, particularly in the Northeast. More distant suburbs and exurbs are still thriving, especially in the Sun Belt. “The elite functions are going downtown,” Mr. Kotkin said. “But at the same time,   jobs are moving to the suburbs in places like Dallas, if they’re not leaving the country entirely. ” In Wilmington, local shopkeepers were elated that Chemours decided not to follow its former corporate parent, DuPont, to the suburbs. “Anybody who has a business in downtown Wilmington doesn’t want to lose Chemours,” said Leonard Simon, whose   men’s clothing store, Wright  Simon, has been around the corner from Chemours since 1952. “I’m thrilled. ” Jeffrey C. Flynn, director of economic development for Wilmington, said that the advantages of city life ultimately proved to be a compelling selling point. “We’re not Philadelphia,” Mr. Flynn said, “but we do have an urban atmosphere. ”",0

This can sometimes be a torturous realization for me as I contemplate eating something that I know will not serve my body, mind, and spirit well. But if only it were that simple — merely having to decide between a cookie or a piece of fruit, rather than trying to understand how their ingredients may help or harm me. advertisement - learn more Labels in particular are one giant headache, but they can also make a world of difference between choosing a good food and a bad one. Labels on the majority of packaged foods need to meet strict requirements, relaying important information for people with food allergies, exposing food additives, and offering food storage instructions. But with the plethora of food labels out there, how can one keep up? It’s not even a matter of whether you can or not, or even want to or not; you simply need to know what you are putting in your body. We all shop for food, and as we do, whether it be online or in the store, we come across so many ingredients, brands, and ultimately, labels. There’s “cage free” and “humane certification,” there’s “natural”and “no antibiotics,” and then there’s “organic.” All of these labels can tell you important information about how animals are fed and handled, how crops are grown, and even how the workers are treated. They say ignorance is bliss, but when it comes to your health and humanity, the saying doesn’t always hold up. Have you ever seen a video online, listened to a descriptive story, or watched a full-length documentary about the way our food is made and by whom, and been utterly turned off, disgusted, or even beside yourself with anxiety and sadness? There’s a reason such exposures exist: to make people wake up and realize that the system isn’t as cut and dry as healthy and unhealthy. So when it comes to labels, while it can seem like far too much information to comprehend, it remains our duty to ourselves and to our families to learn what each signifies. And it doesn’t even have to be that difficult. advertisement - learn more Ghergich & Co. teamed up with Woodside to create an infographic on food labels in the hopes that they could easily share a go-to guide for consumers to understand exactly what the labels on the food they’re considering buying mean. They cover terms like cage free, certified humane, free range, free roaming, grass fed, and wild caught. Certified Fair Trade products, for instance, are made in safe and healthy working conditions. Both the farmers and producers receive a fair price and have a voice in how their workplace is run. “Natural,” on the other hand, doesn’t necessarily hold up to what consumers may assume. While these products don’t contain artificial ingredients or added colour and are minimally processed, growth hormones can still be used, they’re not always organic, and they don’t require that animals are raised in open space, either. Take a closer look at the following infographic to learn some valuable truths and important information for you to consider the next time you go grocery shopping.

20224,20224,Hillary Is The Perfection of a Corrupt System,Charles Hugh Smith,"
Exposing the Clintons’ perfection of a corrupt political system won’t change the conditions and incentives that created the Clintons’ harvester of corruption. 
Let’s set aside Hillary Clinton as an individual and consider her as the perfection of a corrupt political system. As I noted yesterday, Politics As Usual Is Dead , and Hillary Clinton is the ultimate product of the political system that is disintegrating before our eyes.
The corruption of pay-to-play and the commingling of public and private influence is not the failing of an individual–it is the logical conclusion of a thoroughly corrupt political system.
Given the incentives built into politics as usual , public/private pay-to-play doesn’t just make sense–it is the only possible maximization of the political system .
Cobble together a multi-million dollar private foundation, millions of dollars in speaking fees from big-money contributors, conflicts of interest, the secrecy of private email servers, pay-to-play schemes and corrupted loyalists planted in the Department of Justice, and the inevitable result is a politics as usual money-harvesting machine that lays waste to the nation, supporters and critics alike.
All the Clintons did is assemble the parts more effectively than anyone else. Now that the machine has scooped up hundreds of millions of dollars in “contributions” and other loot, vested interests and corrupted loyalists within the federal government will do anything to protect the machine and its vast flow of funds.
The nation’s political system needs a thorough cleaning from top to bottom. Exposing the Clintons’ perfection of politics as usual won’t change the conditions and incentives that created the Clintons’ harvester of corruption.
That will require rooting out the incentives that made the Clintons’ perfection of corruption both logical and inevitable. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

20226,20226,Earth’s Magnetic Field is Collapsing — Are the Poles About to Switch?,Editor,"As it turns out – according to studies— our planets magnetic field could flip in our lifetime. According to experts , the position of the South Pole has shifted and is not located precisely at Antarctica, the North Pole is also believed to be ‘racing’ across the Arctic Ocean. Earth’s magnetic field appears to be collapsing which could severely damage our climate and WIPE OUT power grids across the world. 
Our planet’s magnetic field exists because Earth has a massive ‘ball of iron’ at its core which is surrounded by an outer layer of molten metal.
As the earth’s magnetic field varies over time, the positions of the north and south magnetic poles gradually change. The magnetic declination at a given location also changes over time. As it turns out a lot has changed in the last couple of hundred years, and to see what we are taking about visit NOAA and take a look at Historical Magnetic Declination .

Interestingly, according to previous studies, Earth’s magnetic field – which shields our planet from blasts of deadly solar radiation has dangerously weakened in the last couple of years.
According to reports from the European Space Agency , the biggest weak spots seen in the magnetic field are located in the western hemisphere.
Experts are unsure why the magnetic field is weakening but one of the MOST LIKELY reasons is that our planets magnetic poles are getting ready to flip said Rune Floberghagen, the ESA’s Swarm mission manager.
Researchers have concluded that the magnetic field had diminished at a rate of around five percent per century. However, new studies who that the magnetic field is weakening at an accelerated rate of five percent per decade –meaning that it is deteriorating five times faster than previously believed.
If we take a look at the animation of secular variation in geomagnetic total intensity for the last 400 years, we will see that the magnetic field began weakening in 1600 .
Animation of secular variation in geomagnetic total intensity for the last 400 years: 
Furthermore, the magnetic field weakened a staggering 10 percent from the 1800’s to 2000.
Ok so… what would happen if it really flips? According to experts, if the pole switch does happen the entire planet and everything on it will become exposed to solar winds which could punch giant holes into the ozone layer which in turn could have a devastating effect on mankind. If the planet’s Magnetosphere starts collapsing power grids could collapse, the weather would abruptly change and humans would have serious health risks.
According to reports from the European Space Agency, as of 2014 the magnetic field is continuing to weaken rapidly . With the help of SWARM, scientists have obtained unprecedented insights into the complex workings of Earth’s magnetic field. Reports show that the general trend of the magnetic field is weakening and the most dramatic declines are present over the Western Hemisphere.

The latest measurements also confirm the movement of magnetic North towards Siberia. It is believed that the magnetic field is speeding away at a rate of about 40 miles per year.
But what is most terrifying is perhaps a study that warns that magnetic reversals lead to extinction events. The highlights of the study indicate :
Geomagnetic field reversal substantially weakens the protection for the atmosphere. Solar wind energizes more oxygen ions to escape when geomagnetic field is weakened. Oxygen escape may explain the drop of atmospheric level during mass extinction. The causal relation between reversal and mass extinction should be “many-to-one”. The simulated oxygen escape rate based on knowledge of Mars support our hypothesis. Furthermore, it is believed that magnetic reversals can be responsible for floods of biblical proportions as you can see in the video below:

20227,20227,Is it possible that Saudi King be tried in US courts by JASTA Law?,nan,"Email 

According to the JASTA law which allows government and leaders of foreign governments’ harassment by families of victims of the terrorist attacks, it is so likely that Saudi king be tried. According to experts, the passing of JASTA may cause international chaos. Especially after some governments threat they will pass similar legislation to prosecute US officials if US do so. 
Is it possible that Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz being tried for potential liability in events of September 11? The trial is possible by the legislation of Jasta. By Jasta law the families of the victims could sue governments and this will lead to chaos in international relations. 
In late September, United States Congress ignored President Obama’s advice and his veto and passed JASTA law, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. This law made US-Saudi relation more chaotic. 
US confederate states expressed concern to JASTA legislation 
Not just Saudi Arabia expressed concerns to JASTA, US confederate states also expressed concern about breaking the US quasi-sacred treaty with Saudi Arabia and asked for appealing. France and the Netherlands have threatened to pass similar laws which lead to a series of judicial complaints against USA and its military and diplomacy allies. 
John Kerry, United States Secretary of State, showed his displeasure and called it a huge risk. A few days ago Kerry and Adel al-Jubeir discussed about the ramifications of JASTA and pointed out the negative impact on the diplomatic immunity of US interests. He said: “there are ways to fix the problem.” While experts agreed that it is only possible to reduce the strength of America in complaining by circumvent the law. 
Even Saudi minister warned the danger of chaos in the international system. 
According to Hussein ibish, an expert on the Persian Gulf littoral states, JASTA will cause chaos at the international level. 
Last September, European Union warned: “Other countries may also want to pass similar legislation and discuss impunity. This threat was an addition written letters to US government. 
Also France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom representatives discussed about the feedback of this law. The Gulf littoral states, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Pakistan and Japan Protested against JASTA. 
The Saudi-US Relations in danger of Jasta 
Bernard Haykel, Princeton University Professor, said: “If Saudi king does not appear in New York court to be interrogated, warrant will be issued against Saudi Arabia.” Riyadh and Washington relations declined over the past three years especially with Obama's policies on Syria.” JASTA shows Saudi ruling that Obama turned his back to its allies in the Middle East,” he added. 
Riyadh strictly denies his involvement in 9/11, While 15 of the 19 were from Saudi Arabia. Turki al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence, also comments:” America wants to invade his most loyal friend over the past 70 years.” 
Jasta law does not refer to Saudi Arabia. It would allow families of the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks to sue the perpetrators of the attack.",1
20228,20228,Stephen Hawking: Mankind Will Have to Populate Another Planet Within 100 Years to Survive - Breitbart,Charlie Nash,"Physicist, cosmologist, and author Stephen Hawking has predicted that mankind will have to populate another planet within 100 years to survive. [Hawking made the prediction in an upcoming documentary titled Expedition New Earth, which the BBC has teased with Hawking’s comments.  “Professor Stephen Hawking thinks the human species will have to populate a new planet within 100 years if it is to survive,” reiterated the BBC in a statement. “With climate change, overdue asteroid strikes, epidemics and population growth, our own planet is increasingly precarious. ” Hawking has become known for his futurist predictions, in 2014 he also claimed that “the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. ” Michael Guillen Ph. D. a former science editor for ABC News, disputed Hawking’s prediction in an article for Fox News, claiming that the author has “become a    celebrity, who’s flung off the chains of academic rigor to make sensational pronouncements. ” “Does Stephen really expect to be taken seriously? I doubt it,” Guillen proclaimed. “Despite everything, he is too smart for that. My impression is he’s become the Donald Trump of science, given to saying outrageous things for the fun of it and to attract attention. ” “Apart from being spectacularly unscientific, his prophecy is also wrongheaded,” he continued. “Hawking says we ought to escape to Mars. Interestingly, some scientists think   once lived on the Red Planet. But a global catastrophe produced what we see today, a moribund world lacking a thick,   atmosphere  —   wanting for greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, to keep warm. ” Guillen added that “Winter temperatures can dip below minus 195 degrees Fahrenheit and summer temperatures barely reach 70 degrees,” before declaring that “for the adventure, I’d go to Mars this minute.

20229,20229,Obamas Make Book Deal With Penguin Random House - The New York Times,Alexandra Alter,"Penguin Random House will publish coming books by former President Barack Obama and the former first lady Michelle Obama, the publishing company announced Tuesday night, concluding a heated auction among multiple publishers. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but publishing industry executives with knowledge of the bidding process said it probably stretched well into eight figures. Robert B. Barnett and Deneen C. Howell of Williams  Connolly represented the Obamas. Penguin Random House acquired world rights to the books, and worldwide sales could be substantial. No decision has been made yet as to which of the company’s major imprints  —   which include Random House, Doubleday, Alfred A. Knopf and Crown  —   will publish the books. Mr. Obama’s previous books were published by Crown, which also published Mrs. Obama’s book “American Grown,” about the White House garden. A spokeswoman for Penguin Random House would not say whether the books would be memoirs and referred questions to representatives of the Obamas. Speculation about the Obamas’ books and how much they would sell for have been circulating in the industry in recent weeks, as executives at the top publishing houses met separately with the former president and first lady. Some publishing executives who followed the bidding process said that the opening offers for Mr. Obama’s book alone were in the $18 million to $20 million range. The publisher plans to donate one million books in the Obama family’s name to First Book, a nonprofit organization that provides books to disadvantaged children, and it will continue to provide digital copies to Open eBooks, which grew out of the 2016 White House digital education initiative. The Obamas also plan to donate part of their advances to charity, including the Obama Foundation. “We are absolutely thrilled to continue our publishing partnership with President and Mrs. Obama,” Markus Dohle, the chief executive of Penguin Random House, said in a statement. “With their words and their leadership, they changed the world, and every day, with the books we publish at Penguin Random House, we strive to do the same. Now, we are very much looking forward to working together with President and Mrs. Obama to make each of their books global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance. ” The Obamas’ advance is likely to exceed even the stratospheric figures that other recent presidents and first ladies have received. Former president Bill Clinton sold his memoir “My Life” for more than $10 million, and Hillary Clinton reportedly received an $8 million advance from Simon  Schuster for her memoir “Living History. ” George W. Bush’s memoir “Decision Points,” became a hit, selling about two million copies and earning him an estimated $10 million. (Mr. Barnett, a   lawyer, has handled many of these lucrative deals and represents some of the capital’s most powerful players, including the Clintons Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura Bush Speaker Paul D. Ryan and former Vice President Dick Cheney.) It is unusual, however, for a former president and first lady to make a collective deal for their memoirs, and some publishing industry insiders said that early on the process, it appeared that the books were going to be auctioned separately. (It is possible, and perhaps likely, that the books will be published by different imprints in the Penguin Random House conglomerate, which could also help the company absorb the cost of a large advance, by sharing it between imprints.) Mr. Obama has a proven track record in publishing as an author of multiple best sellers. His three books  —   “Dreams From My Father,” “The Audacity of Hope” and “Of Thee I Sing”  —   have sold more than four million copies. According to financial disclosures, he earned more than $10 million from those titles. Reviews have praised him as a gifted prose stylist. But a postpresidential memoir has even greater potential to be a critical and commercial hit. Mr. Obama kept a journal during his time in office, which suggests his memoir could include    moments that were captured as major events unfolded. A frank discussion of his time in the White House, and of issues like race relations in America, could reach an even wider audience, becoming a worldwide blockbuster. Penguin Random House, a global publishing house with more than 250 imprints, has worldwide rights to the books, which means the company can make a good deal of money overseas and in translation. For the Obamas, the books may be valuable beyond the   advances. The deal was announced, probably coincidentally but somewhat awkwardly, on the night that President Trump gave his first address before Congress. These books could provide a chance to reframe and highlight the former president’s legacy, at a moment when a new Republican administration is making an effort to dismantle some of his signature legislation.",0
20230,20230,Trump is The Lesser Evil Because Hes Such a Narcissist      :,Prof. Michael Hudson," Trump is The Lesser Evil Because Hes Such a Narcissist By Prof. Michael Hudson
She a vindictive dictator, punishing her enemies, appointing neocons
Well, both Hillary and Donald Trump say the election is about the lesser evil. So, if thats true, whos the greater evil? Posted November 08, 2016
Ross Ashcroft: Youve got two candidates in the U.S. and one is very pro-Wall Street, specifically Goldman Sachs. She might as well be on the payroll. In fact, she is on the payroll. And the other is a rent-seeker -in-chief, and hes built real estate and used the banks. So youve got Trump and youve got Clinton. Both of them are in bed with Wall Street, fundamentally. But the people get it now.
Michael Hudson: Well, I think Hillary Clinton has a 79 percent disapproval rating, and Trump has an 81 percent disapproval rating. So you have the two most unpopular politicians in the United States as the choice. So basically, the voters in the United States are given a choice: Yes,Yes, please, and Yes, thank you. I think Trump missed his big chance to make a populist push. Instead of saying hes going to cut taxes on Wall Street, he can say, Look, I stiffed the banks. I went bankrupt four or six times. I screwed the banks and they didnt get paid and I can screw the banks for you people. Vote for me. I know how to do it.
Ashcroft: Yes, hes missed that.
Hudson: I think that would have been his winning ploy.
Ashcroft: You should be his campaign strategist.
Hudson: Well, except I dont think Id have many friends if I worked for Donald Trump. And we dont know that if he agreed with me today what hed do tomorrow. Thats part of the problem. He doesnt play well with colleagues.
Ashcroft: You sort of prefer him thoughwould that be right? Because he doesnt play well with colleagues, because hes awkward, because hes a loner, becausebecause youre saying you dont want a resourceful, intelligent and influential type in the job because the jobs so powerful.
Hudson: Well, both Hillary and Donald Trump say the election is about the lesser evil. So, if thats true, whos the greater evil? Hillary has a whole crowd behind herthe neocons, who basically want to be very confrontational toward Russia and continue what she was doing in Libya to Syriamilitarily confrontational. Or you have Donald Trump, who doesnt really know who he can appoint and whether he can get enough people to work with him. So if the direction of America is to try to hold on to a unipolar worldmilitarily confrontationalyou want a president who is least able to do evil. And theres no question, Trump is the lesser evil because hes such a narcissist, and really sort of a blank slate. And Id rather take a pig in a poke than someone whoyou already know what Hillary will do. Shell do what the husband does. And itsthe Clintons have corrupted the Democratic Party. Thats what Bernie Sanders ran on against her
Ashcroft: And did very well.
Hudson: And did very well. But then he didnt realize that there really cannot be any progress by the labor unions, or consumers, or the 99 percent as long as the Democratic Party is controlled totally by Wall Street and by the Robert Rubin gang that they brought in. And theyre really like a mafia gang. If you think the financial sector and the banking sector as crimeand after all, remember, theyve paid billions and billions of dollars in civil fines without a single banker being sent to jailthats what a criminal wants to do. When the criminals take control of the justice system and take over the police force and bribe the judgesall the Hollywood movies in the 1930s were thatthen youve got the criminals in control. And youve got the financial sector criminalized. Thats what my colleague Bill Black at the University of Missouri at Kansas City has been emphasizing, and hes convinced all of us that the business plan of the big banksCitibank, Bank of America, weve just got, and Wells Fargo, with all of the huge frauds that are coming outthat was their business plan: fraud. And people are afraid to say that fraud is banking. Theyre afraid to say just exactly what the evidence is because its considered impolite to talk about reality.
Ashcroft: What sort of president then will Hillary Clinton be?
Hudson: A dictator. She a vindictive dictator, punishing her enemies, appointing neocons in the secretary of state, in the defense department, appointing Wall Street people in the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, and the class war will really break out very explicitly. And shellas Warren Buffet said, there is a class war and were winning it.
Ashcroft: As in the one percent are winning it.
Hudson: The one percent are winning it. And she will try to use the rhetoric to tell people: Nothing to see here folks. Keep on moving, while the economy goes down and down and she cashes in as shes been doing all along, richer and richer, and if shes president, there will not be an investigator of the criminal conflict of interest of the Bill Clinton Foundation, of pay-to-play. Youll have a presidency in which corporations who pay the Clintons will be able to set policy. Whoever has the money to buy the politicians will buy control of policy because elections have been privatized and made part of the market economy in the United States. Thats what the Citizens United Supreme Court case was all about.
Ashcroft: So thats another example of rent-seeking.
Hudson: Yes, political payoffs. And thats the largest rent-seeking of all. Basically, for paying one penny, you get a whole dollars worth of special privileges. And rent is really payment for a privilege. Its for a privilege thats created from the private sector. And basically as Balzac said, every great fortune originates in a great theft that isnt considered a great theft anymore because its all viewed as part of the market. Its viewed as if thats how the world works. So youll have a theft taking place and the Clintons will say, Thats just how the world operates and GDP is going up because were getting richer, enough to offset the degree by which you 99 percent are getting poor.",1

20232,20232,"Life: After 55 Years Of Research, Jane Goodall Shares Her 6 Most Fascinating Discoveries About Chimpanzees",nan,"Email Jane Goodall has dedicated her life to studying primates, and the insights she has gained into our evolutionary ancestors are truly powerful. Prepare to have your breath taken away by Dr. Goodall’s words. 
1. Chimps will betray their own to get their hands on Italian food: “As with all chimps, the ones I studied in Gombe were absolutely obsessed with Italian food and would go to extraordinary lengths to get their hands on some. One day, the troop’s alpha male, whom I called Goliath, managed to acquire a plate of linguine. Humphrey, a younger male, saw Goliath’s linguine and became incredibly jealous. He offered to give Goliath his most prized possession—a vacant hornet nest that he enjoyed having sex with—in exchange for the linguine, but Goliath declined, as he already had a hornet nest of his own. Desperate to eat the linguine, Humphrey threw some pebbles to divert Goliath’s attention, then snuck up behind him and ripped his head off, allowing him to take the Italian food from his superior. It was a gruesome yet utterly fascinating scene.” 
2. When chimpanzee communities encounter a Japanese researcher, they will try to put them in jail: “My colleague, Dr. Kiyoshi Yamamoto, discovered this when chimps dragged him from his tent in the middle of the night down to the local prison. The apes would then approach the town’s sheriff with their hands out, expecting a food reward. It was truly shocking to learn that chimpanzees are capable of such things. Nature is not always pretty.” 
3. Most chimps can vocalize the phrase “oh no”: “They like to yell it while they defecate.” 4. Chimps don’t like it when you blow up one of their family members with a grenade: “One of my young researchers, Sofia Manfredi, discovered this after rolling an active grenade into a ditch where several male siblings were sharing a lunch of termites and soup. The grenade exploded the youngest one into a red mist of viscera and bone, and, curiously, the other brothers seemed to become rather disheartened.” 
5. Chimps revere hippos: “When they become aware of a hippo in the vicinity, chimps stop whatever they’re doing and take turns honoring the beast. They bring offerings of plump salamanders, crushed soda cans, and other treasures they’ve found in the dirt, and they join together in an angelic chorus of growls to soothe the hippo. New mothers will rub their infants against the hippo’s groin to bless them with his virility. The troop’s elders will break off their incisors with a rock and fashion a crude crown of teeth for the hippo to wear. If the hippo becomes aggressive towards them, they do not resist; in fact, it is an honor for them to be crushed by the hippo, and they will often place their heads on the ground next to his hooves in hopes that he might accidentally stomp their skulls flat.” 
6. If a chimp dunks its head into a bucket of horchata for an hour, it will die: “Whenever chimps discover a large pail of horchata in the forest, the eldest female of the group will approach it and slowly lower her head into the liquid, remaining there for an hour or more until another chimp yanks her out of it. It was fascinating to observe the way their social structure altered afterwards, with the next eldest female unfailingly rising up to lead the group’s children in licking the sweet rice milk from their deceased matriarch’s body.”",1
20233,20233,Storm That Roared Through the South Sweeps Into the Northeast - The New York Times,Nate Schweber and Eli Rosenberg,"The storm that devastated parts of the South over the weekend swept into the Northeast with strong gusts of wind and heavy rain, knocking down power lines and tree branches, flooding some coastal towns and disrupting transit across the region. By Tuesday morning, the worst of the storm had passed. The damage was significantly less than the storm’s southern passage, which left at least 20 people dead, including 15 in Georgia. On the Jersey Shore, flooding closed some roads in places like Wildwood, Atlantic City and Sea Bright. Photographs and videos shared on social media showed water pooling in and outside of the Hoboken Terminal. On the South Shore of Long Island, rain flooded the streets in Freeport and Lindenhurst. Some New Jersey school districts were closed or delayed opening on Tuesday because of the weather. In New York, small sections of the Belt Parkway, Van Wyck Expressway and   Expressway were flooded briefly. Power failures were reported in parts of Long Island, New Jersey, Staten Island and Queens. Wind speeds of more than 60 miles per hour in New Jersey and about 40 m. p. h. in New York prompted warnings from city officials on Monday, but the wind tapered significantly by Tuesday morning. The storm surge caused water to rise about     feet in New York, which officials described as mild. About 70 to 80 trees were blown down, said Nancy Silvestri, a spokeswoman for the New York City Emergency Management Department. “There are no major impacts from either last night’s high tide period or this morning,” Ms. Silvestri said. Residents from around the region spoke about the inconveniences and less about damage: The memory of hurricane Sandy, which caused a storm surge of more than 10 feet in places and left behind significantly more destruction, loomed larger. Sam Patel, owner of a Welsh Farms convenience store in Asbury Park, N. J. said the electricity went out a few times Monday night but came back on within five minutes. The wind also ripped off a piece of his storm gutter, which he refastened with tape. “All day the gusts were just like the classic hurricane type,” he said. “You could hear the rattling of the gutters, the hissing. ” What spared the area, he said, was that the rain was not particularly heavy. In Monmouth Beach, N. J. some flooded streets were blocked off with orange traffic cones. Tattered flags shook on flagpoles in a wind that had yet to fully dissipate on Tuesday morning. Toppled trash cans dotted main commercial streets. In Lindenhurst, Long Island, high tide peaked around 7:20 a. m. The canal used for crabbing and swimming in the summertime had overflowed into the road. Curbs disappeared under the pooled water. The six inches of floodwater did not reach the levels left by Hurricane Sandy, when “you could go kayaking in the streets,” said Darren Greene, 13, waiting for a bus to take him to school. He was not entirely confident about when, or if, the bus would come. The road had been blocked off just past the stop. Michael Gandolfi, his wife and their    son were stuck at home in Lindenhurst with about a foot of water in front of their house. So Mr. Gandolfi, 37, planned to use the day to play with his   boats. In the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, small bodies of water covered   roads. But the delivery crews, workers and early risers navigating the streets before dawn on Tuesday were not fazed. Alongside the loading docks of a Fairway Market grocery store, a pool of water formed the width of the street and about 50 yards long. “It’s like this any time it rains hard,” a Fairway employee said. A couple of drivers used a swath of the dry curb to pass, while a motorist in a   vehicle charged through the pool of water. Bruce Sullivan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, described the storm on Monday as a “strong nor’easter,” because of the high winds and heavy rain. The storm had deposited between an inch and an inch and a half of rain by Tuesday morning. Passengers at the region’s three major airports had faced long delays and cancellations on Monday. The weather forced the suspension of AirTrain service at Newark Liberty International Airport on Monday buses ran in its place. New Jersey Transit and Amtrak temporarily suspended service along some lines on Monday because of downed power lines. Two   systems contributed to the storm, Mr. Sullivan said. One, from the south, was weakening as another moved in from off the coast of the Delmarva Peninsula.",0

The underside of the skull (full set of images below) indicates that this artifact is bone, about 3 to 5 mm thick, and still has a stiff, grey, skin-like material attached to it. Note the very narrow foramen magnum aperture where presumably a very thin vertebral system once entered the skull. The adult hand indicates the size of the specimen, and note that it is relatively bilaterally symmetrical, and that the skull is greatly elongated.Though easy to state that it is a complex fake, the caretaker and those that presumably found it, along with other specimens, have no access to artisans or taxidermists that could have made them. The caretaker removed some of the bone from the underpart of the skull and exposed what is presumably marrow. This, as well as the bone and skin can be sampled for DNA and radiocarbon testing in prominent laboratories in North America that we are working with already. The television series Ancient Aliens has shown initial interest in the specimen, and more specimens like this, from the same location may soon be available for observation and study.

20235,20235,Trump Taps Hollywood’s Mnuchin for Treasury and Dines With Romney - The New York Times,"Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Binyamin Appelbaum and Maggie Haberman","WASHINGTON  —   Steven Mnuchin, a financier with deep roots on Wall Street and in Hollywood but no government experience, is expected to be named Donald J. Trump’s Treasury secretary as soon as Wednesday, people close to the transition say. Mr. Mnuchin, 53, was the national finance chairman for Mr. Trump’s campaign, and his selection would elevate a wealthy loyalist to a pivotal economic post. He began his career at Goldman Sachs, where he became a partner, before creating his own hedge fund, moving to the West Coast and entering the first rank of movie financiers by bankrolling hits like the “ ” franchise and “Avatar. ” If confirmed, Mr. Mnuchin would play a critical role in carrying out Mr. Trump’s promised economic policy changes, including the enactment of a large package of tax cuts, sweeping changes to foreign trade agreements and the fulfillment of a huge new infrastructure spending program. He could also help lead any efforts to roll back President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran and the administration’s opening to Cuba by reimposing sanctions on Tehran and Havana. Mr. Mnuchin’s selection fits uneasily with much of Mr. Trump’s campaign attacks on the financial industry. Mr. Trump, in a campaign ad intended as a closing argument, portrayed the chief executive of Goldman Sachs as the personification of a global elite that the ad said had “robbed our working class. ” The selection of Mr. Mnuchin (pronounced   ) came as Mr. Trump moved on Tuesday to fill the ranks of his domestic policy team with seasoned Washington insiders chosen to help smooth the way in Congress for his two marquee campaign promises: the repeal of Mr. Obama’s health insurance coverage law and the large package to repair infrastructure, which could reach $1 trillion. Mr. Trump also took time Tuesday night to have dinner with Mitt Romney, whose name has been mentioned as a potential secretary of state, and who has become a source of contention among members of the transition team. Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who called Mr. Trump a “phony” and a “fraud” during the Republican primaries, sat down for a   meal Tuesday night at   a   Michelin restaurant at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Manhattan. Mr. Romney emerged several hours later to heap compliments on the   who has bristled privately that Mr. Romney never apologized for insulting him during the race. There was no apology, but Mr. Romney said he had been impressed by Mr. Trump’s victory speech on election night, his transition effort and his personnel decisions. “He did something I tried to do and was unsuccessful in accomplishing: He won the general election,” Mr. Romney told reporters. The appointments on Tuesday included Elaine L. Chao  —   a veteran of past Republican administrations who is married to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader  —   as transportation secretary. She will be charged with steering the infrastructure initiative through a divided Congress and the federal bureaucracy. Mr. Trump also announced that he would nominate Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, a physician who has been a fierce opponent of the health care law, as his secretary of health and human services  —   tasked with leading his efforts to dismantle the measure. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump will announce Wilbur Ross, the billionaire investor, as his secretary of commerce, according to the transition team. The moves suggested that Mr. Trump was seeking experienced policy makers who have deep relationships in Washington to shepherd his most sweeping pledges. In Ms. Chao, Mr. Trump is turning to a former secretary of labor under President George W. Bush. Her experience on Capitol Hill will be necessary to take on what will have to be a bipartisan infrastructure effort in Congress. Aides said Mr. Trump’s choice of Mr. Price underscored the  ’s commitment to move swiftly  —   as early as his first day in office  —   to roll back the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement, and replace it. Ms. Chao, who was born in Taiwan, brings a third woman to   positions in a Trump administration and an additional degree of diversity to the  ’s team, so far filled largely with conservative white men who have scoffed at political convention. Democrats said they were cautiously optimistic about working with Ms. Chao to forge a bipartisan infrastructure deal. “I hope Secretary Chao shares that ambitious goal and is willing to work with Democrats to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of   jobs along the way,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who is set to become the new minority leader. But Ms. Chao was quickly criticized by liberal groups who said she was emblematic of the very   political establishment Mr. Trump had promised to dismantle. Some policy analysts argued that as labor secretary she had inadequately protected employee rights, and the Center for American Progress called her selection an “ominous sign for workers. ” The selection of Mr. Price, who has served in Congress since 2005, revealed deeper partisan divisions. Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, called Mr. Price “a brilliant choice,” adding, “I’m glad that we’ll have a doctor who knows health care inside and out leading the way. ” But Democrats and their allies voiced alarm. Richard J. Fiesta, the executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, which represents retired union members, said he was “horrified” by the selection of Mr. Price. Marcia D. Greenberger, a president of the National Women’s Law Center, a research and advocacy group, said Mr. Price “would have a devastating impact on women’s health. ” In Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump has an ally whose nomination is expected to be well received on Wall Street, a number of traders and bankers contacted on Tuesday said. Since Mr. Trump’s victory, United States equity markets have hit record highs, with financial institutions leading the way. Having a Treasury secretary with broad experience as a financier is likely to sustain the view that a Trump administration will look favorably on Wall Street, not least in terms of pulling back some regulations put in place by Mr. Obama. Mr. Mnuchin was an early supporter of Mr. Trump. When Mr. Trump won New York’s Republican presidential primary contest in April, Mr. Mnuchin attended the victory party. The next day, he accepted Mr. Trump’s invitation to become the campaign’s national finance chairman. Mr. Mnuchin, the son of a Goldman Sachs partner, joined the firm after graduating from Yale. He worked there for 17 years, rising to oversee trading in government securities and mortgage bonds. He would be the third Goldman Sachs alumnus to serve as Treasury secretary, and the announcement of his appointment drew swift condemnation from liberal groups who said he had cashed in on the country’s financial collapse. “He purchased a   bank for pennies on the dollar and then aggressively foreclosed on tens of thousands of families,” Jon Green, a spokesman for the Take on Wall Street campaign, said in a statement. “Anyone concerned about Wall Street billionaires rigging the economy should be terrified by the prospect of a Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. ” The group was apparently referring to Mr. Mnuchin’s role in 2009 in a group that bought the failed California mortgage lender IndyMac from the government. He became the chairman of the company, renamed OneWest, which was ultimately sold to CIT, the nation’s largest   lender, in 2015 for more than twice the price the group had paid. During Mr. Mnuchin’s tenure, OneWest faced allegations that it had foreclosed improperly on some borrowers.   groups also filed a complaint with the federal government, claiming that OneWest was not meeting its legal obligation to make loans in minority neighborhoods. Mr. Mnuchin was the latest in a string of wealthy donors whom Mr. Trump has selected for top posts in his cabinet, including Mr. Ross Todd Ricketts, a Republican megadonor and an owner of the Chicago Cubs, who is expected to be the deputy commerce secretary and Betsy DeVos, a school choice activist and Republican   who he announced would be his education secretary. Mr. Mnuchin has conducted past business deals with the    —   but not always under the best of circumstances. Mr. Mnuchin’s hedge fund, Dune Capital Management, helped finance construction of a Trump project in Chicago. In 2008, Mr. Trump sued Dune and other lenders to extend the loan terms. The parties ultimately settled. The selections on Tuesday came as Mr. Trump huddled with advisers and potential cabinet officials in Trump Tower in Manhattan. Among the issues is whether Mr. Trump should name Mr. Romney as his secretary of state. After their dinner, Mr. Romney told reporters that Mr. Trump “continues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together, and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way. ” He said Mr. Trump’s conduct since winning the election gives “me increasing hope that   Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future. ”",0

Rand Paul ( ) said he wanted to know if presidential candidates were unmasked by the Obama administration for political purposes.  Paul said, “I’ve sent several letters to the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Intelligence Committee and also the White House asking political figures were presidential candidates unmasked by the Obama administration? If the Obama administration used intelligence for political purposes, this is a really, really serious abuse of power and must be investigated. There are rumors swirling about Susan Rice. There are rumors now swirling about Samantha Powers. So we need to know. Were they actually looking into people’s phone calls for political purposes? If that happened, really, we have to do something about it. We cannot live in fear of our own intelligence community. ” He continued, “We cannot have anybody in the intelligence community  —  they have such power to suck up every bit of every transmission of every communication we ever made   —  We can’t have them   releasing classified information to the public. ” He added, “We cannot live in fear of our own intelligence community. So, yes, absolutely from top to bottom we need a reform, and we need to go in and say the American people need to have oversight of this because we can’t let them listen to legislators phone calls or the president’s phone calls and blackmail the president.

20237,20237,Bathroom Case Puts Transgender Student on National Stage - The New York Times,Sheryl Gay Stolberg,"WASHINGTON  —   The bespectacled teenager in the gray A. C. L. U. hoodie and cargo pants stood, back pressed against a   fence on Pennsylvania Avenue, under a sign saying “No Trespassing, Authorized Personnel Only. ” The White House, illuminated at night, cast a glow over   who, having just wrapped up a protest against President Trump, waited in line to pay homage to    Gavin Grimm. Mr. Grimm looked a little flustered. “Absolutely humbled,” he pronounced himself, as his admirers thanked him for being brave. With Mr. Trump’s decision this week to rescind protections for transgender students that allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, the next stop is the Supreme Court, where Mr. Grimm  —   an engaging yet slightly awkward young man  —   is the lead plaintiff in a case that could settle the contentious “bathroom debate. ” Amid a thicket of conflicting state laws and local school policies on bathroom use, the suit, which pits Mr. Grimm against his school board in Gloucester County, Va. could greatly expand transgender rights  —   or roll them back. Mr. Trump has portrayed the issue as one of states’ rights, and already the country’s transgender students face differing realities depending on their school. Some are restricted to the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate. Others are not. Then there are the students like Mr. Grimm, who have had separate facilities set aside for them. At issue in Mr. Grimm’s case is whether Title IX, a provision in a 1972 law that bans discrimination “on the basis of sex” in schools that receive federal money, also bans discrimination based on gender identity. President Barack Obama concluded that it did. Despite Mr. Trump’s action, lawyers for both Mr. Grimm and the school board said Thursday that they expected the case to go forward, with oral arguments set for March 28 and school officials across the country awaiting the result. “No one was in a rush to bring this case to the Supreme Court,” said Joshua Block, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Mr. Grimm. “Gavin didn’t choose this fight this fight happened to Gavin. But now that we are here, lives are at stake, and they are at stake in a way that is even more acute because you don’t have a federal government anymore to protect us. ” For Mr. Grimm, who said he knew he was a boy “as soon as I was aware of the difference between boys and girls,” the case amounts to a crash course in government and media relations. It bears his initials, G. G. because he is a minor, and the name of his mother, Deirdre. At home in rural Gloucester, he is a kid with a pet pig named Esmeralda, a geek’s love of Pokémon cards and   Facebook friends. He wears $12 sneakers from Walmart and likes eating at Fuddruckers because the name sounds funny. He is applying for college, but doesn’t want to talk about it. But here in the nation’s capital and in big cities around the country, Mr. Grimm is now a hot property, the new face of the transgender rights movement. Laverne Cox, the actress and activist, gave him a public   at the Grammys. (“Everyone, please Google ‘Gavin Grimm,’” she said.) After his appearance here Wednesday night, he dashed off to New York to appear Thursday morning on ABC’s “The View. ” At the protest here Wednesday night, he was the star speaker, besieged with teary hugs and cellphone selfies. The mother of a transgender child burst into tears when she saw him. A government lawyer shook his hand. Activists posed for pictures. Suddenly, he is hearing his name mentioned in the same breath as Norma McCorvey, the eponymous plaintiff in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court case that established a national right to abortion (and who died last week) and Jim Obergefell, whose case led to the legalization of   marriage. Mr. Grimm looked   at the thought. “I just hope I do it justice,” he said quietly. When Mr. Grimm was about 12 or 13, he said, he was able to put a name to what he was feeling and recognized himself as transgender. He came out first to his friends, which was easier than telling his parents. For the family, it was a jolt, his mother said. It made her question preachers  —   she eventually left her church  —   but strengthened her faith. “God gave me this child to open my heart and my mind,” Mrs. Grimm, a nurse, said. In 2014, when Mr. Grimm was 15 and starting his sophomore year, the family told his school he was transgender. Administrators were supportive at first and allowed him to use the boys’ bathroom. But amid an uproar from some parents and students, and after two tense school board meetings, the board barred Mr. Grimm from using the boys’ bathrooms and instead adopted a policy requiring transgender youth to use separate “single user” restrooms. The school now has three such restrooms, but two are in refurbished utility closets, said Mr. Block, the A. C. L. U. lawyer. Kyle Duncan, a lawyer for the school board, said the board “agonized” as it sought a thoughtful way to accommodate Mr. Grimm while protecting students who felt uncomfortable. “This is a sensitive and difficult issue in which everyone’s privacy rights need to be respected,” he said. But Mr. Block said that Mr. Grimm had been singled out for “classic sex discrimination. ” Mrs. Grimm was more pointed: “This school board has targeted my child. ” Her son did not always have such aplomb. Before he began “living authentically,” his mother said, he was introverted, often retreating to his room. She winces at the times she tried to curl his hair and make him wear dresses. Mr. Grimm is, by all accounts, the perfect plaintiff, poised beyond his years. He knows how to deflect unwanted lines of questioning (he will not talk about his twin brother, friends or teachers) and is unfailingly polite in replying to intimate queries about his bathroom habits (“If I have to go, I go to the nurse’s restroom,” he told a local television reporter on Wednesday night) and his emotions (“It’s incredibly frustrating, it’s embarrassing, it’s very uncomfortable. I have this neon sign above my head that says I’m different from my peers”). But at heart, he is still a kid. Once, while touring the National Archives here, Mr. Grimm excitedly played Pokémon Go in front of the Declaration of Independence, as Bill Farrar, a spokesman for the A. C. L. U.’s Virginia affiliate, patiently tried to remind him that he was probably “the only person here who has a legal proceeding before the Supreme Court. ” The two have bonded over hours of travel, including a dash from Gloucester to Washington on Wednesday. Mr. Grimm stuffed his belongings in a white trash bag, sticking in a dress shirt at the last minute, which proved handy for “The View. ” Because Mr. Grimm is to graduate this year, it is unlikely that he will benefit if the court finds in his favor. And legal experts say that is a big if. The Supreme Court could rule narrowly, send the case back to the appeals court for further review, or decide to wait until similar suits percolate through the federal court system. And with just eight justices on the court  —   confirmation hearings for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, Mr. Trump’s nominee for the ninth seat, are scheduled to begin March 20  —   the justices might be inclined to wait. “There are many reasons not to resolve this issue now,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, who has followed the case. But Vanita Gupta, who ran the Civil Rights Division in Mr. Obama’s Justice Department and helped write the directive that Mr. Trump rescinded, said the Grimm case had already advanced the cause of transgender rights, just by raising awareness. “There has been such social and cultural change in the hearts and minds of people in this country,” she said, “and I think that’s only going to grow, even if there is a legal setback. ” Whatever happens, Mr. Grimm appears destined for a life of advocacy. He says he feels a heavy burden standing up for other transgender people, knowing that everyone is different. He worries that other young people will not have the support that he has had. While he is not much on school (he is taking only the two courses he needs to graduate) he would like to be a geneticist. He wants to know how the brain works. But asking him about his career plans brings a   answer  —   wry and pointed. “I want to be,” he said, “someone who doesn’t have to talk about where he is going to use the bathroom. ”",0
20238,20238,Obama on Dallas: No Reprise of ’60s Racial Strife - The New York Times,Mark Landler and Michael D. Shear,"WARSAW  —   President Obama expressed optimism on Saturday that the killings of young black men and white police officers this week have not left the United States as racially divided as it was during the strife and riots that racked the country in the 1960s. Speaking in Warsaw at the conclusion of a security summit meeting with European leaders, Mr. Obama said the United States had suffered “a tough week,” but he pledged to try to build upon good will among protesters and police officers alike. “There is sorrow, there is anger, there is confusion about next steps,” Mr. Obama said at the start of a news conference. “But there is unity in recognizing that this is not how we want our communities to operate. This is not who we want to be as Americans. ” The president said he would visit Dallas early next week to pay homage to the police officers who were killed there. And he said he would invite activists, police officials and others to the White House next week to seek “constructive actions that are actually going to make a difference. ” Mr. Obama acknowledged that the killings had unleashed some harsh speech, and he urged people of all points of view to be careful in how they express their opinions. But he said he believed that most people were simply saddened by the lives lost. “When we start suggesting that somehow there is this enormous polarization and we’re back to the situation in the 1960s  —   that’s just not true,” Mr. Obama said. “You’re not seeing riots, and you’re not seeing police going after people who are protesting peacefully. ” Asked to comment on how he will be remembered for dealing with racial issues, Mr. Obama said he would prefer to leave that question to historians. But he then continued to discuss, with some emotion, how he has sought to confront the divisive issue. He said he has tried to speak honestly about race in ways that he hoped would help people reach solutions. “More than anything, what I hope is that my voice has tried to get all of us as Americans to understand the difficult legacy of race,” Mr. Obama said. “If my voice has been true, and positive, then my hope would be that it may not fix everything right away, but it surfaces problems, it frames them, it allows us to wrestle with these issues,” he added. “I’d like to think that, as best as I could, I have been true in speaking about these issues. ” Mr. Obama deflected questions about the motives of the man who shot the police officers in Dallas. But he said whatever the motive might have been, people should not assume that the gunman speaks for Americans protesting police killings or anyone else. He said that the white individual who is charged in the shooting of nine black parishioners in South Carolina did not represent the views of all white Americans. And Mr. Obama said that people should not make the assumption that a “troubled Muslim individual” who engages in a shooting represents all Muslims. “I think the danger is that we somehow suggest that the act of a troubled individual speaks to some larger political statement across the country,” he said. “It doesn’t. ” The president also defended his mention of the need for new gun laws in the hours after the shooting in Dallas. He said the easy availability of guns in America was “a contributing factor” to the country’s gun violence. Critics have charged that Mr. Obama should not have raised what they say is a political issue in the moments after the shooting, calling it an insult to the memory of those killed and to the families of the dead who were still in the early stages of mourning. The president rejected that accusation and vowed to continue talking about the issue. “Part of what’s creating tensions between communities and police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere,” Mr. Obama said. “I’m not going to stop talking about it. ” The president noted that violent crime in the United States is significantly lower now than it has been in decades. But he acknowledged that people’s fears are understandable, especially in the wake of a terrorist attack or a gruesome killing captured on video. “We should never be satisfied when any innocent person is killed,” he said, “but that is not something that should be driving our anxieties, relative to where we have been in the past. ”",0

20240,20240,Killer Mike Proves Real Leaders are Truth-Tellers by Saying What Most People Won’t,WakingTimes,"Waking Times 
Politics in America has devolved into a contest of personalities, where policy, history, and reality are rejected in favor of style, skin color, gender and celebrity factor. This is unsurprising, though, in a nation that has for generations been weened on television and state indoctrination. We’ve been trained to look to politicians for leadership, but the real heroes and change makers in our world are the fearless truth-tellers who work to free our minds and inspire us to greatness by setting an example with their words and deeds. 
As we stare down the barrel of a critically divided society under the thumb of an all-powerful government and police state, righteous voices of non-partisan, no-bullshit truth who apply logic, common sense, and critical-thinking in defense of community and humanity are needed now more than ever. One such example is hip-hop artist, civic leader, social activist, and entrepreneur Michael Render, aka Killer Mike . His articulation of the problems we all face, accompanied with real ideas for meaningful action, make for an excellent reminder of what true leadership can look like. 
He’s done a ton of interviews in recent years, and although he mentions being a conservative, even advocating for the 2nd Amendment in response to public shootings, he played a big role in Bernie Sanders’ campaign for the Democratic nomination in an effort to help educate and awaken black voters. Consider the following clips of Killer Mike speaking on a number of today’s critical issues. 
Firstly, he talks to TMZ about the importance of participating in local elections and in using your vote to hold political parties accountable, while helping to see through the phony logic of voting for the lesser of two evils. 
“Scaring me with the boogie man is not going to work as effectively as giving my community something that helps.” ~Killer Mike 
In his song, ‘ Reagan, ‘ he rails against Obama, along with all the other authoritarian presidents we’ve had, as a member of an organization of war and profit, saying what so many Obama supporters are afraid to acknowledge. 
“Ronald Reagan was an actor, not at all a factor Just an employee of the country’s real masters Just like the Bushes, Clinton and Obama Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters If you don’t believe the theory, then argue with this logic Why did Reagan and Obama both go after Qaddafi We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby Same as in Iraq, and Afghanistan And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran They only love the rich, and how they loathe the poor If I say any more they might be at my door” 
~Killer Mike, Reagan 
As a leader in the black community, he is keenly aware of the affects of racism and police brutality today, but rather than advocating for protests or riots as an expression of justifiable anger, he breaks down how black people can overcome systemic corruption and racism by using the one weapon that is most effective in a capitalist culture: money. 
Furthermore, on the Bill Maher show on HBO , he goes into relationship between politicians and police, pointing out how politicians themselves use police as pawns. Final Thoughts 
The President of the United States of America is the figurehead of an authoritarian and corporatized organization that masquerades as benevolent, but POTUS is a puppet, not a leader. As Americans go at each other’s throats over about the election, it may serve us well to remember that individuals are the true leaders in our community and in our world. 
“My criteria is probably Libertarian views, where you just let the free market reign, you let people do what they want to, and the government takes care of protecting us from foreign interests and one another.” ~ Killer Mike About the Author

20243,20243,Photos: Islamic State Says It’s Again Deploying Drones in Mosul,Aaron Klein and Ali Waked,"Photos released by the Islamic State group purport to show that its jihadists are again using small unmanned drones to attack targets in the area of Mosul where IS is in the midst of a battle with the Iraqi army. [The use of drones was allegedly renewed after about a month during which the group avoided deploying them in combat. In the photos released by ISIS on the group’s Telegram account, its small unmanned aircraft can be seen attacking Shi’ite militia targets on the outskirts of Mosul (above and below).   Earlier this month, a U. S.  coalition airstrike reportedly struck an IS drone factory in Mosul. The U. S.  international military coalition killed Islamic State foreign drone experts and destroyed a drone factory in western Mosul on Monday. The redeployment of IS drones comes as the group finds itself being pushed back toward the Old City of Mosul, a zone without many open areas where the aircraft can operate. Meanwhile, reports circulated on Iraqi social media citing Shi’ite activists saying the U. S. has supplied the Iraqi army with equipment designed to neutralize and disrupt the use of IS drones. مصادر إعلامية | تزويد #فرقة_الرد_السريع في #الموصل باسلحة تشويش تم استيرادها من #الصين لمواجهة طائرات #داعش المسيرة pic. twitter.   —   غريب (@2011iqbgd2017) April 14, 2017,  In February, the Iraqi army claimed that it had raided a drone factory near Mosul. Also that month, the Stratfor global intelligence newsletter investigated the IS drone threat, writing, The Islamic State is taking to the skies as the fight for Mosul wears on. Over the past several weeks, the extremist group has been flaunting its use of unmanned aerial vehicles against Iraqi army and Kurdish forces in and around the city. Propaganda videos feature dramatic aerial footage of the precision attacks, and they have produced their intended effect, receiving heavy coverage in mainstream media outlets. So far, the Islamic State has deployed this technique only in Iraq and Syria. That’s likely soon to change, though, considering the attention the group’s drone attacks have been getting and the prevalence of drones in the West. Drone attacks are coming. But they do not necessarily portend death from above. Reuters last month reported on less sophisticated IS drones: For the past decade, unmanned aerial vehicles have been a cornerstone of America’s campaign against Islamic insurgents in the Greater Middle East. Predator and Reaper drones crisscross the globe firing Hellfire missiles on U. S. enemies. Other countries have operational drone fleets, but few match the might and ubiquity of America’s. But journalists on the front lines in Iraq have seen a disturbing new trend  —   Islamic State using retail quadcopters to drop their own munitions with surprising accuracy. Mosul is the frontline in the fight against ISIS as well as the frontline in a new arm’s race. One that pits the tiny drones of the Islamic State against the budding   technology of the West. To be clear, Islamic State’s commercial quadcopters rigged with grenades and manufactured missiles is nothing compared to the power of a Predator firing off Hellfire missiles with pinpoint accuracy. But that’s cold comfort to a civilian killed by a handmade explosive dropped by a quadcopter over the streets of Mosul.",0
20244,20244,Ireland’s Prime Minister in Crisis Over Case of Police Whistle-Blower - The New York Times,Sinead O’Shea,"DUBLIN  —   Enda Kenny, Ireland’s prime minister since 2011, is facing one of the worst political crises of his career over a convoluted police scandal that has dragged on for more than a decade. The scandal has been compared to the case of Frank Serpico, the detective whose testimony in the 1970s brought to light corruption in the New York Police Department. The matter dates to 2006, when an officer began raising concerns about   misconduct within the National Police Service. The officer, Sgt. Maurice McCabe, quickly found himself shunned by his fellow officers. But he persisted, exposing what he said was a practice of deleting penalty points incurred by drivers for minor traffic violations. Eventually, a government inquiry found in his favor. But the case won’t go away. Last week, The Irish Examiner and the public broadcaster RTE’s “Prime Time” program reported that Ireland’s child protection agency had created a file on Sergeant McCabe containing a false accusation of child sexual abuse  —   a mistake that the agency has attributed to what it called a clerical error. The news organizations also reported that this wasn’t the first time Sergeant McCabe had been wrongly accused of such a crime an earlier complaint against him had been made, in 2006, and dismissed. The disclosure that a   could face such accusations in apparent retaliation has raised unsettling questions about Ireland’s culture of policing and the possible collusion of other agencies, including the child protection agency. The case has affected the highest levels of the Irish government, bedeviling Mr. Kenny. He has been attacked by critics who charge that he missed opportunities to resolve the mess in 2014, and supported the police chief at the time and his justice minister for too long. Mr. Kenny failed at first to give a complete account of when he learned of the false abuse allegations, and has insisted that he knew nothing of a broader smear campaign  —   an assertion that his critics in Parliament have contested. There were heated exchanges between Mr. Kenny and Gerry Adams, the leader of the opposition Sinn Fein party. At one point, Mr. Kenny called Mr. Adams an “absolute hypocrite” and attacked him for playing down, years earlier, the case of a former Sinn Fein member who said she was sexually abused by IRA members  —   a charge that Mr. Adams denies. Mr. Kenny has pledged a new official inquiry into the latest developments in the McCabe case. Late Wednesday night he survived a   motion put forward by Sinn Fein. Both Mr. Kenny’s party, Fine Gael, and the Fianna Fail party, whose support Mr. Kenny needs, had little appetite for fresh elections that could unsettle their fragile alliance. But observers say the prime minister has been wounded by the scandal, and may not survive long after he returns from a trip to Washington to meet President Trump for St. Patrick’s Day. On Wednesday evening, ahead of the vote, Mr. Kenny apologized in Parliament to Sergeant McCabe. He called the allegations against him “appalling. ” “He and his family deserve the truth, as do all against whom allegations have been made,” Mr. Kenny said. “And I therefore offer a full apology to Maurice McCabe and his family for the treatment handed out to them as exposed in recent programs. ” Sergeant McCabe, and his wife, Lorraine, said in a statement that they had been victims of a “long and sustained campaign to destroy our characters. ” They added: “We have endured eight years of great suffering, private nightmare, public defamation, and state vilification arising solely,” they said, from Sergeant McCabe’s determination to ensure that the police agency “adheres to decent and appropriate standards of policing in its dealings with the Irish people. ” Sergeant McCabe, 55, a father of five from County Westmeath in the center of the country, has been on sick leave since last year. The McCabe case has exposed the secretive and insular nature of the police service. An internal investigation into Sergeant McCabe’s complaints found no evidence of corruption, but concluded that some officers had failed to follow procedures. But a police chief, Martin Callinan, stunned the country when he told lawmakers in 2014 that   like Sergeant McCabe were “disgusting. ” (He later took early retirement.) Dermot Walsh, a law professor at the University of Kent in England who has studied police and criminal justice in Ireland, said the uproar “was not so much what he was complaining about as the fact that he took his complaints outside the force  —   in other words, he was seen as not a team player, not a member of the club. ” Professor Walsh added that Sergeant McCabe “had stepped over to the other side of the line between ‘them’ and ‘us,’ ” and compared the case to that of Detective Serpico. He also said the hierarchical organization of the police agency made it resistant to criticism from its lower ranks. In 2014, the justice minister, Alan Shatter, resigned after a report commissioned by the government found that the government and the police had failed to address Sergeant McCabe’s allegations adequately. A second report, prepared by a commission led by a judge, Kevin O’Higgins, found that Sergeant McCabe had performed “a genuine public service at considerable personal cost. ” Now, the case is about to get yet another look. Mr. Kenny has promised to investigate whether a smear campaign targeted Sergeant McCabe. The task was originally assigned to a private commission of inquiry, led by a judge, but after the latest furor, Mr. Kenny agreed to appoint a tribunal, whose proceedings will be open to the public  —   something that Sergeant McCabe said he believed was essential. Another   Superintendent David Taylor, a former police press officer, has come forward to say that the existence of a smear campaign against Sergeant McCabe was widely known within the police force and by his superiors, including Commissioner Noirin O’Sullivan. She has asserted her innocence. “I have made it clear that I was not part of any campaign to spread rumors about Sergeant McCabe and didn’t know it was happening at the time it was happening,” Commissioner O’Sullivan said in a statement on Monday. Yet another police officer, Superintendent Keith Harrison, has come forward, saying that he stopped a colleague for drunken driving in 2009 and, in retaliation, found his family referred to the child protection agency over a baseless allegation.",0

Editor’s Comment: The evidence is now overwhelming – whatever the full truth of the matter, something is very, very suspicious about the “pizza code” that has been discovered in the leaked Podesta emails that many believe is connected to a ring of pedophilia activity. Independent researchers have been scouring the web for supporting information, and have pieced together a disturbing pile of circumstantial evidence connecting many of DC’s most powerful to lewd comments, references to illegal sex acts and child trafficking, dark art and more. It is very likely that this could go to the very top, where powerful people are protected by people with ranking positions inside the power structure. 
Perhaps that is why many channels and researchers are meeting censorship, threats and bans. Reddit’s thread on the topic, which was quickly becoming the definitive gathering place for the information, was shut down. Meanwhile, the entire The Daily Sheeple website was shutdown temporarily over a copyright claim about an image in “pizza gate” story (see video at bottom).

As Hillary Clinton makes her last few rounds of appearances before election day, the presidential hopeful will feel a little bit of the pressure that the presidency will demand. However, when she arrived at her rally in Lake Worth, Florida, she attempted to make one move that she hoped no one would notice. 
There have been many questions over the course of Hillary Clinton’s campaign regarding her health. As a result of her age and her lifestyle, there’s no doubt that her body is starting to feel the effects of aging – whether she likes to admit it or not. 
However, video footage of her recent rally in Florida shows how desperate she is to keep her health problems hidden, but her attempt was met with failure the moment she hit the stage. In fact, the Democratic presidential candidate struggled to climb one single step. The video captures one of her aides rushing towards her side as she attempted to climb up the riser. 
“She needed assistance to get onto it as she could be seen reaching her hand out for a boost or some added steadiness,” according to The American Mirror . “The aide extended his hand and Clinton held on tightly as she made her way up the 18 inches.” 
Although Hillary Clinton insists that her health isn’t an issue, the number of incidents she has had paints quite a different picture. If you take a close look at the video, the aide can even be seen standing behind her, reaching for her waist – probably preparing for the event of her falling. 
We have said it time and time again – she’s not fit to be president. Although her health is a major concern considering how demanding the presidency can be on a person, it’s her disastrous political history that raises, even more, concerns.",1
20247,20247,15 Foods That Contain The Mother Of All Antioxidants,REALdeal,"-Onions -Red peppers 
Notice they are all healthy foods we often don’t get enough of? This is another big issue with our diets. We consume a lot of junk, meat, dairy and processed foods, items that clinically have been proven to be the number one causes of heart disease and illness yet we consume them in huge quantities. The key is to limit these and eat a lot of fresh, lively foods that provide nutrients and don’t ask the body to perform a mega job to digest. 

You can also increase your exercise as glutathione production increases when you exercise. Breathing and sweating are also great ways to get rid of toxins in the body. 
Glutathione Protects Against Chronic Illness 
What makes glutathione so important and powerful is that it recycles antioxidants. When your body is dealing with free radicals, it is essentially passing them from one molecule to another. They might go from vitamin C to vitamin E to lipoic acid and then to glutathione where they are cooled off. Antioxidants are recycled at this point and the body can now regenerate another glutathione molecule to go back at it again. 

Glutathione is crucial for helping your immune system fight chronic illness as it acts as the carrier of toxins out of your body. Like a fly trap, toxins stick to glutathione and they are carried to the bile into the stools and out of the body. Glutathione is also powerful enough that it has been shown to help in the treatment of AIDS greatly. The body is going to get in touch with oxidants and toxins, the more we can deal with those the better our body will be at staying strong, this is why glutathione is so important. 

Dr. Mark Hyman has given 9 tips to increase your Glutathione levels. Check them out! 

1. Consume sulfur-rich foods. The main ones in the diet are garlic, onions and the cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, kale, collards, cabbage, cauliflower, watercress, etc.). 

2. Try bioactive whey protein. This is great source of cysteine and the amino acid building blocks for glutathione synthesis. As you know, I am not a big fan of dairy , but this is an exception — with a few warnings. The whey protein MUST be bioactive and made from non-denatured proteins (“denaturing” refers to the breakdown of the normal protein structure). Choose non-pasteurized and non-industrially produced milk that contains no pesticides, hormones, or antibiotics. Immunocal is a prescription bioactive non-denatured whey protein that is even listed in the Physician’s Desk Reference. 

3. Exercise boosts your glutathione levels and thereby helps boost your immune system, improve detoxification and enhance your body’s own antioxidant defenses. Start slow and build up to 30 minutes a day of vigorous aerobic exercise like walking or jogging, or play various sports. Strength training for 20 minutes 3 times a week is also helpful. 

One would think it would be easy just to take glutathione as a pill, but the body digests protein — so you wouldn’t get the benefits if you did it this way. However, the production and recycling of glutathione in the body requires many different nutrients and you CAN take these. Here are the main supplements that need to be taken consistently to boost glutathione. Besides taking a multivitamin and fish oil, supporting my glutathione levels with these supplements is the most important thing I do every day for my personal health. 

4. N-acetyl-cysteine. This has been used for years to help treat asthma and lung disease and to treat people with life-threatening liver failure from Tylenol overdose. In fact, I first learned about it in medical school while working in the emergency room. It is even given to prevent kidney damage from dyes used during x-ray studies. 

5. Alpha lipoic acid. This is a close second to glutathione in importance in our cells and is involved in energy production, blood sugar control, brain health and detoxification. The body usually makes it, but given all the stresses we are under, we often become depleted. 

6. Methylation nutrients (folate and vitamins B6 and B12). These are perhaps the most critical to keep the body producing glutathione. Methylation and the production and recycling of glutathione are the two most important biochemical functions in your body. Take folate (especially in the active form of 5 methyltetrahydrofolate), B6 (in active form of P5P) and B12 (in the active form of methylcobalamin). 

7. Selenium. This important mineral helps the body recycle and produce more glutathione. 

8. A family of antioxidants including vitamins C and E (in the form of mixed tocopherols), work together to recycle glutathione. 

9. Milk thistle (silymarin) has long been used in liver disease and helps boost glutathione levels.",1
20248,20248,Taking Refuge in Dollar Could Expose World Economy to New Perils - The New York Times,Peter S. Goodman,"It is known as the flight to safety, yet it may be leading the global economy toward fresh danger. In the week since Britain stunned the world with its vote to quit the European Union, coloring markets in uncertainty, investors have dumped much that seems risky  —   the pound, the euro and shares on stock exchanges around the world. They have entrusted the proceeds to that rare sure thing, United States Treasury bills. Too much money may now be sloshing toward the dollar. For the United States, a stronger currency makes exports more expensive on world markets, complicating an already halting economic expansion. For emerging markets, the move into the dollar could presage a tide of investment flowing out, imperiling economies from Brazil to Indonesia. For Europe, a weaker euro underscores fundamental doubts about whether leaders can finally muster a formula for economic vibrancy after years of disappointment and recrimination. When economies function in healthy fashion, money flows across investments in pursuit of rewards that are supposed to be correlated to risks. But when a shock hits and fear takes hold, investors tend to trust only storehouses with one key trait  —   the certainty of survival. Since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, or “Brexit,” the dollar has gained nearly 3 percent compared with a broad basket of currencies, about 2. 5 percent against the euro, and nearly 12 percent against the pound. The latest surge came on Thursday, when Mark J. Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said the central bank would probably have to lower interest rates to support the economy. That sent the pound hurtling downward anew. On Friday, the yield on   United States Treasury notes dipped to a record low, 1. 385 percent, reflecting the eagerness of investors to lock their money in a safe place even for minuscule returns. The charge into the dollar says less about investors’ faith in the United States and more about the alarming situations confronting other major economies. With the vote, Britain has jeopardized its dominant financial center and trade with Europe, the largest common market on earth. The country is now enmeshed in a leadership crisis that makes everything uncertain, including who will negotiate the terms of a messy divorce with the European Union. If leaders follow through and initiate that process, Britain must haggle with the remaining bloc, made of 27 different European governments operating with their own domestic politics. The 19 countries that share the euro appear vulnerable to political discord and widening separatism as they contend with an influx of refugees, aging populations and tepid economic growth. Years of confusion may be unfolding  —   the sort of turmoil that could make a money manager crave safety. The United States is not without risks. Its public debt exceeds $19 trillion. Fractious politics have in recent years brought the country to the verge of   default. It has economic inequality rivaling the Gilded Age of the late 19th century and tens of millions of working people who have essentially lost faith in the American economic bargain as living standards have declined. The Republican Party is on the verge of nominating Donald J. Trump as its presidential candidate. His intimations that he might oversee the Treasury much as he has managed   Atlantic City casinos  —   by renegotiating with creditors  —   sent shudders through global markets. And yet, the United States can print its own money while finding seemingly limitless demand for its debt. The dollar remains the foundation of global finance, the one piece of a cosmically complex puzzle in which continued faith is required or the totality ceases to make sense. So powerful is the market’s craving for dollars in times of crisis that it has intensified even when the United States has itself been the locus of trouble. From September 2008 to February 2009, as the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers turned a crisis into the worst financial panic since the Great Depression, the dollar surged by nearly 10 percent. “Rightly or wrongly, there are existential questions about the future of the euro,” said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. “Say what you will about the dollar, no one questions that it will be around 10 or 20 years from now. ” In recent years, as European leaders failed to spur growth and as Greece slipped toward the abyss, nearly abandoning the euro, a lack of effective political coordination has time and again bedeviled effective response. The   countries, like Greece, Spain and Portugal, have sought to unleash government spending, running deficits to stimulate their economies. Germany, the eurozone’s most powerful member, has vetoed that move, demanding that they instead cut spending, including on pensions and social services. Britain’s decision to leave the union has been widely construed as an angry admonition to the establishment from working people who have absorbed global trade, immigration and European political integration only to see their living standards stagnate. Britain has its own currency and authority over its budget. It has much lower unemployment and healthier economic growth than the eurozone does. If such ferment can explode in Britain, the eurozone looks like a tinderbox. “The people running Europe have gotten so disconnected from what the majority wants, and has always wanted for decades,” said Mark Weisbrot,   of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Will Britain’s withdrawal alter the politics and spur Germany to moderate its obsession with austerity? Will Berlin assent to less dogmatic economic policies aimed at bolstering growth and spreading the spoils? Those are questions lacking answers. At the same time, the British vote to leave has energized populist movements with separatist inclinations in Hungary, Italy and the Netherlands. Every new development heightening doubts about the cohesion of the European project risks provoking investors to demand greater compensation for loans to   borrowers like Italy, Portugal and Greece. The more those countries have to pay to keep credit flowing, the greater the worries about the health of their banking systems. The greater the reduction in banks’ willingness to lend, the tighter the chokehold on European economic growth. And the absence of growth is both cause and effect of the populist inclinations coursing through the region. And so the cycle potentially turns, with only one predictable outcome: a flight to safety. “Continuing uncertainty is going to make the dollar go up more,” said Kenneth Rogoff, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at Harvard. “If the uncertainty continues, it’s going to hit the periphery of Europe,” he added. “It’s probably going to hit emerging markets. ” World markets are now so interconnected that when money shifts with unexpected severity, it can yield unanticipated effects. Such was the case in 2013, as the Fed signaled its intention to slow the pace of its extraordinary interventions. The Fed had been buying vast quantities of bonds to keep interest rates low after the financial crisis. Ben S. Bernanke, then the chairman, let slip in May 2013 the Fed’s intention to “taper” such purchases. The result became known as the taper tantrum  —   a damaging stampede out of emerging markets. Currencies dropped in Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey. Stock markets fell. Businesses suffered, laying off workers. A repeat today would unfold at an especially difficult time. The slowdown of China’s economy has diminished the appetite for goods produced worldwide. Weaker growth in Europe puts more pressure on emerging markets. The Fed is supposed to serve American interests, yet as the taper tantrum brought home, its impacts are felt everywhere. Now, the Fed is weighing when to lift rates after years of maintaining them near zero. “There’s a potential for huge volatility and huge shocks,” said Mark Blyth, a political economist at Brown University. “The part of this that no one can say out loud is that the Fed is the global central bank. ”",0
20249,20249,Parents of Terror Victim Sue Chicago-Area Palestinian Groups to Collect Jury Award,Breitbart Jerusalem,"(AP) CHICAGO  —   The parents of a    yeshiva student fatally shot in the West Bank by Hamas terrorists in 1996 filed a federal lawsuit Friday against two     groups to collect on a legal judgment stemming from the death. [Stanley and Joyce Boim filed the lawsuit in Chicago against American Muslims for Palestine and Americans for Justice in Palestine Educational Foundation. The Chicago Tribune reports the couple alleges the   organizations are “alter egos” of three Islamic fundraising groups held liable several years ago for the death of their son, David, who was killed in a   shooting in Beit El.  The Boims initially filed a lawsuit in 2000, alleging the American Muslim Society, the Islamic Association for   and the Quranic Literacy Institute gave to Palestinian charities that ultimately helped fund terrorism. A federal jury entered a $52 million judgment against the charities in 2004, and the trial judge tripled the amount to $156 million. A federal appeals court upheld the judgment in 2008. The Boims’ attorney, Stephen Landes, said the family received only a fraction of the award because the defendants said they had no money to pay the judgment and shut down. He said the successor groups named in Friday’s lawsuit formed later with many of the same men in similar leadership roles. “What we ended up finding is they just tried to rebrand themselves, and they set up down the street,” Landes said. If the groups are allowed to move on without paying the judgment, Landes said, “it makes a mockery” of federal   laws. Messages left with American Muslims for Palestine by the Tribune were not returned. Friday’s lawsuit also names three individuals identified as leaders of the group, including Abdelbasset Hamayel, identified as its executive director and the   of the defunct Islamic Association for Palestine. Hamayel told the Tribune he was unaware of the lawsuit and declined to comment. He didn’t immediately return a message left   at his office by The Associated Press. It is unclear if Americans for Justice in Palestine Educational Foundation is still operating it doesn’t have a separate website or a publicly listed phone number.",0

PT, but Hollywood’s biggest stars have already begun arriving on the red carpet. Jimmy Kimmel hosts this year’s ceremony live from the Dolby Theater in Hollywood.  The storylines to watch:  —   How many wins can the musical La La Land rack up out of its record 14 total nominations? Director Damien Chazelle and leads Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are all hoping for big nights in their respective categories, though Gosling faces stiff competition from Denzel Washington (Fences) and Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea).  —   Which stars will use the Oscars stage to launch   Trump tirades? Meryl Streep  —   up for a record 20th Oscar nom for Florence Foster Jenkins  —   is set as a presenter, so there is a decent possibility of a Golden   encore, but it could really come from all angles tonight. Look out for Kimmel to zing Trump in his opening monologue.  —   Mel Gibson’s Hacksaw Ridge is up for six awards, but don’t expect him to win Best Director.

M.  —   Good god. This has got to be the most surreal ending to an Oscars broadcast ever. Moonlight has won Best Picture. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway read the wrong title off the card, announcing La La Land as Best Picture. Kimmel blames Steve Harvey. No one in the audience can quite believe it. This is an epic  . More coming shortly. New rule: After that astonishing #Oscars gaffe, no one in Hollywood can make fun of @realDonaldTrump for anything over the next eight years.  —   Joel B.

An emotional Stone gives a heartfelt   to the other actresses in the category and thanks her family and the filmmakers. 8:48 P. M.  —   Casey Affleck wins Best Actor for Manchester by the Sea. Wow. I thought Denzel had this one on lock. Looks like Affleck got his   out of the way last night, though, because this acceptance speech is short and sweet. “I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say. ” We don’t, so thanks for keeping it short. 8:43 P. M.  —   At 32, Damien Chazelle becomes the youngest director ever to win the Best Director prize, for La La Land. 8:34 P.

Kimmel is participating in the celebrity “inspiration” videos, talking about how his nemesis Matt Damon has inspired him. The movie that most inspired him is Damon’s We Bought a Zoo. The Oscars announcer introduces “Ben Affleck and Guest,” as Affleck and Damon take the stage. The music guy cuts off Damon every time he tries to speak. The camera pans back and it’s Kimmel directing the orchestra. Probably the funniest bit of the night. 8:26 P. M.  —   With 8:44 to go in the fourth, Charlotte has taken the lead.

Says there’s only one “Braveheart” in the room, and he’s not going to unite us. Cue an awkward pan to Mel Gibson. Wow. Kimmel urges the audience to reach out to one person you have a disagreement with, not as a liberal or conservative, and have a positive conversation with them. That would be a way to “make America great again,” he says. But the moment is   as Kimmel calls President Trump a racist just one minute later. He thanks the president: “Remember last year when we thought the Oscars were racist?” The host also roasts the stars by saying (rightly) that no one came out to see their films.

20251,20251,BOMBSHELL AUDIO: Hillary Clinton Herself Recorded Calling for Rigging Election,K. Campbell,"Huckabee Responds To Flag-Burning Trump Hater…“What’s Happened To This Country?” 
“I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,” Clinton told editor Eli Chomsky. 
“And if we were going to push for an election,” she added, “then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.” 
The election resulted in a resounding victory for Hamas over the U.S.-preferred Fatah — something Clinton, apparently, thought could have been avoided if we had somehow influenced the outcome (aka: “rigged” the election). Advertisement - story continues below 
Listen to the audio here: 
Chomsky said he recalled being taken aback that “anyone could support the idea — offered by a national political leader, no less — that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections,” according to the Observer . 
But for conservatives who have been warning against Clinton for years, it comes as little surprise that she would want to use her political power to influence the outcome of an election inappropriately. Advertisement - story continues below",1
20252,20252,A Reunion 21 Years in the Making - The New York Times,John Otis,"He survived conscription in Eritrea, conspired to confront his country’s injustices and faked an emergency to elude the authorities when they discovered his plan. He fled across the African country’s border to Ethiopia and made his way to a refugee camp, braving horrific conditions and rationed food and water for a chance to eventually get to the United States. Yet it was in a terminal at Kennedy International Airport in March that Melake Gebreselase was overcome with anxiety. Now living in New York, he arrived there three hours before his wife of 21 years, Sebentu Aynu Kidane, was supposed to exit customs. Then her plane landed but she was nowhere to be found. “You can worry: ‘What happened? Did she not come? ’” Mr. Gebreselase, 38, said. After a delay passing through immigration, however, Ms. Kidane, 41, emerged and they embraced, both free and together at last after years of forced separation, including a   period during which they did not speak to each other. Mr. Gebreselase, who is still learning English, said in a recent interview that he could not articulate in his new language the emotions he felt that March day. Ms. Kidane, however, remembered what was on her mind. “When I came here, I told him that I liked very, very much to have baby,” she said. “Now that I’m pregnant, I’m happy. ” In April, the couple will welcome their first child. Various forces prevented them from starting a family for nearly two decades. The couple married in 1995 in Eritrea, where military conscription is mandatory and indefinite. Mr. Gebreselase was pulled into military service a couple of years after he married Ms. Kidane. He hoped he would have to serve for only a year and a half. After eight years, he felt certain he would be stuck there until retirement. The only time he saw his wife, friends and other relatives was during periods of leave that lasted roughly 10 days. “It was not enough to meet with her to have a baby,” Mr. Gebreselase said. On a visit home in 2005, Mr. Gebreselase, indignant about his conscription and about injustices in his country, held a meeting with villagers about a plan to criticize the government. His actions attracted the attention of the authorities, and he was arrested. Fearing the horrors that awaited him in jail, Mr. Gebreselase feigned a bathroom emergency  —   and made a run for it, reaching the refugee camp in Ethiopia. According to Amnesty International, the mass of young Eritrean people fleeing the country’s national service has contributed to the global refugee crisis. Mr. Gebreselase, separated from his wife, would not speak to her again until 2013 Ms. Kidane said that all she knew about her husband’s fate was that he was alive. In the camp, eight people were assigned to share one small hut. Refugees were given paltry food rations and had to wait hours in line to get water, Mr. Gebreselase said. In 2013, Mr. Gebreselase received legal refugee status and arrived in New York, where he called his wife. He urged Ms. Kidane to go to Ethiopia and then to try to join him in the United States. Mr. Gebreselase moved into an apartment in the Bronx with three roommates and found work at a restaurant. He also enrolled in classes to learn English. “From Monday up through Friday, I was working,” Mr. Gebreselase said. “Saturday, I was at school. ” Mr. Gebreselase sent money to Ms. Kidane, who by then had reached Ethiopia, where she stayed first in a refugee camp and later in an apartment in Addis Ababa, the capital. Mr. Gebreselase said that the more time passed, the more nervous he became about being able to have a child with his wife before she grew too old. Eventually, Ms. Kidane was granted refugee status, and she arrived at Kennedy on March 13. The couple rented a single room for $600 a month in an apartment in the Bronx. They will have to find a new place to live, because the friend they are renting from will soon be having family members move in with him. For now, Mr. Gebreselase works six days a week at a restaurant, where he earns $9. 25 an hour. Ms. Kidane works part time at a hardware store, earning $10 an hour. The couple also receives $39 a month in food stamps. Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund, used $500 from the fund to enable the couple to buy a crib, a stroller and baby clothes. They hope their child will be the first of at least two. Ms. Kidane expects to enroll in nursing school soon. Mr. Gebreselase is considering becoming a cabdriver. He is committed to remaining in New York. “If you don’t work hard, you will not have,” Mr. Gebreselase said. “We’re going to work hard. We need a good life. ”",0
20253,20253,Avoiding the Dreaded Middle Seat May Now Cost You - The New York Times,Martha C. White,"As flying goes, the only thing more uncomfortable than sitting next to a couple having a spat on an airplane, Maury Rogoff learned, is sitting between that couple  —   especially when one partner prefers bare feet. Ms. Rogoff, who owns a public relations firm with offices in New York and Florida and travels frequently, discovered what a growing number of travelers now know: The middle seat has become the third rail of flying  —   and it is getting harder to avoid. As planes fly at record capacity and new cabin configurations squeeze in ever more passengers, airlines are, intentionally or not, nudging fliers into paying extra to avoid drawing the proverbial short straw. “I was literally in the middle of their argument,” Ms. Rogoff said. “It was just that awful. ” Her discomfort was magnified when the husband kicked off his shoes and crossed his legs, thrusting a bare foot into Ms. Rogoff’s space. Her entreaties with his wife to swap seats fell on deaf ears. “Of course she had no interest because it was middle, and because it was a smelly foot,” Ms. Rogoff said. For travelers like Ms. Rogoff, airlines are making it harder than ever to avoid the middle seat based on luck alone. Southwest, which does not assign seats, raised the price of an   pass to $15 from $12. 50 last month. For those who do not pay up, it is a mad rush when online   opens 24 hours before the flight. Delta Air Lines’ Basic Economy fare, introduced last year, does not allow seat assignments to be made until after    —   when   customers have had a chance to claim window and aisle seats. American Airlines and United Airlines plan to introduce similar fares this year. Neither would confirm whether selecting a seat would be one of the perks eliminated, but one airline analyst said it was likely, given the competition legacy airlines face from   carriers. “It’s a way to compete,” said Max Rayner, a partner at Hudson Crossing, a consulting firm in New York. “If you want to go at premium times, there will be far fewer seats available at the lower end of prices. ” Mr. Rayner suggested that this shift in pricing models wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, saying it could be a boon for the most   customers. “You can think of it actually as opening up choice,” he said. “You just want basic transportation  —   sure, here it is. ” But the crunch has left some travelers taking extreme measures to avoid getting stuck in the middle. Fliers said they have offered fellow travelers money or drinks to switch seats, paid the fee to upgrade to a premium or exit row, feigned illness or switched flights. Some travelers even report buying two seats, just to have an empty one next to them. Dr. Sachin Shridharani, a plastic surgeon in New York, found himself on an overbooked flight back from San Diego, and a middle seat was the only one available. “I told them I’d be willing to take another flight,” he said. “I’ll pretty much do just about anything to avoid sitting in that notorious, infamous middle seat. ” The   was to wait in the airport for four hours, but Dr. Shridharani said it was worth it so he could work on the way home. “You can’t have someone looking over your shoulder,” he said. In the end, analysts say, airlines are selling a form of real estate, but they are trading in square inches, not square feet. “People buy work space that’s really what they buy on board,” said Robert W. Mann Jr. an airline industry consultant. “Some of those configurations may not give you enough room, for example, to take out a laptop and use it productively. ” One carrier, though, has tried to address the issue. Frontier Airlines recently installed new seats on its Airbus A319 and A320 planes, with the middle seats about an inch wider than the window and aisle seats. But for most passengers, the tight squeeze continues, and business travelers say counting on their   status to avoid the middle seat is no longer a sure thing. “You can’t show up at the airport hoping to talk your way into an upgrade,” said Mark Jeffries, a corporate speaker and author. “You don’t see free seats anymore. ” Mr. Jeffries said he sometimes buys two seats  —   a window or aisle, and a middle. It’s cheaper than buying a   or   ticket on a legacy carrier, he said. “We find that people will pay for premium economy or any kind of seat assignment if they’re traveling solo to avoid the middle seat,” said Julia Douglas, owner and president of Jet Set World Travel in Chicago. Some travelers will spend hundreds of dollars more, she added. Another approach is to appeal to another traveler. “There have been instances where I’ve bought someone an upgrade,” said Michael Winston, who used to travel once or twice a week while working in management consulting. At times, he said, he had resorted to bargaining with seatmates to avoid the middle seat. It is not an uncommon transaction, frequent travelers say, with cash, upgrades and cocktails all serving as forms of currency. But that is assuming that the seats are available. Last year, airline capacity again hit a record high, just shy of 85 percent, meaning that a lot of flights are full. And that leaves flight attendants and travel agents acting as de facto referees for games of midair musical chairs. The excuses passengers use to avoid the middle seat are many, they say. “Long legs is always one,” Ms. Douglas said. She then listed the most common complaints: claustrophobia, a need for frequent trips to the bathroom,   panic attacks and a penchant for airsickness. “I don’t know if any of them are truly medically founded,” she said. “I just think it’s anxiety about being in that middle seat. ” Of all the excuses, genuine or exaggerated, the one that seems most effective is the threat of gastrointestinal distress. William Bauer, who travels frequently as an executive at a manufacturer of leather goods, said that hinting at a medical need for quick access to the bathroom usually prompted either gate agents or fellow passengers to make the switch for him. “Make it clear that you need that aisle seat. Really convey a compelling sense of urgency,” he said. “Thus far, I’ve never been rejected. ” On one recent flight, though, the tables were turned when Mr. Bauer found himself on the receiving end of a plea to swap seats on a     flight. “There was a woman I gave up my aisle seat for because she cried,” he said. “If you cry, you win. ”",0
20254,20254,Ernie Els: ‘We Would Not be Playing For the Money We Play For If It Wasn’t For Tiger’ - Breitbart,Robert J. Marlow,"South African golfer and   major champion Ernie Els looks forward to the return of Tiger Woods at the Farmers Insurance Open next week at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, California. [The smooth swinging    Els, AKA The Big Easy, thinks it quite plausible that Tiger can work his way back to winning tournaments again, including major championships. Els, who won the last of his four major at the British Open at Royal Lytham  St. Annes Golf Club in 2012 at age 42, points out, “If players like myself, Darren Clarke and Mark O’Meara won (majors) in our 40s, surely Tiger thinks he can do it too. I am sure it’s on his agenda. ”  Els says he would love to see Tiger play like his old self and thinks that he can do it if he can get it going at some of his favorite tournaments.  “Mentally, he is as strong as anybody but he needs to find some momentum at his favorite events and if he gets that, he can start believing again. I would love to see him play like he did back in the 90s, but I am not sure that is going to happen,” Els told reporters on Wednesday. Certainly, there are a number of events he likes and no one exemplifies the idea of “horses for courses” more than Tiger. Woods has dominated more golf courses than any golfer in the history of the sport. He’s won at least four times on the same course at seven different Tour stops: Cog Hill (former home of the BMW Championship) Firestone (WGC Bridgestone) Doral (WGC Cadillac) Muirfield Village (the Memorial) Bay Hill (Arnold Palmer Invitational) Augusta National (the Masters) and Torrey Pines (Farmers Insurance Open). The South African knows where his bread is buttered and who has held the spreader for the last couple of decades. “We would not be playing for the money we play for if it wasn’t for Tiger, so we have to thank him for that, for what he has done for the game and it can only be good if he plays well. ” Els praised Tiger for his achievements, observing that “It’s been 20 years since he won his first major at the Masters and it’s quite amazing what he has achieved. ” He added, Woods “has won 14 majors in that span and he was injured for at least three or four of those seasons, so it’s really a major for every year he has been healthy as a professional. That’s incredible. ”",0
20255,20255,Comment on What’s that strange lump embedded in Hillary Clinton’s face? by mildred.kraus,mildred.kraus,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by Dr. Eowyn 
Hillary Clinton is like a chameleon . 
Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams , who’s a trained hypnotist and observer of facial nuances, calls it an “unusual level of variability” in her physical appearance. In his words, Hillary “looks like an entirely different person every few days. See “ Chameleon Hillary Clinton is back to looking like sh*t — and the return of her medical handler ” and “ Hillary Clinton’s teeth, tongue-hole & now-you-see-it-now-you-don’t wrinkles ” 
On Monday, October 24, 2016, Hillary Clinton was in St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire for a rally , accompanied by “Fauxcahontas” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). 
Close-up images of her face show that she’s morphed again, back to yellow teeth and a face crisscrossed with wrinkles. What happened to the porcelain-doll Hillary with dazzling-white teeth of the July 2016 Democratic National Convention? 
But this time, at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, there’s something even stranger. 
Tuesday, Matt Drudge tweeted two close-up images of Hillary at the NH rally, which show something embedded under the skin of her right cheek . Here’s the tweet: 
Here are the two images again, enlarged. I painted yellow arrows pointing to the lumps: 
According to plastic surgeons , Botox injections don’t cause lumps under the skin. Dr. Richard Baxter explains that “Botox relaxes muscles that are hyperactive and so wrinkles caused by those muscles are smoothed,” but don’t lead to lumps. Dr. Janet Turkle says that although “Botox injections can result in temporary bumps due to the injection,” the bumps last “only a few minutes”. 
According to the American Academy of Facial Esthetics , however, “some of the risks of facial injections are lumps (granulomas/nodules) which are a potential risks [sic] associated with Radiesse, Sculptra, Juvederm, and ArteColl.” 
Facial injections are injections of facial fillers such as collagen, hyaluronic acid and calcium hydroxyl apatite that rejuvenate facial skin by reducing or eliminating wrinkles, raising scar depressions, enhancing lips and replacing soft-tissue volume loss.

20257,20257,Football Follies 2016: NCAA Week 9,J.E. Dyer,"Print 
Of all the weeks to turn in a late Follies post from your LU Football Commentary Service. 
We’ve already had two outcomes for our Inner Circle (more below, in case you’re still in suspense). 
But we’re also in a position to ask the eternal question: if Cal and USC play and no one pays attention, did anything happen? (FWIW, USC won, 45-24. Another Storied Rivalry settled for 2016. Cal ballcaps back in the closet, folks.) 
Next week: CFB rankings to lampoon. 
Tennessee whupped up on Jacksonville Thursday night in the pros. As nature seems to have intended this year. Get a defense, Jags. 
Inner circle 
The University of Tulsa Golden Hurricane (4-2), which beat Notre Dame 28-27 on 30 October 2010, will be at Memphis Saturday for an American West showdown. The Tigers are giving 6.5, but we think TU has a better shot than that. Should be a good game. 
Oklahoma, holding steady at #16, hosts Kansas (motto: “What difference, at this point, does it make?”) on Saturday evening, while laying a ridiculous 40.5. Has the betting fraternity been held in isolation for the last six weeks? Kansas isn’t nearly as bad as they were a year ago, and Oklahoma’s defense couldn’t stop a gum-wrapper chain if it were barreling down the field. Anything could happen, but this is just the sort of situation where Oklahoma ends up struggling in the final 2 minutes to stay on top of a 3-point lead. We’ll believe 40 when we see it. 
Oklahoma State gets to host #10 West Virginia, pride of the Big 12, in Stillwater early Saturday. As befits a ranked visitor facing a Gundy squad, the Mountaineers are giving, but not a lot – 3.5. That said, WVU could well find a way to rattle Cowboy QB Mason Rudolph. Game by game, the Mountaineers have tended to be a one-trick pony on defense this year, but they keep finding the right trick to get the job done. 
New #22 Navy will be squaring off with South Florida at Ray-Jay in Tampa by the time this goes to post. The 6-2 Bulls top the American East at the moment, while 5-1 Navy leads the American West, so there will be a lot of talk about a conference-champ preview. The Bulls scored 35 on Florida State in a wild early-season loss, but just took a bad dive last game against Temple. They’re favored by 6, but Navy’s likely to cover. (Umm. Well, any minute now, Navy’s going to start getting in the same hemisphere as “covering.” Good grief, Navy’s secondary just can’t keep up with these guys.) 
Army will be in Winston-Salem to take on Wake Forest Saturday, on the short end of 7. Wake could more than cover, but Army took a drubbing from North Texas last week, and will be out for blood. Key week to see if this year’s Black Knights are for real. 
Air Force , also coming off a painful loss to Hawaii, heads to Fresno State Friday evening for the late game. Falcons give 14.5. We think the Bulldogs will cover. 
Virginia Tech , back at #25 (for now), knocked off Pitt 39-36 in a rock-‘em-sock-‘em slugfest last night in Pittsburgh. Hard-fought battle with major yardage on both sides, but some intermittently impressive defense poking through as well. See what you can do, Hokies, when you don’t eat yourselves alive with penalties and turnovers? 
Nevada , we’re happy to say, has the week off. New #19 LSU is off this week as well, preparing for the rivalry bout with Alabama next week. 
For all you offense fans out there, TCU hosts Texas Tech on Saturday. We, personally, are going to be extremely disappointed if the combined total points clock in anywhere south of 130. Toads give 9.5. 
Kansas State is off to Iowa State to see what the Wildcats can do with the 1-6 Cyclones’ bad habit of losing. K-State is 4-3 and a solid shot for a bowl bid – but, still facing OK-State, Baylor, rival KU, and TCU down the stretch, they really want to add to the “W” column this weekend. 
Toledo is our other Thursday night winner, because we just know they had a Great Learning Experience coming in second to Ohio last night (31-26, for those with a thirst for data). Apparently it’s been quite a while since the Bobcats won in Toledo. Seemed to be all anybody could talk about. Rockets go to 6-2; their biggest conference game at division-leader (and #20) Western Michigan will be Thanksgiving week, and when they win that one, they may just get another crack at Ohio for the MAC crown. 
Wyoming hosts #13 Boise State, and it’s a measure of the Cowboys’ improved performance this year that the Broncos are only laying 13.5. It wouldn’t surprise us, exactly, for the Pokes to cover. 
Top 10 
#1 Alabama is off, preparing as any sensible team would to meet LSU. 
New #2 Michigan heads to East Lansing for something they’ve been wanting to do since 2012: win the Paul Bunyan Trophy back from Michigan State. This is the year they can do it. The Wolverines give 24 at the moment. The 2-5 Spartans will play them tough, of course, but we’re figuring on Blue from out here in the cheap seats. And who cares if the trophy looks like a manly man’s Hummel figurine? There’s nothing foofy about, you know, collecting. 
In default of better options, Clemson is cycling back through #3, and takes on #12 FSU in Tallahassee, in the marquee slot on Saturday evening. Tigers give only 4, even though the ‘Noles haven’t been all that, recently. The one and only Paul Bunyan Trophy, in play once more. (Image: Wikipedia) 
New #4 Washington is at #17 Utah, giving 11. 
New #5 Louisville heads to Charlottesville with a gift of 33 for hapless Virginia. 
New #6 Ohio State, which owes us all an apology for upsetting the top 10 in this incontinent way, hosts Northwestern, giving 27.5. 
New #7 Nebraska will be at #11 Wisconsin, facing the real probability of losing top 10 standing in their Storied Rivalry game, not to mention the Freedom Trophy. Which may be Just A Trophy, but is discreetly attractive at least. Badgers give 9.5. Why they fight. (Image: UW Athletic Communications via Fox Sports) 
New #8 Baylor is at Texas, giving 3.5, and better watch its six. 
#9 Texas A&M hosts New Mexico State, which makes for a meeting of Aggies but doesn’t seem to have a lot of other merits. A&M is laying 43.5. 
Best of the rest 
We can’t vouch in advance for the football, but it’s always an exciting weekend when Florida (#14) and Georgia meet in their Storied Rivalry to fight for the Okefenokee Oar. 
#15 Auburn at Ole Miss might be kind of interesting. Miami at Notre Dame holds possibilities, featuring a tight 1.5-point spread (Arsh) and the usual primo slot on the Notre Dame Broadcasting Channel. The Okefenokee Oar’s glamour shot from its Facebook page. 
Other ranks 
In FCS, McNeese State hosts Abilene Christian for the Cowboy Homecoming on Saturday evening. Abilene Christian is 1-7 and sucks royally, but they are coming off their one win (over Incarnate Word), and McNeese has whiffed on some softballs this season. But Go Pokes! 70s and clear for the 6 PM game start. 
In Div II, Slippery Rock (5-3) heads to Clarion to take on PSAC rival Clarion U. on Saturday. The Eagles are 2-6 and have already had their obligatory losses to ranked powerhouses California U. (PA) and IUP. We don’t want to say it’s cake for Clarion from here on, but we do suspect SRU may be a tad more motivated. Little Clarion P-A (pop. 5,000) is northeast of Pittsburgh (and Slippery Rock), and just southwest of the Allegheny National Forest, where it will be in the 60s and clouding up something fierce for the noon kickoff. 
In Div III, Rose-Hulman , AKA The Bomb, is now 6-2 and perched atop the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference after the epic win over Franklin. The Fightin’ Engineers host Bluffton U. (OH) in Terre Haute on Saturday, in a game that could be a showstopper. The Beavers come in 6-1 (4-1 conference), and although they lost to Franklin, they beat RHIT’s archrival Mt. St. Joe in September. Fight hard, Engineers. 70s and overcast for the 1:30 PM kickoff. 
Christopher Newport , now 5-2 after the owwie at Frostburg State, could do itself some major good hosting Salisbury U. (MD) for Homecoming Saturday night. Salisbury (6-1) is second in the NJAC, behind Frostburg, but also ranked #17 in the Coaches’ Poll. See how easy? Vault Salisbury and Wesley (which CNU beat a few weeks ago) in the NJAC, and maybe surge back into the top 25. Well, it’s a goal. Topping out at 70, with clear skies, for the 4 PM game start. 
Merchant Marine has the week off. 
Pros 
Our Redskins lead us off Sunday morning, playing Cincinnati at the ungodly hour of 6:30 AM PDT because they’ll be at Wembley Stadium in London. Bengals give 3. 
New Orleans hosts Seattle (-2.5) in the (godlier) early slot. 
San Diego and Denver are going to get right back on that horse in Sports Authority at Mile High, and we’d like to see the Broncos do something with their 4-point give this time. They did wallop the Texans, for what that’s worth. 
Dallas has a big one coming up Sunday night, hosting Philly in Arlington. The 5-point Cowboy advantage isn’t completely unjustifiable. 
Steelers have the week off. 
Monday night gives us Minnesota (-4.5) at Chicago.",1

20260,20260,"If they don’t want to break up families, why do the encourage “unaccompanied minors?”",Dr. Patrick Slattery,"175 Views Share: Commentary — Seriously, you always hear that we mustn’t deport people because it could break up families. Yet we are encouraging teenagers to run away from their families and try their luck on America’s streets! Latino Invasion Set for New Record 
The New Observer March 2, 2016 
More than 17,000 “unaccompanied alien minors” had invaded the US over the Mexican border in the past few months, and the number of “family units” has increased to 21,000, the US House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security has been informed. 
The House was also told that if the present trends continue, there will be a 30 percent increase on the record number of 260,000 invaders who entered the US in 2014. 


“In the past few months the number of unaccompanied alien minors unlawfully entering the US soared to over 17,000 and the number of family units increased to 21,000,” Chair Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) informed the US House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security in a February 4 hearing on Capitol Hill. 
“If these trends continue it is predicted there will be a 30 percent increase in the record high numbers we witnessed in 2014.” 
The widespread criminal violence endemic in the nonwhite Third World countries to the south continues to be a major factor in the ongoing invasion, Omar Zamora, public affairs officer for the US Border Patrol Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector told the local KVUE TV station. 
“We’ve got gangs over there that are controlling the neighborhoods, controlling the cities,” Zamora said. 
Agents of the RRGV Sector, he said, “man the front lines of the battle against drug trafficking and human smuggling.” 
The US government has mounted an ad campaign along the Guatemala–Honduras border warning would-be invaders what to expect from human traffickers. 
According to Zamora, the human traffickers engage in everything from child molestation and rape to extortion and fraud. READ Cologne Police Officer Confirms: It was “Refugees” 
“I think the biggest misconceptions are, ‘Hey they’re just children down there, right? It’s a humanitarian crisis,’” said Zamora, “But what I want to stress is there’s the 50 percent of the other individuals that are running, that are fighting, that have criminal records.” 
Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), who chairs the House Border Security Caucus, told KVUE that “If people figure they have a 95 percent chance of being allowed to stay and work and get government benefits, they’re going to come no matter what they might hear on the street or on the radio or see in a leaflet.” 
In a February 23 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) asked agency Acting Chief Ronald Vitiello whether giving undocumented immigrants the impression they won’t be allowed to stay in the US without a legal claim would act as a deterrent and slow the flow of unauthorized crossings. 
“Yes, I believe that matters,” Vitiello answered.",1
20261,20261,Indian Software Mogul: Hire Americans Now Because Trump Opposes H-1B Outsourcing Visas - Breitbart,Neil Munro,"A leading Indian software entrepreneur says Indian companies must accept President Donald Trump’s   policies and must start hiring Americans instead of sending Indian     visa workers into American job sites. [The startling Feb. 2 recommendation came from N. R. Narayana Murthy, the president and   of the     outsourcing firm, Infosys Limited, which has asked for more than 100, 000 work visas since 2013. The company uses the visas to send their   Indian employees to work in U. S. banks, manufacturers and service companies throughout the United States.  “We should stop using   visas and [stop] sending a large number of Indians to those countries to deliver services,” he said in an interview on an Indian affiliate of Microsoft’s MSN network. We have to recruit from colleges there, we have to train those local people [to work with] Indian companies   …     it is great opportunity for Indian companies to become more and more multicultural. Murthy’s televised concession appears as Indian and American companies rally to stop Trump from implementing his campaign promise to reform the   outsourcing visa program. Roughly 650, 000 foreign   workers are employed in a wide variety of   jobs in the United States, including roughly 100, 000 as academics, teachers, doctors, therapists, scientists, and designers at American universities. Overall, roughly 1 million foreign   are employed as contract workers in the United States, even as 800, 000 Americans graduate from college each year with skilled degrees to compete for   jobs. Throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump criticized the   program, which is used by many American companies, including Comcast, Carnival, Disney, McDonalds, Caterpillar and Uber. The Indian firms usually rent their   employees out to   American companies. The increased supply of foreign graduates pushes many   American professionals out of their careers, and pushes younger American graduates into different careers with lower salaries. The sidelined American professionals and their families have been a huge source of support for Trump among   voters because of Trump’s promise to reform the program. Trump’s plan to reform the   programs is expected to appear in the next few months, amid determined efforts by major U. S. companies  —   such as Microsoft and Google  —   to keep their reserve army of foreign professionals. On Friday, Trump met with top business advisors, many of whom oppose his January decision to exclude   immigrants with “hostile attitudes. ” In his TV interview, Murthy said Indian companies must hire Americans to become   global firms: I personally believe that Indian software companies must truly become multicultural. They must recruit American citizen [and] American residents in the U. S. they must recruit Canadians in Canada, British people in Britain, etc. That’s the only way we can become a true   company and in order to do that, we should stop using   visas and sending a large number of Indians to those countries to deliver services. We have to recruit from college there, we have to train those local people [to work with] Indian companies. Therefore, I think, even if the [Trump] Executive Order comes, we should look at it more as an opportunity for Indian companies to become more multicultural   …     it is great opportunity for Indian companies to become more and more multicultural.   Indian managers need to learn skills from American graduates, he said:  I think by and large, the Indian mindset is always to take the soft option.   …     Our managers will have to learn with   professionals   …     how to make sure that we understand the rules of crossing cultures. So therefore I think this is a learning opportunity for our senior people. This is not an easy option, it is s very tough option, but the earlier we start, the better it is for us. Companies also have to hire Americans because of legal risks, including Trump’s planned reform of the   outsourcing program: This is the only way you can remove a very important risk, which is the risk of governments mandating things like the Executive Order that we are talking about. I would think risk mitigation is a very important duty of any [company] board, and I have no doubt that all the boards of Indian software companies will at least now start thinking of this as a very important risk and will take action to mitigate. The TV interviewer responded by saying, “I certainly hope that Indian companies are listening to that because you are the best person to advise them on the road ahead.“ But many Indians criticized Murthy’s advice as bad for their nation’s industry and as hypocritical, because he made his fortune and name by renting India’s cheap programmers to American companies.  Major clients of Infosys:~ Bank of America~ Wells Fargo~ JP Morgan Chase~ Morgan Stanley#OutsourcedHypocrisyhttps:  .   —   Dr. Sania 🇳 (@DrSaniaMaan) February 3, 2017,  Murthy’s company is already facing legal threats in the United States because of its hiring practices. According to an November article in ComputerWorld, a judge has approved a lawsuit to proceed against Infosys for discriminating against Americans: The plaintiffs, four IT workers from around the U. S. brought their discrimination lawsuit against the   IT services giant in 2013. This week, they filed a motion seeking   certification from 2009, and say the potential pool of plaintiffs may be as large as 125, 000   …     There were some 50 exhibits filed in this case, including one from a former Infosys recruiter who said, in a declaration, that in conference calls “many of the highly qualified American candidates we presented were being rejected in favor of Indian candidates. ” The company’s reliance on Indian   workers may also have helped torpedo President Barack Obama’s disastrous Obamacare rollout: One plaintiff was hired by Infosys to work on a $49. 5 million Affordable Care Act,   development project for the District of Columbia. There were about 100 Infosys employees working on the healthcare project, but only three were American, the lawsuit claimed. The plaintiff alleged harassment, and was denied promotion, the complaint said. U. S. officials say the   program suffers from fraud and extensive corruption, especially in India where inflated resumes and faked documentation are used to get poorly trained and poorly paid Indian workers into American job sites. One U. S. government cable released via Wikileaks said that:   fraud is one of the top two visa categories for fraud throughout Mission India. All posts regularly encounter inflated or fabricated educational and employment qualifications. The vast majority of these documents come from Hyderabad. In the 18 months prior to the   of consular operations in Hyderabad, FPU Chennai investigated 150 companies in Hyderabad, 77 percent of which turned out to be fraudulent or highly suspect (ref F). Most of those cases slated for site visits were to verify the experience letters for   applicants who did not meet minimum educational qualifications. Murthy’s recommendation to hire more Americans was cautiously welcomed by one American software expert, who was forced out of regular work in the early 2000s when companies began hiring from the pool of 500, 000 younger and cheaper   contract workers now working in the sector. A recruiter for Infosys recently called him to talk about possible work, he said, but he remains skeptical: There are a lot of conversations going on, but until I confirm a start date and confirm compensation terms with the hiring company, it’s all nice  .   …     Most of the job leads I   on  —   I’m talking to someone clearly not born in the USA. This seems to me to be a   structural discrimination based on national origin when American [ ] most of the time, find themselves talking to   recruiters or   hiring managers. It’s like our tech labor market has been colonized. Another American technology expert, who is a legal immigrant, told Breitbart News that the inflow of foreign workers has crushed career prospects for   Americans, who are discriminated against because they are Americans and  . I have been turned down by every single possible employer. Every job in Atlanta that is advertised by the [Atlanta Journal Constitution] says that you can ‘apply, even if you have a university degree from another country,’ meaning from India. Microsoft’s CEO is from India. Google has hundreds of Indian and foreigners that have taken our jobs from us, Comcast is doing the same, and so is Facebook, etc.   …     I am in perfect health, I have no defects, I have no criminal records, my credit score is perfect, I taught at very prestigious universities (taught math and computer science, applications, C++ English language and Spanish language.   …     A few years ago I was making $50 an hour with a major corporation in Atlanta   …      A few weeks ago I was willing to accept $21 an hour from [a   company] working at their headquarters.  I had four phone interviews. They were ready to offer me the job. Until they saw me in person. They discriminated as they thought I was ‘too old’ for them. They said to the recruiter, that ‘I was going to get bored with the Job.’ I feel I was     …     I have two small children to feed and clothe. How could I allow myself to get bored?   visa workers are used throughout the American economy, and there is no annual cap on the number of   visas,   or or OPT visa graduates which can be brought into the United States. Companies are not required to interview or hire Americans before they hire foreign     and are not required to pay them market wages, and in some case, are not required to pay some taxes. Also, each year, companies are allowed to provide a huge bonus to as many as 150, 000 foreign contract workers who have worked long hours  —   the very valuable prize of U. S. citizenship for the workers and their family. The numbers and jobs of   workers are tracked at this website.

20262,20262,Police: Engaged Boston Doctors Murdered in Penthouse - Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,"Two Boston doctors were allegedly murdered in their penthouse Friday night, police said on Sunday. The victims were reportedly engaged to be married. [Boston Police Department responded to a call about “a suspect with a gun at a luxury condominium in South Boston” where Dr. Richard Field and Dr. Lina Bolanos lived. Police said the suspect “immediately began firing at the officers,” NBC News reported.  The suspect is    Bampumim Teixeira, who reportedly missed shooting the police officers however, police fired back at him multiple times, wounding the suspect in the process. Officers took him into custody and took him to Tufts Medical Center where he is undergoing treatment for injuries that are not considered   the Daily Mail reported. Officers found the bodies of Field, 49, and Bolanos, 38, with both of their throats slit and their hands bound when they entered the apartment. The Boston Globe reports that police found blood and a “message of retribution” on the walls of the apartment, along with photos of the two doctors cut into pieces. Police say the victims and the killer knew each other, but the police have not yet to pin down a motive for the killings, WCVB reports. CBS Boston reports that the apartment building was not lacking in security either  —   the building required the use of a special key to get inside and use the elevator. Field worked as a pain management specialist at North Shore Pain Management where his colleagues said he was known for his “tireless devotion. ” “Dr. Field was a guiding vision at North Shore Pain Management and was instrumental in the creation of this practice, in 2010,” the company said in a statement. They also noted that he “was noted for his tireless devotion to his patients, staff, and colleagues. ” Prior to working at North Shore, he worked as an anesthesiologist and pain management specialist at Beverly Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Bolanos worked as a pediatric anesthesiologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary where she was regarded as “outstanding” in her profession and as an anesthesiology instructor at Harvard Medical School. “The entire Mass. Eye and Ear community is deeply saddened by the deaths of Dr. Lina Bolanos and her fiancé,” the hospital’s CEO John Fernandez said in a statement. “Dr. Bolanos was an outstanding pediatric anesthesiologist and a wonderful colleague in the prime of both her career and life. ” NBC Boston reports that Teixeira will undergo arraignment Monday and that police expect he will face multiple charges. Teixeira recently served nine months out of a   prison sentence for two counts of larceny that he pleaded guilty to in September 2016.",0
20263,20263,Mexican Governor Fighting U.S. Extradition for Cartel Case,Ildefonso Ortiz and Brandon Darby,"The accused   former governor of the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas claimed in Italian court that he does not want to be extradited to the U. S. for multiple drug trafficking and money laundering charges. The politician faces allegations of being a surrogate of Mexico’s Gulf, Los Zetas, and Beltran Leyva Cartels. [According to information provided Italian authorities, Yarrington made a court appearance on Wednesday to announce his wishes against extradition. He will remain in an Italian prison as a flight risk to the U. S. Department of Justice until the matter is settled.   As Breitbart Texas reported, Yarrington was charged out of the U. S. Southern District of Texas on multiple drug trafficking and money laundering charges. The allegations in the indictment point to Yarrington having worked for various Mexican cartels while serving as governor of Tamaulipas. While U. S. agents tracked him down for years, Mexican authorities gave the politician official protection details.  On Sunday, agents with Homeland Security Investigations and Italian police arrested Yarrington in at a restaurant. The arrest was based on the investigation done by U. S. authorities and the Italian government however, Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office (PGR) issued a news release taking credit for the collar and claiming that Yarrington would be returned home.  The claims by the PGR were proven to be lies by Breitbart Texas this week when it quoted diplomatic officials revealing that the arrest was solely a U. S. based operation. Soon after, the PGR tried to backtrack by stating they provided information beneficial in locating Yarrington.  One day later, Breitbart Texas reported that Mexican officials told the DOJ that they would not oppose Yarrington’s extradition to the U. S. While the PGR tried to claim the story was not accurate, Reforma published documents proving that PGR had once again lied. The PGR again issued a series of news releases to “clarify” previous statements.  One release by the PGR revealed that the agency requested Yarrington’s extradition two days after his arrest, while the U. S. acted much earlier. Breitbart Texas has since learned that the request filed by Mexico is only a temporary hold and is not considered a formal extradition document.  In an apparent attempt to ease tensions between the two countries Wednesday, both the PGR and DOJ issued a joint news release claiming they “are working together on a legal strategy which will allow Tomas Yarrington to face justice in both countries. ” Ildefonso Ortiz is an award winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

20266,20266,Cyprus Fears Russian Meddling in Its Settlement Talks - The New York Times,Andrew Higgins,"NICOSIA, Cyprus  —   As the United Nations geared up for negotiations that it declared the “best and last chance” to unite Cyprus after more than four decades of acrimonious division, Russia’s ambassador attended a seminar dedicated to derailing any prospect of an agreement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. The presence of the ambassador, Stanislav Osadchiy, delighted   Greek Cypriot politicians in Nicosia, the capital of the   south of the divided island. They had helped torpedo a 2004 reunification plan supported by the United States and have now rallied together to defeat a new push for a settlement that began on Jan. 12 with an international conference in Geneva. But Mr. Osadchiy’s attendance at the seminar, which Western and other diplomats shunned, angered Nicos Anastasiades, the   president of the Republic of Cyprus and a strong supporter of efforts to resolve an interethnic dispute as intractable and nearly as protracted as the   conflict. In an interview in Nicosia, Mr. Anastasiades said that, when questioned, the ambassador had apologized and said he had misunderstood the nature of the seminar, despite its clear   agenda and the fact that it had been organized by five small political parties all bitterly opposed to a compromise deal in Geneva. The president said he accepted the ambassador’s explanation and his insistence that he had not meant to endorse the   rejectionists by attending. But, Mr. Anastasiades added, “I consider any intervention by any third country as not what we are looking for. ” Like countless previous diplomatic efforts to reunite Cyprus since Turkey invaded in 1974 and split the country in two, the recent Geneva talks failed to achieve a breakthrough, though they did make some progress. Mr. Anastasiades said the two sides were “halfway” to an agreement but still had deep divisions, notably on the issue of whether Turkey, Greece and Britain, the former colonial master, should retain their status as “guarantors” of the island’s security, a setup that Russia rejects. Bound to Russia by a shared Orthodox Christian faith and its role as a financial and banking center for Russian business, the Republic of Cyprus, the   nation in the south of the island, has long looked to Moscow as a protector rather than a troublemaker. But accusations that Moscow intervened to skew the United States presidential election and supported   forces across Europe have stirred a wave of alarm about Russia in the European Union, of which the Republic of Cyprus is a member. This alarm, which Russia dismisses as Russophobic hysteria, has given new force to voices in Cyprus warning that Russia’s geopolitical interests have made it determined to upset a Cyprus settlement. Makarios Drousiotis, a   researcher who has long bucked   sentiment in Cyprus and sought to expose what he sees as Russian meddling, said events in the United States and Europe were shaking his compatriots’ view that Moscow had only their best interests at heart. “What they have been doing in America and Europe they have been doing for 50 years in Cyprus,” said Mr. Drousiotis, who in 2014 published a book, “The Cyprus Crisis and the Cold War,” that demolished what he called a   “myth” that the West is to blame for Turkey’s 1974 invasion of the island and the decades of division that followed. The book, denounced by Russia’s diplomatic mission in Nicosia as “politically unacceptable,” portrayed Moscow as a duplicitous partner that had for decades used disinformation, front organizations and other tools of subterfuge to woo support among   while working behind the scenes to stoke tensions to ensure that Cyprus never aligned too firmly with the West or became a NATO member. To Moscow’s fury, this once taboo view that Russia wants to block a settlement has in recent weeks been discussed openly in some Cypriot media outlets. The Cyprus Mail, for example, described Russia’s ambassador, Mr. Osadchiy, as “the darling” of   forces “because he regularly says things aimed at undermining the talks or making the pursuit of a deal more difficult. ” Maria Zakharova, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said Moscow was “surprised by the   comments in the Cyprus media” and accused the media of creating “a smoke screen for the real problems that need to be tackled as part of the Cypriot settlement. ” Mr. Drousiotis said the Russian ambassador’s apparent support for   rejectionist politicians ahead of the Geneva talks fit a long, but previously mostly ignored, pattern. “Every time there has been an attempt to solve the Cyprus issue, the Russians have jumped in to block a settlement,” Mr. Drousiotis said. A solution in Cyprus would end a deep rift within NATO between Turkey and Greece, both members, and open the way to the development of large gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean that could upset the grip of Gazprom, Russia’s   energy giant, on the Turkish market. Turkey imports nearly 99 percent of its natural gas, more than half from Russia, its biggest supplier by far. Gas from Egyptian, Israeli and Cypriot fields in the Mediterranean would be cheaper than supplies from Gazprom, but it has little chance of reaching Turkish consumers so long as arguments over territorial waters and other matters between Greek and Turkish Cypriots obstruct the development of pipelines. In 2004, ahead of a referendum in Cyprus on whether to accept a reunification plan proposed by Kofi Annan, who was the secretary general of the United Nations at the time, Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution relating to security arrangements on the island that all other Council members supported. Hopes for the   Annan plan then took another big blow when AKEL, the influential   communist party in southern Cyprus, dropped its previous support and, on the eve of the referendum, urged voters to reject the plan, as did the Orthodox Church. In the end, the north voted to accept the plan, while voters in the south rejected it. Yet another international effort collapsed after hackers penetrated the United Nations computer system and, in 2009, leaked emails and documents to a   Cypriot newspaper. Some of the documents were doctored in a way that inflamed   fears of any settlement. The United Nations concluded that only a foreign intelligence service could have orchestrated such an operation. Mr. Anastasiades, speaking at the presidential palace in Nicosia, said that his country counted Russia as a friend, but that it had to take care not to give fuel to those who questioned Russia’s intentions, as the ambassador did by attending the seminar. Russia has responded angrily to accusations that it has been working against its own stated policy in favor of a Cyprus solution. Vladimir A. Chizhov, Russia’s ambassador to the European Union, issued a scathing statement on Jan. 13 to denounce what he called “preposterous” reports that Russia wanted to block a settlement. “Evidently,   hysteria is becoming contagious. Overzealous fighters of the (dis) information front are working day and night trying to implicate Russia in all sorts of problems, including those that are the direct result of shortsighted and arrogant policies of others,” Mr. Chizhov, a veteran diplomat who earlier served at the embassy in Nicosia, said in the statement. Harry Tzimitras, director of the Nicosia branch of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, said many obstacles blocked a settlement irrespective of Russia, notably the gulf between Greek and Turkish Cypriots on the issue of whether the Turkish military should be allowed to keep troops on the island after reunification. “The fundamental mistrust” between the two sides, Mr. Tzimitras said, is the main reason for the failure of decades of diplomatic efforts to reach a settlement. “In Cyprus, you rarely fight facts,” he said. “You fight perceptions and ghosts. ” All the same, he added, some think that Russia has many reasons, despite its public position, to want the island to stay divided. “In this view, the status quo is working very well for Russia,” Mr. Tzimitras said. “They don’t want it disrupted. ” Aside from strengthening NATO and damaging Gazprom, a reunification deal would deliver a success to the United States, whose diplomats have been particularly active in trying to prod Greece, Turkey and their ethnic kin in Cyprus toward an agreement. Mr. Anastasiades said the main obstacle to a solution was Turkey, whose increasingly autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, recently said Turkish troops must be allowed to stay in Cyprus “forever. ” Mr. Anastasiades has forged good relations with the leader of   northern Cyprus, Mustafa Akinci, but, he said, “the solution does not depend on the Turkish Cypriots but on Ankara’s will. ” The issue of troops is tightly connected with another big hurdle  —   demands by Mr. Anastasiades, urged on by Russia, that Turkey, Greece and Britain be stripped of their role as guarantors. Moscow has long wanted to scrap this system, continuing a   policy that was based in part on its desire to weaken the role of Britain, a NATO member that has military bases and a listening post in Cyprus. Mr. Anastasiades said it was up to Mr. Erdogan to decide what he wanted. “His rhetoric is that he is in favor, but what remains to be seen is whether in practice he is supporting a solution,” Mr. Anastasiades said. As for Russia and the United States, Mr. Anastasiades said, Cyprus understands “the games superpowers play. ” “We want the support of everyone who can give support,” he added. “It is a matter of survival. ”",0
20267,20267,Attkisson’s Feb 19 ’Full Measure’ Investigates VA Contractor Accused of Cheating Veterans - Breitbart,Dan Riehl,"On her February 19th episode of “Full Measure,” host Sharyl Attkisson investigates new concerns involving the Department of Veterans Affairs. Attkisson examines allegations in a lawsuit against a Veterans Administration contractor getting millions of taxpayer dollars while accused of cheating veterans. [Cleaning up the   Department of Veterans Affairs was one of the main themes of President Trump’s 2016 campaign.  Attkisson’s “Full Measure” provided Breitbart News the following excerpts of her upcoming show. Born in Iran, David Vatan attended medical school and came to live in the U. S. He got a job in California working for a VA contractor under Lockheed Martin: QTC Medical Services. Vatan’s job was to review medical files of Vietnam vets to see if they’re eligible for payments for injuries from Agent Orange, a toxic herbicide used to remove leaves from trees in jungles where the enemy hid. Vatan: By reviewing their files, I was honored and I felt that I, there is a purpose in what I do and at the end of the day every day, I felt so good if I reviewed a file and I found the evidence that could benefit our veterans. That’s the least I could do. Sharyl: So their ability to get payments or benefits hinged on the reviews that people like you were doing, of their medical files? Vatan: Absolutely. But Vatan says he quickly saw major problems at QTC: large numbers of vets denied benefits after he says their medical files weren’t properly reviewed. Sharyl: What made you think that something wasn’t right? Vatan: I noticed that some of my   are reviewing claim folders a lot faster than I did, and then I realize some of them do not have the necessary background to review and understand the highly complex medical records. And, much to my surprise, some of them had only high school education. QTC got $300 to $350 per file. The faster the analysts worked, the more money QTC made. Sharyl: How many files do you think could reasonably be reviewed in a day? Vatan: Five or six based on my observation. Sharyl: But some people were doing fifty? Vatan: Fifty and sixty. QTC staff emails confirmed the files were being pushed through in what Vatan sees as impossibly fast: “We are running behind,” the staff were told. “We were 30 short. ” “We did not do well yesterday. ” “We need to make it up today. ” Vatan reported his concerns to QTC’s senior leadership and parent company, LockheedMartin. Vatan: I approached the management and I was challenged, and then I approached the Lockheed Martin ethics office. Sharyl How did you tell Lockheed Martin what you thought was wrong? Vatan: I told them I believe it’s unethical, unprofessional and as a result, based on the statistics that they have released, it’s unacceptable. Sharyl: The company was getting a huge amount of tax dollars to conduct these reviews? Vatan: Absolutely. I think it’s close to 50 million dollars. That’s your tax money. Sharyl: What would they say? Vatan: They say, “We’ll look into it,” and they conducted several interviews with me, of course the ethics office did, and they took their time and then eventually they send me an email. They said, “your allegations were unsubstantiated. ” After blowing the whistle, Vatan says he faced harassment and retaliation. QTC’s CEO admonished him for “creating a disruptive work environment. ” He was eventually fired for misconduct, which he denies. Vatan filed a whistleblower suit in federal court, alleging fraud and retaliation. The case was dismissed. He’s appealing. Vatan: I felt that not only they’re defrauding for our government, but also at the same time they’re scamming and screwing our veterans. Rep. Phil Roe,  : If what he says is true, then these claims have not been properly adjudicated. Congressman Phil Congressman Phil Roe, Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, is looking into the handling of Agent Orange claims and Vatan’s allegations. Rep. Roe: I think it needs to be investigated. I think we need to look at it. We certainly have asked the VA for an explanation for it here. QTC has been under scrutiny before. A 2008 audit by the Inspector General found QTC overcharged taxpayers more than $6 million for vets’ medical exams. Yet four years later, QTC got the lucrative government contract to review Agent Orange claims. Rep. Roe: I think the veterans deserve more for the money we’re spending. The VA didn’t respond to Attkisson’s interview requests. Also, QTC declined to comment “due to ongoing litigation. ” Dr. Vatan hopes his story will make the VA and its contractors more accountable, and he still sees the U. S. as among the best countries the world. Sharyl: I see you’re wearing an American pin, an American flag. Why is that? Vatan: I’m proud of this country. It’s one of the safest countries in the world and the safety and security that we all enjoy, we owe it to our veterans because they fought the wars outside of our border in the past. Though QTC and Lockheed Martin wouldn’t talk with Attkisson, their lawyers argued in court, “There is nothing inherently wrong with QTC encouraging people to work quickly. ” QTC said Vatan’s level wasn’t the final say in reviews, because files were then sent to doctors hired for that purpose. They noted that Vatan was part of the first step review, because although he has a medical degree, he did not have a license. The main “Full Measure” website is here and the February 19 show will be available here. “Full Measure” airs Sunday on Sinclair stations nationwide and is streamed live on Sundays at 9:30 a. m.

20268,20268,The Art of Flavor at Flora Bar in the Met Breuer - The New York Times,Pete Wells,"I’m on the verge of giving up trying to explain why Ignacio Mattos’s food is so good. I once wrote that the cooking at his first restaurant, now closed, dabbled in “deep, surrealist weirdness. ” At Estela, the place on Houston Street that put him on the map, I described his food as “almost familiar, but not quite. ” What struck me at his most recent restaurant, Café Altro Paradiso, was “the inverse relationship between prettiness and deliciousness. ” (What I ate was unpretty and highly delicious.) In retrospect, nothing I wrote captured the qualities that made the food compelling. I latched on to visual style because I couldn’t figure out how to explain why the flavors grabbed me the way they did. After spending some time at Flora Bar, which Mr. Mattos opened in October, I’ve started to think that whatever it is that sets his food apart is something you can’t see. It’s a kind of cooking that’s almost invisible. Flora Bar is inside the Met Breuer museum, Marcel Breuer’s blunt and muscular stack of granite and concrete on Madison Avenue in the 70s, regarded as a masterpiece of the brutalist style. “The taste for its disconcertingly   inverted pyramidal mass grows on one slowly,” the architecture critic for The New York Times, Ada Louise Huxtable, wrote in 1966, “like a taste for olives or warm beer. ” The food at Flora Bar is much easier to like than warm beer. Under the direction of Jake Nemmers, the executive chef, it comes out of the kitchen in a series of tidily formal circles and squares. The rough edges of the cooking at Altro Paradiso and Estela have been refined, which makes it even more astonishing when the flavors come at you out of nowhere. A simple red disc on a white plate, Flora Bar’s tuna tartare isn’t like any I’ve had before it pops with toasted flax seeds and crunches with fried shallots, neither of which hides the clean, cold taste of chopped yellowfin tuna. Flora Bar does not quite reinvent tuna tartare the way Estela reinvents beef tartare, but it comes closer than you’d think was possible. Steak comes with béarnaise and beet hunks. The beets look a little wrinkled, like prunes, and have an uncannily focused flavor. The béarnaise is silky and light on the herbs. The steak looks like steak, sliced. It is tender, and the flavor goes on and on as you chew, yet it doesn’t have the   stink of   beef. Something must have happened to make it so extraordinary, but the answer is not visible. (The beef has been given, among other treatments, a surreptitious marination in fish sauce.) How can a shrimp cocktail hold any surprises? Well, there’s the price, $29, which may be a record. But then there’s the astonishingly fine flavor and texture of the blue shrimp themselves, glossy and appealingly slippery on a bed of ice pebbles. They’re terrific, and so is their dark, uncloying cocktail sauce. Note the name. Flora Bar is, when you get down to it, less a restaurant than a wine bar. The plates are almost all small even the steak, which could pass as a main course, is a far cry from a steakhouse portion. Flora Bar is not trying to be a utilitarian cafe for museum patrons who knocked themselves out taking in Kerry James Marshall’s show upstairs and now want a cheap, filling meal. That job goes to Flora Coffee next door, where you can get sandwiches and pastries during the day. The wine list at Flora Bar is about as exhaustive as any artist’s career retrospective. It contains multitudes, and in three visits, I barely scratched the surface. And I left the shelves and shelves of tempting, knowledgeably chosen spirits mostly untouched, apart from the slug of gin that went into my very soothing Tuxedo No. 2 cocktail. As wine bars go, it’s somewhat stiff. The service can be punctilious in a way that I imagine is meant to appeal to the Upper East Sider, but fans of Estela (and there are many Upper East Siders in that group) may find it slightly  . Or Mr. Mattos and his business partner, Thomas Carter, may just be trying to live up to the space. It’s an exceptionally dramatic one, with marble surfaces and banquettes of dark leather and windows the size of billboards that look out on Breuer’s bridge across the moat below Madison Avenue. A sculpture garden when this building still housed the Whitney Museum of American Art, the moat is now an outdoor extension for Flora Bar. I miss the art, but the tables look inviting enough to make me come back when the weather warms up. The menu is part tapas, part sashimi and part something else. On the tapas side, we have wonderfully crunchy croquetas with a soft core of warm raclette, pink shavings of jamón Ibérico, and a plate of anchovies, three cured in oil and three in brine. The quality is impeccable if you can get over paying $18 for six anchovies. I couldn’t. Representing sashimi, there is shimmering raw seafood, some of it on or under squares of nori. You’re meant to treat the nori like a tortilla. A month ago, the filling in this taco was raw scallops and a salty streak of plum paste, and I was quietly happy. When I went back, the nori covered sticky raw red shrimp and sea urchin, and I went completely giddy. It took me a minute to warm up to another raw dish, the lobster crudo. Raw lobster is not something you naturally want to cuddle up with. Here it is chopped with shiso and molded into a disc, ready to be swabbed in a   mayonnaise. It’s refined and almost comforting. As for something else, you tell me how to characterize raclette and golden slices of rutabaga over a thin, buttery tart shell, or an omelet that is in fact cooked in a thin disc, inverted on to the plate   down, and then topped with spoonfuls of hackleback caviar, firm trout roe and crème fraîche. There’s a fine line between simple and dull, and one or two dishes fell on the wrong side. Stracciatella with lemon peel and cubes of fennel struck me as an ordinary burrata salad traveling under an alias. Halibut with wild mushrooms was no more than the sum of its parts, although they were very good parts. Natasha Pickowicz’s desserts sound safe but can be daring. Mandarin sorbet in a kind of cradle made of coconut was served with a yuzu sauce so sour it made me sit up straight. After the initial shock, I loved it. If I’d expected the parfait of chocolate and amarena cherries to be a layered dessert served in a tall glass, like other parfaits, I was wrong. This was   chocolate, as dense as ganache, and served in the shape of, you guessed it, a disc.",0

20270,20270,MILO: Trump Slims Down Lena Dunham. Is There Anything He Can’t Do? - Breitbart,Milo,"Lena Dunham claims (claims!) she is losing weight because Donald Trump has convinced her not to eat. The Catholic church won’t declare a person a saint until after their death, but if this extraordinary statement is true, maybe a miracle of this magnitude deserves an exception? [Dunham revealed the news on the Howard Stern Show, during which the actress went through her tired   routine of explaining that promising to move to Canada was “just a joke. ” She also said Hillary Clinton was “the best qualified candidate we’ve ever had. ”  But in the middle of her schtick, an amazing revelation emerged. Lena said “Donald Trump became president and I stopped being able to eat food  …    Everyone’s been asking like, ‘What have you been doing?’ And I’m like, try   pain and devastation and hopelessness and you, too, will lose weight. ” Now that we’ve collectively pulled ourselves together, stopped guffawing and picked the sick out of our keyboards, let’s unpack that statement for a moment. None of us really believes that Lena Dunham can stay off cheeseburgers for long. But if it is true, Trump’s achievement is on par with curing the sick and returning sight to the blind. You’ll recall that when Lena made disgusting comments about abortion, her excuse was that they were said as part of a “delusional girl persona” she “often inhabits. ” Perhaps these weight loss comments were made as part of another persona, one that doesn’t want to die lonely and far too young due to obesity and feminism  …     but I repeat myself. I’ve had my   with Dunham. Without a doubt she is one of the best examples of how feminism attracts ugly women. I even offered to buy her ticket to Canada before she explained it was all of course just a joke. Before the election, I used my Dangerous Faggot college tour stop at Ohio University to point out something Dunham was serious about  —   the extinction of white men. Maybe the real reason she’s lost her appetite is that she realized her antics directly contributed to Daddy’s election! A reasonable person at this point would say, “Why should we pay any attention to Lena Dunham at all?” And it is a fair question. Her HBO series Girls is long gone, and her lack of comedic chops and acting skill ensures she won’t have a serious career outside of small parts given to her out of pity and ideological sisterhood by   producers and directors. As President Donald Trump correctly put it,”Well, she’s a  . You know, she has no  —   you know, no mojo. ” One could argue she has no mojo because that would be cultural appropriation from indigenous tribes, but either way, she certainly lacks the elusive star factor needed in Hollywood. But I’d argue Lena Dunham is an important person to keep an eye on, even now, because she represents the continued lunacy of the left and the progressive march off the cliff. They’ve doubled down on stupidity, and little lost Lena is a perfect case study of the terrible  . (I say “keep an eye on,” but I mean this metaphorically. Even a few Lena Dunham photos can cause irreparable mental scarring and random malfunctions in the optic nerve.) Dunham has also revealed herself to be something of a chameleon, which is another reason we ought not count her out just yet. Consider the drastic changes she has undergone since the election. In the past she was content to be a typical feminist    and an ugly poster child for the body positivity movement. But since the election she has vomited forth a steady stream of hysteria and worse. Her immediate reaction to the election was to blame her fellow white women for the loss, inventing a new privilege called violent privilege to do so. It is certainly instructive that the sisterhood falls apart at the first sign of trouble. Dunham then posted a selfie while sitting on a toilet in December. It was a torrid cry for help from a frightened little girl  —   not a brave move from an empowered woman. She had no clue why people didn’t applaud her for it, either. Just a few weeks into the Trump presidency and the porcine princess of progressive politics is on hunger strike. What’s not to love? And what could be coming next? It’s all just so exciting. Because the deterioration of Lena’s piddling reserves of sanity is speeding up. Will she next be spotted “punching a Nazi” (i. e. anyone to the right of Jane Fonda)?  Will she run for the Senate against Al Franken, because he isn’t unfunny enough to be the left’s former star in Washington? Who can say! I guess there’s a chance she will calm down and moderate her politics instead of attempting to further divide America.

20271,20271,Trump Calls for Investigation into the Clintons’ Russian Ties,Jerome Hudson,"President Donald Trump took to Twitter Monday evening and asked why aren’t congressional lawmakers probing the various deals, transactions, and connections former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have to Russia. [“Why isn’t the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill  Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech,” read Trump’s first tweet, which was followed by, “  …    money to Bill, the Hillary Russian “reset,” praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!”  Why isn’t the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill  Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech  …    .  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017,    …    money to Bill, the Hillary Russian ”reset,” praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017,  Trump’s assertion that   of State Clinton “allowed big Uranium to go to Russia” and Bill Clinton’s   “Russian speech” were allegations first reported by The New York Times (NYT) and based on research from the NYT bestseller Clinton Cash, authored by Breitbart News    Peter Schweizer. The facts found in Clinton Cash, reported by the NYT, and deemed accurate by establishment media reveal how Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State coincided with the influx of tens of millions of dollars from foreign sources into the Clinton Foundation which resulted in favorable actions for Russia’s government. Indeed the Clinton Foundation had received millions in donations from several investors in Uranium One, a   company in which a majority stake was sold to Russia’s nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, in a lucrative deal needing approval from Clinton’s State Department and eight other federal agencies. “The sale gave the Russians control of   of all uranium production capacity in the United States,” The New York Times confirmed.  The “deal,” as Trump points out, refers to how donations to the Clinton Foundation from executives of   Uranium One had exceeded $145 million, according to the New York Times. In fact, those Clinton Foundation donations from uranium investors spiked just as the deal for Russia’s Rosatom to secure Uranium One was being finalized. A troublesome series of undisclosed donations came from former Uranium One chairman Ian Telfer. Telfer made four foreign donations totaling $2. 35 million to the Clinton Foundation while the uranium deal was being negotiated. However, the Times noted, “those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well. ” “We made mistakes, as many organizations of our size do, but we are acting quickly to remedy them,” The Clinton Foundation admitted at the time. But Hillary Clinton’s failure to disclose the millions in donations her family foundation received from Teller was a direct violation of the Memorandum of Understanding she signed with the Obama administration promising to disclose all foreign donations during her tenure as Secretary of State. More troubling still, was the $500, 000 speech Bill Clinton delivered in Moscow that was paid for by “a Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin” at the time of the Uranium One deal, the New Yorker confirmed. “Why was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was Secretary of State?” asks the liberal publication. Trump’s calls for a federal investigation into the Clintons’ Russia ties come amid a partisan push to link the President and his aides to Russian   and collusion during the presidential campaign.

20272,20272,SHOCK: NYT Goes Gutter… Accuses Trump of Victimizing Little Girl,Wilmot Proviso,"BREAKING: Soros Election Tampering Explodes… Illegally Funneling Cash 
I am very sorry when children have nightmares. I don’t want children to have nightmares. Nobody on Conservative Tribune’s staff wants children to have nightmares. I think I can safely stake that out as our editorial policy without consulting too many of my superiors. 
However, from that starting point on which Ms. Schmidt and I can surely agree, here are two reasons why I believe this story is prima facie bosh. 
Firstly, I question the genesis of this nightmare, and I find it unbelievable that the writer didn’t. Did Schmidt not think that the child’s bad dreams might have been the result not of the perfidy of Donald Trump but of the political leanings and discussions of her parents? If she did, does she not feel that maybe the tone of the piece was out of line? 
Secondly, let’s assume that these parents have been completely unbiased in presenting the election to their children (which I find an unlikely possibility, but hey, it could happen). The world can be a nightmarish place — and unfortunately, one of the things that makes it that way is an extremist movement connected, however tangentially you believe it to be, to their religion. 
If you want to talk about bad dreams, talk to survivors of the San Bernardino terrorist attack . Talk to survivors of the Boston bombing. Talk to survivors of 9/11 . These people have very real nightmares, sometimes each and every night, about very corporeal things done to them in the name of Islam — and they’re the ones who survived . 
These aren’t idle thoughts. They are concrete events. 
For that matter, it’s worth pointing out that the same terrorists probably wish to perpetrate the same nightmarish fate (or worse) on this 7-year-old and her family, simply for the crime of being Westernized. Is this what we wish to ignore in the name of making Donald Trump our national bogeyman? 
If Schmidt is so concerned about the nightmares that Trump’s candidacy is giving 7-year-olds, perhaps she ought to go talk to grown men and women who still have those nightmares, thanks to radical Islamic terrorism. 
If the topic of radical Islamism and how to prevent it is so traumatizing to your children, it’s time to turn off the TV instead of blaming those willing to address it.

20275,20275,UN failed to organize evacuation of civilians from rebel-held Aleppo,nan,"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 08:27 UTC Aleppo destruction Russia's ambassador to the United Nations has criticized UN's failure to properly organize humanitarian evacuations of the wounded from terrorist-held areas of Aleppo. The UN envoy to Syria defended the team, pinning the blame on the warring parties. ""We regret to note that the United Nations has not properly worked out an operation to evacuate the sick and the wounded,"" Vitaly Churkin noted at the UN Security Council session, according to RIA. The ambassador added that the UN work with various opposition groups in Aleppo and the local council was ""left to take care of itself."" He stressed that the UN personnel did not ""exert the necessary pressure"" on ""sponsors"" of illegal armed groups to convince them to cooperate with the aid workers on the ground. Besides criticizing the UN team, the Russian envoy also accused entities that have influence over fighters in besieged neighborhoods of Aleppo of not applying enough pressure on the militants to make the most of the Russian-Syrian humanitarian pause. ""External patrons of entrenched groups in eastern Aleppo could not or did not want positively influence the fighters and convince them to stop the shooting, to release civilians or leave the city themselves,"" Churkin said. The ambassador noted that militants in Aleppo continue to get supplies and arms, including portable surface-to-air shoulder launchers (MANPADs) and missiles. The humanitarian pause was introduced in Aleppo on October 20, as Syrian and Russian jets halted all strikes in the vicinity of the city. While only an estimated ten percent of the city's populace live in terrorist-held Eastern Aleppo, Moscow is doing everything possible to secure the evacuation of civilians. Those civilians who want to leave jihadist-held areas may use six humanitarian corridors. Fighters can also leave the city with their weapons by using two other corridors established by the Russians and the Syrians. However, terrorists have refused to leave and instead resorted to shelling the civilian escape routes. Russian and Syrian planes have stayed out of the city for eight consecutive days. In that time, only a few dozen civilians managed to escape the terrorist-held areas. Meanwhile, the Russian reconciliation centers continued to pour aid into Aleppo. During the Security Council session, the UN official in charge of humanitarian aid defended the world organization's actions in Syria, laying blame at both the rebels, Damascus, and Moscow for not allowing the UN humanitarian assistance to take place. ""The United Nations were ready to launch our operations on Sunday, 23 October. However, objections by two non-State armed opposition groups, namely Ahrar as-Sham and Nureddin Zenki, scuppered these plans. The United Nations made every effort to get assurances from all parties, only for the parties to then fail to agree on each other's conditions about how evacuations should proceed,"" said Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Stepen O'Brien. In the meantime, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent teams working in Aleppo have complained that delivering the humanitarian aid and treating the wounded has been a challenge, as the ICRC failed to ""secure the security guarantees of some armed groups."" Back at the UNSC, O'Brien painted a clear picture for the members of the UN Security Council of human suffering in Eastern Aleppo where terrorists use civilians as human shields. In a graphic yet poetic account, O'Brien said that civilians - mostly children and elderly - are stuck in basements where ""the stench of urine and the vomit caused by unrelieved fear never leaving your nostrils"" is omnipresent. ""Or scrabbling with your bare hands in the street above to reach under concrete rubble, lethal steel reinforcing bars jutting at you as you hysterically try to reach your young child screaming unseen in the dust and dirt below your feet, you choking to catch your breath in the toxic dust and the smell of gas ever-ready to ignite and explode over you."" ""These are constant, harrowing reports and images of people detained, tortured, forcibly displaced, maimed and executed,"" O'Brien added. While mentioning the destructive role of terrorist on the ground, the UN envoy to Syria went out of his way to blame Damascus and Moscow for their air raids. ""Aleppo has essentially become a kill zone. Since my last report to this Council less than a month ago, 400 more people have been killed and nearly 2,000 injured in eastern Aleppo. So many of them - too many of them - were children,"" O'Brien said. ""Never has the phrase by poet Robert Burns, of 'Man's inhumanity to man' been as apt. It can be stopped but you the Security Council have to choose to make it stop,"" the envoy added. Taking the mic at the UNSC meeting, Churkin criticized O'Brien's report, which he said lacked factual information and failed to stress the cessation of Syrian and Russian air raids on the city. He asked O'Brian not to recite poetry but base his reports on concrete facts. ""If we wanted to hear a sermon, we would go to church. If we wanted to hear poetry, we would go to a theater,"" Churkin said. Security Council members wanted to hear ""objective analysis"" of the situation on the ground from O'Brien, the Russian ambassador stressed. ""You clearly did not achieve this,"" Churkin said, reminding O'Brien that no strikes have been conducted over Aleppo since October 18. Calling O'Brian's statement ""provocative and unacceptable,"" Churkin pointed that in the past eight days Syrian and Russian planes had not flown over Aleppo, staying at least 10 km away from the city. ""This moratorium on the flight lasted eight days [now]. Mr. O 'Brian, you did not mention a single word about it. You have built your speech so to paint a picture that aerial bombardment did not stop for one day and that it is happening now, as we speak,"" said Churkin. US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power also criticized the Russian humanitarian corridors in Aleppo. ""Russia made an announcement about 6 humanitarian corridors and urged to take these corridors, including people with arms. But those families were terrified about entrusting their fates to the people who have been bombing their neighborhoods,"" she said. Churkin replied that Power resorted to her usual tactics - ""distorting the Russian stance to the point of absurdity."" ""It is terrifying to live here [in Aleppo]. And the US is asking: 'What can we do?' We told you what to do - to have both Russian and American military work together on Castello road [in Aleppo]. You said no!"" Churkin said. Power and the US delegation, along with the UK, French, and Ukrainian delegations, later staged a walkout as Churkin passed the floor to the Syrian representative.",1
20276,20276,The Lethal Gaps in How the Supreme Court Handles the Death Penalty - The New York Times,Adam Liptak,"Seven of the 12 jurors who convicted Ronald B. Smith in the murder of a convenience store clerk voted to spare his life. When the case reached the Supreme Court, four of the eight justices voted to stay his execution. The arithmetic of capital punishment can seem curious. Mr. Smith was executed Thursday night. Mr. Smith was convicted of murdering the clerk in 1994 in Huntsville, Ala. The jury recommended life without parole, but the trial judge overrode that determination, sentencing Mr. Smith to death. Alabama is the only state that allows such overrides. It is a good bet that the Supreme Court will soon weigh the constitutionality of the practice. That will be too late for Mr. Smith, who came up one vote short on Thursday night, illuminating a lethal gap in the Supreme Court’s internal practices. It takes four votes to put a case on the court’s docket, but it takes five to stop an execution. Over the years, in fits and starts, some justices have sought to address this anomaly by casting a “courtesy fifth” vote to stay an execution when four justices thought the case worthy of further consideration. In a 1985 concurrence, Justice Lewis F. Powell explained his reluctant decision to supply such a courtesy vote. The inmate’s case had “no merit whatever,” he wrote. “But in view of the unusual situation in which four justices have voted” to hear it, he wrote, “and in view of the fact that this is a capital case with petitioner’s life at stake, and further in view of the fact that the justices are scattered geographically and unable to meet for a conference, I feel obligated to join in granting the application for a stay. ” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was asked about the practice at his confirmation hearing in 2005. “How would you feel, if you were chief, if you had four of the justices now voting for a stay of execution?” Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked. “Do you feel as chief you would do the courtesy of kicking in the fifth one?” Chief Justice Roberts seemed receptive. “I don’t want to commit to pursue a particular practice,” he said. “But it obviously makes great sense. ” “You don’t want to moot the case by not staying the sentence,” he added. In the 11 years that Chief Justice Roberts has led the Supreme Court, its commitment to such courtesy votes has been inconsistent. Until Thursday, though, it seemed to be on the upswing. The recent trend started with a case on transgender rights. A Virginia school board wanted to stop a transgender boy, Gavin Grimm, from using the boys’ restroom at his high school while the Supreme Court considered an appeal from a decision in Mr. Grimm’s favor. In August, the court’s four more conservative members  —   Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr.  —   voted to grant a stay. Justice Stephen G. Breyer added a fifth vote “as a courtesy. ” Justice Breyer’s motives were not hard to discern. He was concerned about execution chambers, not restrooms. The only case he cited in his concurrence in the transgender case was Medellin v. Texas, a death penalty decision in which he had expressed frustration that “no member of the majority has proved willing to provide a courtesy vote for a stay. ” Last month, Justice Breyer’s gambit seemed to pay off. On Nov. 3, the court considered an application for a stay of execution from another Alabama death row inmate, Thomas D. Arthur. Chief Justice Roberts provided the fifth vote needed to halt the execution. He said he would not ordinarily have favored a stay, but noted that four justices had voted in favor of one. “To afford them the opportunity to more fully consider the suitability of this case for review,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote, “I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy. ” On Thursday, in Mr. Smith’s case, the court’s more liberal members  —   Justices Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan  —   voted for a stay. But this time there was no courtesy fifth vote. Upon hearing that news, Mr. Smith’s lawyers immediately filed a   request for reconsideration. “The court should not permit executions in the face of four dissents,” the motion said, adding that the court’s practices in this area “clash with the appearance and reality both of equal justice under law and of sound judicial decision making. ” That motion was denied, too, this time without noted dissent. The leading student of the courtesy fifth is Eric M. Freedman, a law professor at Hofstra University. The title of his 2015 law review article on the subject makes his views plain: “No Execution if Four Justices Object. ” On Thursday night, as it became clear that Mr. Smith was going to die, Professor Freedman made a more modest point. The justices, he said, should at the least explain their reasoning and standards. “The time has long ago passed for the court to address forthrightly a situation which is simply unseemly,” Professor Freedman said. “For people to live or die in the middle of the night on the basis of no visible rule is simply at odds with any defensible system of judicial decision making. ”",0

20278,20278,And Then There Was Trump - The New York Times,Thomas B. Edsall,"How do you deal with an opponent immune to the truth, whose appeal is atavistic rather than rational? How do you pick off enough of his constituents and prevent him from making inroads into yours? In Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton and her Democratic allies face a candidate for whom there is no precedent in presidential politics. It remains unclear whether Trump can be brought to his knees the way Mitt Romney was by ads like “Coffin” and “Firms,” which alleged that Romney’s investment firm, Bain Capital, closed factories and shipped jobs abroad. In April, during the primary campaign, Politico reported that Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster currently working for the   “super PAC” Priorities USA Action, contended in a phone interview that Trump’s immunity to criticism worked only in the primaries among Republican voters: “Trump is not Teflon. ” Among all voters, Garin argued, “a majority has come to the conclusion that Trump is unfit for the job and that he would represent a significant risk as president. ” Polling and focus group testing, Garin said, have shown that one ad produced by Priorities, “Grace,” has been highly effective. It shows Grace, who was born with spina bifida, her parents, Chris and Lauren Glaros, and a clip of Trump ridiculing a disabled New York Times reporter. The ad concludes with the father on camera: I asked Garin, along with other strategists and political observers, how they would respond to a long list of Trump’s rambling, theatrical promises, which he would, in fact, be unable to keep. Just a partial list of these includes refusing to defend America’s NATO allies, returning 11 million undocumented immigrants to their home countries, saving $300 billion annually on a prescription drug program that spends only $78 billion a year, nationalizing concealed weapons permits and vowing that “If I become president, we’re gonna be saying Merry Christmas at every store . .. You can leave Happy Holidays at the corner. ” Should Democrats, I inquired, point to the infeasibility of Trump’s proposals and the damaging results of any attempts on his part to follow through? That approach would not work, Garin said, because voters, including many of Trump’s supporters, don’t really “believe he will build a wall, or get Mexico to pay for a wall”  —   they have already discounted many of Trump’s    assertions as hyperbole. “The real case has more to do with his character and temperament,” Garin said. “The biggest concern is that he is temperamentally unsuited to lead the country. ” Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster unaffiliated with the Clinton campaign, argued in an email that there were risks in attacking specific Trump proposals as unrealistic: In an interesting warning to Democrats, Arthur Lupia, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, wrote me: Making a related argument, a Democratic strategist who sought anonymity in order to protect his relationship with the Clinton campaign, wrote me: This strategist cited the futility of accusing Trump of hyping crime: Democrats have to negotiate a tricky path in communicating their candidate’s “identification with the main concerns of many of Trump’s voters” on such issues as immigration, the strategist argued. This empathy has to be Robert Borosage,   of the Campaign for America’s Future, a liberal advocacy group, described the problem of attempting to refute Trump   : Clinton’s task, in Borosage’s view, is not an easy one for a politician who has been in the national spotlight for more than a quarter of a century: “H. R. C. ’s challenge is to claim the future  —   one that is different than the past,” Borosage wrote. In his speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday, Bill Clinton sought to address the issue Borosage raises of how Hillary Clinton can plausibly “claim the future. ” The former president referred to his wife’s record of making “positive changes in people’s lives” and noted that his wife is a “woman who has never been satisfied with the status quo in anything. ” Borosage brought up a second point, that Hillary Clinton, who has campaigned on the theme that she will protect and enhance the Obama legacy, needs to jump an additional hurdle: “Her biggest challenge is to be different than Obama  —   bolder, challenging Wall Street, corporate trade and tax deals. ” Borosage’s argument  —   that the Trump campaign is based on attitudes and ingrained belief systems, not on a set of policies  —   points to the difficulty of addressing Trump’s   rhetoric. Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology at Princeton and the author of “Beyond Smoke and Mirrors: Mexican Immigration in an Age of Economic Integration” pointed out in an email, for example, that Similarly, The Wall Street Journal reported in July 2015 that numerous studies These facts are unlikely to dissuade voters convinced that immigrants are taking jobs, committing crimes and undermining American values. From their point of view, any crime by an illegal immigrant is one crime too many. There are many Democrats who believe that taking on Trump does not require nuance or calculation. “When 60 percent of voters say they’ll never consider voting for you and you have a 29 percent approval rating, you’ve got a serious image problem,” Jim Jordan, who managed John Kerry’s presidential campaign and served as executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, wrote me in an email. “Trump is already gushing blood. This is just blocking and tackling for the Clinton folks. ” Jordan argues that “the two real imperatives” for Democrats are 1) “to deny Trump the ‘I’   ’ space,” and 2) “to keep hammering on how bizarre and dangerous he is to America and our interests around the world. His weird   on Putin and his invitation this week to Russia to invade the Baltics seem like good places to start. ” Despite Jordan’s confidence in Democratic presidential prospects, at the moment Trump has moved ahead of Clinton by 1. 1 percent in the RealClearPolitics aggregation of recent polling. Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at N. Y. U. told me in an email that Democrats need to adopt a more subtle strategy in dealing with Trump. This, Haidt argues, is because the The elephant “really runs the show,” Haidt said, Translating this analytic approach to the 2016 election, in Haidt’s view, means that To counter Trump, Democrats have to get into the electorate’s automatic, intuitive and unconscious level of responding to events before attempting a critique based on reasoned argument, according to Haidt. To do this, he wrote, the goal should be to portray Trump in ways that conflict with “deep moral intuitions about fairness versus cheating and exploitation. ” And how do you do that? The next step is to present a vision of Trump that violates “moral intuitions about loyalty, authority, and sanctity:” On Monday night in her speech, Michelle Obama tapped into this theme when she described “the kind of president that I want for my girls and all our children. ” The first lady declared: Haidt put it another way: I could not have said it better myself. Despite the overt chaos, the competing narratives of the fall campaign  —   each side’s attempt to define the other as weak or crazy and itself as tough and dependable  —   are clearly emerging from the conventions. The question is whether the Democratic Party can get emotional enough or reach deep enough into our brains to counter the sheer id of Trump’s primeval appeal.",0
20279,20279,Activists Urging Obamacare Supporters to Mail Ashes of Dead People to Congress,Warner Todd Huston,"Democrats working to oppose any   changes to Obamacare have launched a morbid campaign to fight the GOP’s American Health Care Act (AHCA) by urging supporters to send the ashes of dead relatives to Washington, DC. [“Millions of Americans rely on protections and coverage from the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare,” the campaign website insists. “The Republicans [sic] new bill will gut these protections and many will die. ”  The site then urges supporters to gather the ashes of dead people and send them along to any Republican member of Congress.

C. “I have the feeling the Capitol building would actually stop” the packages, Salsbury told the paper. But she did say that instead of sending the ashes to Congress, supporters should send them to the district offices back home in any particular congressman’s state. Salsbury is worried that the GOP’s “repeal” of Obamacare will impact people with   conditions, but the GOP’s AHCA does not roll back any of the protections for   conditions, nor does it “repeal” Obamacare in any meaningful way.

TTP, TTIP, TISA 
CETA: “‘I trust that an agreement will be reached in the course of today with Belgium, Wallonia and other parts of the country,’ Mr Juncker told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France” [ Business Times ]. “Some two hours of Belgium negotiations broke up without an apparent agreement early Wednesday, following six hours of similar talks the previous evening.” Reading all the Eurocrat statements, it looks to me like “an” agreement, to Juncker, means an agreement to sign the agreement, CETA, at some future date (so that Thursday’s summit with Justin Trudeau can proceed). 
CETA: “What’s Wallonia’s deal? A primer on its role in CETA’s crisis” [ Globe and Mail ]. ” [Walloon Premier Paul Magnette’s] Socialist Party is under growing political pressure within Wallonia, an economically depressed rust-belt region. The Marxist party has been steadily gaining ground in recent polls, pushing the Socialists further to the left on issues such as trade.” There needs to be a left equivalent for “Always Be Closing.” 
CETA: “CETA has bigger problems than not-so-‘tiny’-after-all Wallonia” [ Rabble. ca ]. “[B]y EU standards it is not all that small. Wallonia’s population is 3.5 million, almost a third of the Belgian total of somewhat more than 11 million. There are seven EU countries with smaller populations. Each of the EU’s 28 member states has veto power over CETA. That is how the EU works – on the Three Musketeers principle, one for all and all for one. If one or more of the smaller member states, such as Slovenia or Estonia, or one of the tiny island states with far fewer than a million people, Cyprus or Malta, vetoed the deal, would we be calling them tiny and insignificant?” 
CETA: “Corporate Sovereignty Helps To Bring EU-Canada Trade Deal To Brink Of Collapse” [ TechDirt ]. This looks like what’s on offer to Wallonia: 
The fact that CETA’s ISDS/ICS remains the most problematic area can be seen from a fascinating CETA document (pdf) that was recently leaked. It’s called the “Joint Interpretative Declaration on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union and its Member States,” and is an attempt to offer additional guarantees that are enough to convince Magnette and other CETA skeptics to allow its signing and ratification: 
This interpretative declaration aims to provide a clear and unambiguous statement of what Canada and the European Union and its Member States agreed in a number of CETA provisions that have been the object of public debate and concerns. This includes, in particular, the impact of CETA on the ability of governments to regulate in the public interest, as well as the provisions on investment protection and dispute resolution, and on sustainable development, labour rights and environmental protection. 
The section on Investment Protection is by far the longest, reflecting the seriousness of the problems there. Here’s a key paragraph: CETA clarifies that governments may change their laws, regardless of whether this may negatively affect an investment or investor’s expectations of profits. Furthermore, CETA clarifies that any compensation due to an investor will be based on an objective determination by the Tribunal and will not be greater than the loss suffered by the investor. 
As that demonstrates, there is nothing new in the declaration. Nobody is claiming that CETA will stop governments changing their laws, just that the massive fines that can be imposed by supra-national tribunals are likely to discourage them from doing so. Similarly, claiming that those fines will be “based on an objective determination by the Tribunal and will not be greater than the loss suffered by the investor” simply confirms the untrammelled power of the tribunal to impose whatever fine it thinks is appropriate. 
Lipstick on a pig. 
TPP: “If the trade deal comes up during the lame-duck session this fall, the two [Vice Presidents] could play leading roles on opposite sides of the debate: Kaine as a potentially significant “no” vote should the pact come up for a vote while he’s still in the Senate, and Biden as President Barack Obama’s go-to guy for shoring up Senate support and casting the tie-breaking vote if need be” [ Politico ]. 
TPP: “The TPP ‘provides no guarantee of equal rights and remedies to migrants for labor violations, no regional task force or other solution to address region-wide trafficking issue and no region-wide restrictions on abusive behaviors by recruiters who prey on desperate workers simply trying to feed their families,’ Celeste Drake, the AFL-CIO’s trade and globalization specialist, said during a call with reporters. While the broader deal does not contain migrant worker protections advocated by the labor group, Malaysia is obligated through a separate ‘consistency plan’ to undertake certain reforms for protecting migrant workers” [Politico]. Weak-ass framing from the AFL-CIO (no surprise here) and terrible reporting from Politico (ditto). The issue with Malaysia is not “certain reforms to protect migrant workers,” and not even “trafficking.” The issue is slavery , which Obama is enabling in order to get the deal passed. Use the word! 
TPP: “Australia could face a growing number of expensive legal claims from foreign corporations if the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) comes into force, a new report has warned” [ Guardian ]. “Dr Kyla Tienhaara, from the Australian National University, said Australia ought to learn from Canada’s experience after it signed the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which came into force in 1994 and led to dozens of legal cases against Canada by US corporations [under ISDS].”

Corruption 
” But Trump’s biggest local political donation [in Chicago] was the $50,000 he donated to Emanuel’s first mayoral campaign” [ Chicago Reader (DG)]. “That donation came on December 23, 2010, a couple months before Rahm was elected. In 2011, Emanuel’s administration approved the god-awful 20-foot-high “T-R-U-M-P” sign that the Donald felt compelled to plaster on his building overlooking the Chicago River. But Mayor Emanuel’s not Trump’s only Democratic pal in town. Trump also hired Alderman Burke’s law firm to handle his tax appeals to Assessor Berrios’s office. Burke then won Trump several million dollars worth of property tax breaks.” There don’t seem to be many degrees of separation between the elites. I suppose that’s why they’re elites… 
Policy 
” A hotelier’s guide to the 2016 presidential election” [ Hotel News Now ]. “Many hotels in the U.S. rely on a flow of legal immigrants to fill a variety of positions. Hoteliers want that pipeline of potential employees to remain open, while avoiding additional red tape to verify their statuses.” 
“Battlegrounds: The Fight for Mosul and Election Day Disruptions” (podcast) [ Foreign Policy Editor’s Roundtable ]. If you want to get a good reading on the insanity that is The Blob , this is the podcast for you. The speakers spend a good twenty minutes discussing the details of Syria and Iraq, concluding that historians will look back on it as “a forty year’s war,” without ever once giving a reason for us to be there . Soothing NPR voices, no anger, a lot of laughter. Smart people. 
War Drums 
“Hillary Clinton Promises A More Muscular Foreign Policy As President” [ HuffPo ]. “As secretary of state, Clinton was an early supporter of arming and training members of the Syrian opposition to fight Assad, a plan that faced resistance out of concern that it would be difficult to appropriately vet fighters and ensure that weapons didn’t fall into the hands of extremists. Today, the program is off to a slow start, with only 54 graduates from the first class, several of whom scattered after coming under attack by an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. As commander-in-chief, Clinton would dramatically escalate the program, she said. ” Who was in charge of the training program? Ira Magaziner? 
The Voters 
“What Do Trump and Marx Have in Common?” [Jochen Bittner, New York Times ]. This is another piece along the lines of the article from the Manhattan Institute’s City Journal that Yves linked to this morning, although it’s not a piece of outright hackery. For example: “When Hillary Clinton calls half of Mr. Trump’s voters a ‘basket of deplorables,’ she sounds as aloof as Marie Antoinette, telling French subjects who had no bread to ‘eat cake.'” But both articles deploy the “angry populists of left and right” vs. the “sensible center” trope (remember that in the Beltway you should never display anger; it’s a strong taboo). Bittner concludes: “Mrs. Clinton has the chance to change, by leading a political establishment that examines and processes anger instead of merely producing and dismissing it.” Obama destroyed hope by not delivering change. And now Clinton is holding the bag for the anger that caused. From the Department of Schadenfreude…

The Trail 
“But academic research has picked up something that thousands of hours of campaign punditry has missed completely: Donald Trump talks like a woman” [ Politico ]. “Donald Trump is a stunning outlier. His linguistic style is startlingly feminine, so much so that the chasm between Trump and the next most feminine speaker, Ben Carson, is about as great as the difference between Carson and the least feminine candidate, Jim Webb. And Trump earns his ranking not just because he talks a lot about himself or avoids big words (both of which are true); according to Jones, he also shows feminine patterns on the more subtle measures, such as his use of prepositions and articles. The key then is not what Trump talks about—making Mexico pay for the wall or bombing the hell out of ISIL—but rather how he says it.” Readers?

“This party was dead before Lincoln got here” [ USA Today ]. “Pity the poor Republican Party, which has been on its deathbed since the age of 2. Never mind that Republicans currently control both houses of Congress, 30 state legislatures and 31 governors’ mansions — this split between Establishment Republicans and Trump Republicans is a sure sign the party will be flatlining any day now. ny day now …”

Stats Watch 
New Home Sales, September 2016: “New home sales in September, up 3.1 percent to a 593,000 annualized rate, proved very solid though sharp downward revisions to both August (575,000 from 609,000) and also July (629,000 from 659,000) do lower the degree of what is still, however, solid strength in the new home market” [ Econoday ]. And: “Overall I view this as a good report, which was slightly below market expectations. Dispite the fact the data jumps around, the three month rolling averages are solidly improving” [ Econintersect ]. And: ” The glass is more than half full. This is very solid year-over-year growth” [ Calculated Risk ]. But: “Data from the monthly NAHB survey has continued to suggest that there are shortages of available lots and labour shortages have also been an increasingly important feature in recent surveys. The new home sales data will reinforce these concerns and there will also be concerns over affordability issues” [ Economic Calendar ]. “[L]abour shortages”… If only there were something… like an invisible hand… to solve this problem! 
MBA Mortgage Applications, week of October 21, 2016: “Purchase applications for home mortgages fell a seasonally adjusted 7 percent in the October 21 week to the lowest level since January” [ Econoday ]. 
International Trade in Goods, September 2016: “In a positive for Friday’s third-quarter GDP report, the nation’s trade gap in goods narrowed sharply in September” [ Econoday ]. “In a negative indication of retail expectations for the holidays, imports of consumer goods fell 1.8 percent following a 0.6 percent decline in August. And in a negative indication for domestic business investment, imports of capital goods fell 3.6 percent… [I]n a negative indication for domestic business investment, imports of capital goods fell 3.6 percent.” And we are a capitalist society… 
Purchasing Managers’ Index Services Flash, October 2016: “Markit Economics’ U.S. samples are reporting a sharp upturn in business this month, first with Monday’s manufacturing report and now with the service flash where the headline index is up nearly 3 points” [ Econoday ]. “The sharp gains for Markit’s samples are a surprise but are still only anecdotal indications. Definitive data on October will be posted next week with the month’s unit auto sales and of course the monthly employment report. ” However: “Even with the stronger than expected surge in business activity, cautious staff hiring continued this month” [ Economic Calendar ]. 
Globalization: “Sluggish global trade is taking its toll on one of the world’s biggest ports operators. DP World reported just 1% growth in container volumes over the first nine months of 2016 at ports it’s owned for at least a year. Modest increases in traffic in Europe were offset by a sharp decline in the United Arab Emirates, where the company is based” [ Wall Street Journal ]. “DP World operates marine terminals on six continents, insulating it from economic slowdowns in individual countries or whole regions. But the company’s geographic reach can’t protect it from weak economic growth around the world, plus the ongoing commodities bust.” 
Shipping: “The Suez Canal’s managers are opening a new front in their fight with the Panama Canal for a greater share of global shipping. Egypt’s Suez Canal Authority is negotiating with large shipping lines to secure payment of tolls three to five years in advance and with a break on pricing, the WSJ’s Costas Paris reports. Egypt has spent billions of dollars deepening the canal and opening it to two-way traffic, but the number of vessels passing through has barely grown amid a slowdown in global shipping” [ Wall Street Journal ]. 
Shipping: “Fundamentals of shipping are changing, warns Danish shipowners boss” [ Splash 247 ]. “Global trade will not double by 2030 as [ Anne Steffensen, director general of the Danish Shipowners’ Association’ and the other organisers of the [third annual Danish Maritime Forum] originally thought at the first forum back in 2014….

Scores of merchants have copied the patented product, using its name, images and labels and undercutting the real Forearm Forklift on price.” 
The Bezzle: “Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings Inc. are cutting companies slack on mergers and acquisitions, an analysis of credit-ratings data by Bloomberg News found” [ Bloomberg ]. “Over the past year and a half, both have bumped up their ratings by two, three or even six levels on a majority of the biggest deals, the analysis found…. Some investors warn the approach has encouraged an epic debt binge that could pose dangers as years of near-zero interest rates come to an end.” 
“In a clear nod to major market-makers’ concerns about the effect of more transparency on cash market liquidity and their own profit margins, Antonio Weiss, a counselor to U.S. Treasury Sec. Jack Lew, told an audience at a market structure conference on Monday that the Treasury market information transparency debate ‘should shift from whether to seek increased transparency to how, when, and on what basis'” [Francine McKenna, MarketWatch ]. “Information on activity in cash Treasury markets is not readily accessible, and regulators lack visibility into dealer-to-customer activity, which, according to some estimates, is over 50% of the cash market.”

Water 
“A perfect storm of aging infrastructure, stretched municipal budgets, and changing climate conditions are putting even more of the country’s water systems under pressure. Faced with the steep cost of fixing their broken and ill-prepared infrastructure, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are turning to private money in their search for an answer to the country’s water woes. While the record of private companies handling water supplies has been mixed, this trend toward water privatization seems to be some kind of tacit acknowledgment that local governments can’t fix the problem on their own” [ Quartz ]. Ideal infrastructure projects, eh?

It concludes with a discussion of several policy actions taken by the Obama Administration to help promote labor-market competition and ensure a level playing field for all workers” [ Council of Economic Advisors ]. How I hate that dead “level playing field” metaphor. Generally, playing fields are level. It’s the refs and the crooked guys with their hands in the till in the front office that I worry about.

20282,20282,The Choose-Your-Own-News Adventure - The New York Times,Jim Rutenberg,"AUSTIN, Tex.  —   A fascinating story emerged about Netflix last week. The Daily Mail reported that the streaming television service was developing new interactive technology allowing viewers to direct the plots of certain television shows,     style. The company later told me that the experiment was focused on children’s programming, more as a developmental learning tool than as some new twist on the modern media sphere’s rush to give you exactly what you want when you want it. No matter how far the experiment goes, Netflix is again in step with the national zeitgeist. After all, there are algorithms for streaming music services like Spotify, for Facebook’s news feed and for Netflix’s own program menu, working to deliver just what you like while filtering out whatever might turn you off and send you away  —   the sorts of   honey traps that are all the talk at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival going on here through this week. So why not extend the idea to the plots of your favorite shows? The Mail even went so far as to envision viewers of the British historical drama “The Crown” making it so that Princess Margaret gets to marry her sister’s equerry, Peter Townsend. Of course, as Princess Margaret knew all too painfully, history saw no such union. But that’s no big deal anymore  —   at least if you consider the way people are being primed to shape the arc of the narratives on their highly personalized electronic screens to suit their own tastes, even if it means banishing inconvenient facts. As Dan Wagner, the Obama campaign data wiz and current Civis Analytics chief executive, put it when I bumped into him here during the weekend, “You used to be a consumer of reality, and now you’re a designer of reality. ” Understanding how that is playing out more broadly will help explain why you and your aunt’s new boyfriend can see the same events unfold in Washington and have utterly different ideas about what just happened. Allow me to direct you to the       news media misadventure of the past week, which I’ll call “POTUS45, Episode 6: The Presidential Wiretap That (A) Was, (B) Wasn’t, (C) Was Because He’s a Russian Agent and Oh, Sister, Is He in Trouble. ” It started with President Trump’s Twitter posts accusing former President Barack Obama of having wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower. Game on. If you were inclined to believe that Mr. Obama did what Mr. Trump said he did  —   indeed, if you wanted to believe it  —   you probably would have tuned into “Fox  Friends” that Sunday morning for Adventure A. There, you would have seen the radio host Mark Levin, whose show was credited with helping to spur Mr. Trump’s accusations, laying out the case for Mr. Trump, declaring, “This is about the Obama administration’s spying. ” The proof, you would have heard him say, was already out there in the mainstream media  —   what with a report on the website Heat Street saying that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had secured a warrant to investigate ties between people in Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, and articles in The New York Times, in The Washington Post and elsewhere about intelligence linking people in Mr. Trump’s campaign to Russia, some of it from wiretaps. “These are police state tactics!” Mr. Levin would tell you. The next day, perhaps your Twitter or Facebook feed turned up a post from the Gateway Pundit  —   recently granted a White House press credential  —   speculating that maybe, just maybe, the F. B. I. director “Let Hillary Off the Hook Because She Knew About F. B. I. Wiretapping. ” As the week unspooled, you would have seen commentary on why Mr. Trump’s charge was so believable (Breitbart) and, shockingly, how it’s even possible that the C. I. A. hacked Clinton campaign email but made it look as if Russia had done it (Bill Mitchell, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity). Sure, you would have picked up static from other sources that made some of this seem ridiculous. But that stuff is for the followers of Adventure B, relying on   journalism from seasoned reporters with deep contacts and established (and, yes, sometimes imperfect) protocols for    —   all of which the Adventure A people view with deep suspicion that the president is only too happy to stir. If you were among the Adventure B folk, maybe you saw James Clapper Jr. the former national security director, tell Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press” that Sunday that the F. B. I. had not secured a FISA warrant to spy on Mr. Trump’s aides. You probably would have seen the news, first reported by The Times, that the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, had asked the Justice Department to deny Mr. Trump’s charge (to no avail) and the viral video of George Stephanopoulos of ABC News telling a presidential aide, “That’s false,” as she tried to reprise the Adventure A argument that mainstream news reports backed Mr. Trump’s wiretap accusation. You would have seen PolitiFact’s    rebuttal of the same argument  —   and, finally, a week later, reports about how evidence for Mr. Trump’s charge still had yet to surface. Or, lastly, were you an Adventure C kind of person? If so, you couldn’t get enough about how Mr. Trump’s wiretap allegation and the Russian connections could lead to his impeachment (MSNBC, The Independent, Maxine Waters) and your Facebook feed probably included the learnprogress. org headline “The F. B. I. Is Now Officially CRIMINALLY Investigating Donald J. Trump. ” (Nothing in the posting it links to shows evidence for any such thing.) As Mr. Stephanopoulos told me when we spoke by phone over the weekend, the trend may have been heading this way for a while  —   you don’t need an algorithmic feed to turn on Fox News or to catch Rush Limbaugh. But in the era of the curated digital news stream, the    phenomenon has “ended up in a whole new place,” Mr. Stephanopoulos said. It’s easy to overdo it, he noted, given that no specially tailored plotline can fully tune out the contradicting details of another one. “Filters do have to contend with each other in some way, too,” he said. Really, arguments between adherents of the different adventure plots are the stuff of cable news programming, with each narrative vying for supremacy in debates that too often become arguments over established facts that should be indisputable. Because, after all, one of the plots we’re talking about here is of the sort that democracy depends on  —   that would be Adventure B, the one based on established facts that exist in the real world  —   and the others are of the sort that threatens to undermine any shared sense of truth while driving us into our corners. At South by Southwest here, a lot of words have been spilled on what to do about it, and just how urgently this multidimensional view of reality needs to be addressed  —   and how to do so. At a Mediapost event on the “  era” I participated in on Saturday, the editor of PolitiFact, Angie Drobnic Holan, said the truth would always come out, eventually. “At some point, evidence and facts will win out over an idea that has no substance,” she said. Our Mediapost conversation wandered into whether the big platforms could inject individual information streams with more   items that might run counter to a person’s baseless beliefs. Intriguing. But there’s not a ton of economic incentive for the platforms to give people what they don’t want. Late Sunday, I checked out a   exhibit presented at the Austin Motel by the digital creative collective the Future of StoryTelling. You could throw on the goggles, become a bird and fly around. If virtual reality can allow a human to become a bird, why couldn’t it allow you to live more fully in your own political reality  —   don the goggles and go live full time in the adventure of your choosing: A, B or C. Just watch out for that wall you’re about to walk into IRL (in real life). Or, hey, don’t  —   knock yourself out.",0
20283,20283,"For Anne Holton, Tim Kaine’s Wife, Elite Circles Are Old Turf - The New York Times",Jason Horowitz,"This weekend, Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, are expected to step off the campaign trail for a beach vacation with their extended family at the Virginia shore. It is an annual tradition, as is Ms. Holton’s practice of making the adults hand over all their grocery store receipts. She ensures that every household, factoring in the number of children, has paid not a dollar more or less than its fair share. “She is not the accountant, she’s the judge,” said her brother Dwight Holton, a former United States attorney in Oregon. “No one has ever questioned her Solomonic wisdom. ” The daughter of a governor who grew up to marry a man who became governor, senator and now   nominee, Ms. Holton has lived since childhood in a world of politics and power. But relatives and friends describe her as being uncommonly unimpressed by the trappings of privilege and instead driven by an almost religious sense of fairness, an aversion to idleness and a   commitment to service that has helped elevate her into   of Virginia’s most famous power couple. As a child, Ms. Holton, 58, had a symbolic role in helping integrate Virginia’s public schools before graduating from Princeton and meeting Mr. Kaine at Harvard Law School. As he rose up Virginia’s political ladder, she achieved renown in her own right as a legal aid lawyer, family court judge and Virginia’s secretary of education, a job she resigned once her husband was chosen as Hillary Clinton’s running mate. In some ways, Ms. Holton, who has been mentioned as a possible replacement for her husband in the Senate, represents Mrs. Clinton’s road not taken, continuing to pursue her career throughout her husband’s ascent rather than waiting her turn. But now those roads have converged on the presidential campaign trail, with Ms. Holton sharing stages with the Clintons and amplifying her husband’s high school teacher vibe with her Everywoman appeal. In a backstage holding room after Mrs. Clinton’s acceptance speech last Thursday, Mr. Kaine broke out his harmonica, one of his hobbies, and goaded his wife into one of hers, clog dancing. On the trail, Ms. Holton is a staple at her husband’s side, monitoring his speeches, giving him encouraging smiles and offering remarks in her lilting accent. “She has been around politics a looong time,” said Tom Wolf, Mr. Kaine’s former law partner and a friend of the family. “And she knows what it’s about and knows what needs to be done. ” Ms. Holton, who declined to be interviewed, first moved into the Virginia executive mansion in 1970 as the    daughter of Gov. A. Linwood Holton Jr. a Republican, and his wife, Virginia, known as Jinks. She enrolled at a prestigious grade school recommended to her parents by their   friends. Many children at school wanted to attach themselves to her because of who her father was. “She called them ‘Buggy Friends,’” recalled her brother Woody, because they were constantly bugging her to visit the mansion. Status seeking, he said, was not a value instilled by their father. Instead, the children were roused from their comfortable beds every morning with refrains of “It’s opportunity time! Let’s go get ’em. ” A Presbyterian, he gave each of his four children Bibles with underlined passages about the good Samaritan. The lessons stuck. When a lightning strike in 1968 killed the daughter of the sitting governor, Ms. Holton started the Becky Godwin Club in the girl’s honor. The club specialized in good Samaritan deeds, like playing with and raising money for a developmentally disabled girl down the block. When a federal judge ordered the desegregation of Virginia schools, Governor Holton sent his children to Mosby Middle, an   public school. He also made sure to alert the news media. “Dad is like Tim in this way,” said Woody Holton, a historian at the University of South Carolina and the author of an acclaimed biography of the first lady Abigail Adams. “They both are really good social justice people, but they also understand that you better call reporters. ” A photograph of Anne’s older sister, Tayloe, being escorted into the school by her father became an iconic image, though Woody Holton said she “was mad because Tayloe was becoming famous wearing Anne’s dress. ” At Mosby, Ms. Holton, then 12, showed a middle child’s talent for getting along with people, starting a cheerleading squad and making friends. She also gave a tour of the mansion to   Slaughter, another    who would go on to be a foreign policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton, and whose best friend was the daughter of the Democrat that Linwood Holton beat in the governor’s race. “She was very gracious,” Ms. Slaughter said. The Holton children entertained themselves by roller skating in the basement, and while Donald J. Trump has criticized “Corrupt Kaine,” as he calls him, for accepting gifts as governor  —   it was legal  —   the Holton children were themselves awash in presents. “When Dad was governor, the gifts just flowed,” Woody Holton said. “This is all before Watergate. Nobody thought how it might be corrupting. So one of the gifts we got was a golf cart, and we drove it all around the Capitol grounds. ” Ms. Holton later enrolled in Open High School, which allowed students to create their own curriculum and did not give grades. When asked to pick an activity for physical education, she took up clogging. When assigned to research her family’s ancestry, she presented not the names of distant gentry, but the names of slaves owned by her  . At Harvard Law, she met Mr. Kaine in a legal assistance program that focused on civil rights protections for inmates, and she worked for the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee, interviewing the criminally insane about the conditions of their imprisonment. “She handled the case of a serial killer,” Woody Holton said. As the couple decided where to live, Mr. Kaine’s family, who lived in the Kansas City area, wooed her by taking her to barbecue meccas. But for ambitious young lawyers, Richmond had its advantages. “He told us that Anne’s dad was the former governor of Virginia,” said Pat Kaine, Tim’s younger brother. Ms. Holton came home first, looking for a church to marry in. She was attending services at a Quaker meeting house at the time, but she knocked on the door of St. Elizabeth’s, a predominantly black Roman Catholic church (her husband is Catholic). She gave her name to the priest. “I tried to play it a little cool  —   we all deal with hierarchy all the time,” recalled the Rev. Michael Schmied, who said they had talked about wedding details for an hour. Then he looked up and remarked: “‘Wow. You are the real Anne Holton. ’” Ms. Holton began clerking for Robert R. Merhige Jr. the federal judge who had issued the desegregation order. As Mr. Kaine became a successful lawyer, a City Council member and mayor, Ms. Holton made a name for herself as a lawyer for   families and foster children, and then as chief judge on Richmond’s juvenile court. Ms. Holton was sometimes so busy that she dropped her three children off at day care in their pajamas. In 2002, she conducted the   ceremony when her husband became lieutenant governor. But before he ran for the office, she had to assuage his concerns about whether they could give a normal life to their three children: Nat, now a Marine Woody, an artist and Annella, who is studying to be an actress. “You’d see Anne tacking up posters to advertise the elementary school and middle school plays,” said Pierce Homer, a former secretary of transportation under Mr. Kaine and a neighbor. The couple live in a modest house and drive sensible cars. Their friends talk about the autoharp Ms. Holton bought Mr. Kaine for his birthday (she plays the violin) and their unapologetic public displays of affection: kissing on stages, holding hands in the park. When Mr. Kaine was elected governor in 2005, Ms. Holton resigned from the bench and returned to her childhood home, where as first lady she concentrated on foster care programs that helped keep older children with permanent families and extend their education. Mr. Kaine won his Senate seat in 2012. When Terry McAuliffe was elected governor a year later, he surprised many people by appointing Ms. Holton as secretary of education, a position she at first declined because of her lack of education background, according to Mr. Wolf, the family friend. “She knew everybody and had a real opportunity to bring people together,” Mr. McAuliffe explained. As for filling Mr. Kaine’s seat in the Senate should he and Mrs. Clinton win, Mr. McAuliffe said, “It will be a little hard since he presides over the Senate. ” (The vice president serves as president of the Senate.) Ms. Holton is clearly at ease among the most exclusive club in Washington. At a retreat at his Virginia farm last month, Senator Mark Warner said, senators were singing along to Mr. Kaine’s harmonica playing when Ms. Holton jumped into the middle of the room and started clog dancing. “Our jaws dropped,” Mr. Warner said. Mr. Kaine told Virginia delegates at a Democratic National Convention breakfast last week that his wife was “my political partner, my most astute critic, my most energetic enthusiast, my lover, my girlfriend, my wife of 32 years, the great mother of our great three children. ” He then kissed her on the lips and relayed to the crowd what the Clinton campaign told him about his wife: “We want every last minute that she can give us. ”",0
20284,20284,Trump Appears to Side With Assange Over Intelligence Agencies’ Conclusions - The New York Times,"Scott Shane, Maggie Haberman and Julie Hirschfeld Davis","■   Donald J. Trump appears to side with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over United States intelligence agencies, with Vice   Mike Pence backing him up. ■ She’s hired: Omarosa Manigault gets a White House post, as do some notable Trump loyalists. But Mr. Trump is leaning on Republican veterans in the Oval Office’s top slots. ■ The   finds something “very strange” about his intelligence briefing on Friday  —   even though the White House says it was always planned for Friday. For the Republican Party, Mr. Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, was once purely a villain. He found little sympathy with conservatives after he leaked American military secrets from Iraq, published purloined diplomatic cables that could have gotten American sources killed and sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, fleeing charges of rape. But now, Mr. Trump appears to be siding with Mr. Assange over the conclusions of America’s intelligence services. Mr. Assange appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night with Sean Hannity, one of Mr. Trump’s biggest news media boosters, to declare once again that the Russians were not the source of the purloined emails that WikiLeaks released from the Democratic National Committee and the personal account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. Mr. Trump followed that appearance with a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released, most likely by Thursday. There were actually two separate hackings that the Obama administration has said came from Russian intelligence  —   with “100 percent” certainty. As he has previously, Mr. Assange said: “Our source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties. ” But Mr. Assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources. It is highly unlikely that anyone approaching WikiLeaks with the emails obtained by Russian government hacking would acknowledge the source, so it is likely that Mr. Assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails. Mr. Assange and Mr. Hannity did not address that, in addition to WikiLeaks, the leaked Democratic material was published by two mysterious websites, DCLeaks. com and a blog written by someone called Guccifer 2. 0. American intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by Russian agents. In addition to American intelligence agencies, most private researchers also say they believe that the D. N. C. and Podesta hackings were carried out on orders of Russian government officials, though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public. Mr. Assange’s statement is unlikely to change that conclusion. Intelligence officials will brief Congress on their Russia inquiry on Thursday, ahead of a briefing for Mr. Trump in New York on Friday. Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will hold the first hearing on the matter on Thursday as well. As for that “terrible” information mentioned by Mr. Trump, the CNN commentator Donna Brazile did send Mr. Podesta an email ahead of a Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich. tipping him off that a woman in the audience would ask why the government was not doing more to help clean the city’s   water supply. That was, in fact, reported widely and often, here and here and here and here, among other places. And that was hardly an unexpected query  —   for Mrs. Clinton or for her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It did cause Ms. Brazile to lose her CNN post. The   appears to be getting a jump on the news. Vice   Mike Pence defended Mr. Trump’s Assange posts at a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday, effectively doubling down on the incoming administration’s icy blasts toward United States intelligence. Mr. Trump “expressed his very sincere and healthy American skepticism about intelligence conclusions,” Mr. Pence said, with House Republican leaders by his side. Mr. Trump’s remarks have again placed fellow Republicans in an uncomfortable position. Asked on Wednesday morning about the Twitter post, Speaker Paul D. Ryan steered clear of criticizing the   saying he would not be commenting on “every little tweet or Facebook post. ” But he called Mr. Assange “a sycophant for Russia,” who “leaks, steals data and compromises national security. ” Mr. Ryan noted that Mr. Trump had not yet received his latest briefing on Russia. “Hopefully, he’ll get up to speed on what’s been happening and what Russia has or has not done,” he said. Ms. Manigault, the villain and diva from Mr. Trump’s reality television show “The Apprentice,” was officially named assistant to the president and director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison, one of a slate of Wednesday appointments that went to ardent Trump loyalists. The appointments include Bill Stepien, a confidant of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and a figure in the “Bridgegate” scandal, who will be White House political director. Keith Schiller, who was head of private security at Mr. Trump’s real estate company, will be director of Oval Office operations. John DeStefano, a longtime aide to former House Speaker John A. Boehner, will direct presidential personnel. And George Gigicos, who organized those giant campaign rallies, will be director of advance, a further indicator that Mr. Trump plans to continue that sort of thing as president. But for star power, no one is going to beat Ms. Manigault. Ms. Manigault aside, Mr. Trump is turning to some seasoned veterans to run key operations in his White House. Mr. Trump announced on Wednesday that he had selected Joe Hagin, who served for 14 years in the White House under Roanld Reagan, George Bush and George W. Bush, as his deputy chief of staff for operations, a key post in which he will be responsible for organizing presidential trips and security, among other things. He named Rick Dearborn, who has 25 years of experience on Capitol Hill, as his chief liaison to Congress, heading the Office of Legislative Affairs as well as the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Cabinet Affairs. Katie Walsh, who was chief of staff at the Republican National Committee under Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s incoming chief of staff, will become his deputy at the White House, overseeing senior staff, scheduling and the Office of Public Liaison. In a statement, Mr. Priebus called the three a “team of doers” who would fill critical roles. Kellyanne Conway, who served as counselor to Mr. Trump, said she was thrilled to have “another strong female leader” on the team in Ms. Walsh. First, Mr. Trump said that the nation should move beyond talk of Russian interference in the presidential election, but that he would listen to what American intelligence experts had to say. Then, on New Year’s Eve, the   promised that by Tuesday or Wednesday, he would reveal information on the hacking that Americans do not know. And now, he seems to think the intelligence community has not quite gotten its story straight. The Obama administration quickly let it be known that, in fact, intelligence leaders always intended to brief Mr. Trump on Friday in New York. And intelligence officials were not amused. Nor were some Republican political consultants. But this is not the first time the   has taken a swipe at the intelligence community, which has concluded that Russia tried to help get him elected president. President Obama is on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to plot a strategy to save his signature domestic achievement, the Affordable Care Act. Vice   Mike Pence countered with his own visit to congressional Republicans. “The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare,” Mr. Pence said. “It needs to be done. ” And Mr. Trump weighed in on Twitter, trying to stiffen Republican spines as Democrats press their point that a fast gutting of the law will endanger the health care of 20 million people covered under the law and put at risk tens of millions more with   health problems. “Schumer clowns” may not be an olive branch to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the new minority leader, but it is a signal that the incoming president is ready for war over health care. “Republicans should stop clowning around with Americans’ Medicare, Medicaid and health care,” Mr. Schumer responded after meeting with the president. He warned that Republicans would “throw the entire health care system into chaos. ” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, tried to coin a phrase: “Make America sick again? Is that what Republicans want?” The Trump transition office named the lawyer Jay Clayton to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The last time Mr. Trump held a real news conference was on July 27, when he said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had called him a genius and wrongly insisted that “many people” saw bombs strewn all over the floor of the San Bernardino, Calif. attackers’ home and failed to report it. That long stretch without a real news media grilling did not do him much harm. He did, after all, win the election. But he says he will hold a true, open news conference next Wednesday. No word yet whether this session will take the place of the one he scheduled for last month, then canceled, to specifically reveal his plans for the future of his corporation.",0

20286,20286,Harry Reid and Koch Brothers Wage Proxy War for a Nevada Senate Seat - The New York Times,Carl Hulse,"LAS VEGAS  —   Nevada’s Senate race could not get much bigger. It is the only real chance Republicans have to flip a Democratic seat. The outcome could seal control of the Senate. For those who have followed the intrigue of recent campaign cycles, it is riveting for another reason. The battle to choose a successor to Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader, is pitting Mr. Reid and his   political operation against his archenemies, Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire industrialist brothers whom Mr. Reid has spent the past few years denouncing as the avatars of   politics. This is an epic proxy war, with Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat and a former Nevada attorney general, and Representative Joe Heck, a Republican, serving as surrogates in a clash to see who gets the last word in this brutal rivalry. Both sides, as they say around the Texas Hold ’Em tables here in America’s gambling capital, are all in. “I am going to do everything I can do to prevail, to help her prevail,” a determined Mr. Reid said in an interview at his home in nearby Henderson, Nev. as he takes on a more visible role in the Senate fight. For their part, leaders of the Koch network, which has at least four groups working to defeat Ms. Cortez Masto, do not disguise the fact that they would sorely like to knock off Mr. Reid’s chosen successor to exact a bit of revenge and to help Republicans hold the Senate. “It would certainly be poetic justice to see Harry Reid, who for so long has waged an unhinged personal vendetta against people we care a lot about, to see his seat go to someone who supports limited government, free speech,” said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, the   group mounting an extensive ground game against Ms. Cortez Masto. With polls showing the Nevada race close, Mr. Reid has become pretty caustic with his own speech when it comes to the Kochs and their preferred candidate, Mr. Heck, a   House member and a former state lawmaker. The Senate minority leader, who for years has taken to the Senate floor to assail the Kochs for taking advantage of campaign finance laws to covertly funnel money into defeating Democrats, seems more than willing to go on the attack for Ms. Cortez Masto, who chooses her own words very carefully. While receiving an award on Thursday from a progressive group whose leadership praised him for “holding the Koch brothers accountable,” Mr. Reid declared that the goal of the Kochs and their allies was to turn the United States into an oligarchy with a chosen few running the nation for their personal benefit. “They want to make sure that they pick the next Supreme Court justices,” said Mr. Reid, who regularly refers to Mr. Heck as a fraud and a phony. And he lashed out at Mr. Heck for being behind an advertising campaign that blamed Ms. Cortez Masto for a rise in violent crime even though the state attorney general in Nevada has little to do with local law enforcement. “Heck is an absolute stooge for these   nut cases,” Mr. Reid said. The Heck camp dismisses Mr. Reid’s comments as    criticism that will backfire with Nevada voters already familiar with the congressman. They say the combative tone reflects Mr. Reid’s rising fear about losing the seat, which could be interpreted as a rejection of his   career in the Senate. “It is clear that in terms of both outside help and   that Harry Reid is calling in every favor and connection he has and that this is about continuing his legacy,” said Brian Baluta, a spokesman for Mr. Heck. The Heck campaign is eager to link Ms. Cortez Masto to Mr. Reid, and at times it can be hard to tell from its Twitter feeds whether it is running against her or Mr. Reid. Mr. Baluta is correct that outside groups are supporting Ms. Cortez Masto, including the League of Conservation Voters and the Senate Majority PAC, a group run by Democrats with connections to Mr. Reid that has spent nearly $2. 5 million on ads against Mr. Heck. But Mr. Heck is receiving help from outside the state as well. Freedom Partners Action Fund, which relies on considerable Koch funding, reports that it has spent more than $4. 5 million against Ms. Cortez Masto. Concerned Veterans for America, another part of the Koch network, earlier ran more than $700, 000 in ads on behalf of Mr. Heck, a military veteran. Mark Holden, the chairman of Freedom Partners and general counsel to Koch Industries, said the Koch network was backing Mr. Heck because he supported policies that would “help drive a free and open society. ” “This will be a welcome change from the petty bitterness of Senator Reid, and the divisive and harmful policies that he favored, which Ms. Masto also supports,” Mr. Holden said. As for the ground game, Americans for Prosperity has three offices in the state, plans on opening a fourth and intends to marshal hundreds of volunteers to go door to door to reach out to voters identified as being open to opposing Ms. Cortez Masto. “Our No. 1 goal is to educate voters on her record,” said Adam Jones, the state director of the group, as young volunteers bustled around the organization’s headquarters in a strip mall. The Libre Initiative, another group partly funded by Freedom Partners, is for the first time actively opposing a candidate and hopes to mobilize Hispanic voters against Ms. Cortez Masto in a race where the Latino vote will be crucial. The stance means the organization, formed to promote economic opportunity for Latinos, will be trying to defeat the woman who would be the first Latina elected to the Senate. “A     Latina is still a     liberal,” said Dan Garza, the executive director of the group. Mr. Heck is generally seen as having a slight edge in the race at the moment and is being helped by the fact that Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who was endorsed by Mr. Heck, has not fallen as far in Nevada as he has in other swing states. Reflecting Democratic concern, some Reid staff members, including Kristen Orthman, his communications director, are being dispatched to the state party to bolster the final Democratic push. Mr. Reid, who concedes he can sometimes be “harsh” in his comments, remains confident that Democrats will hold his seat. And he takes pride in the fact that it is such a target of the Kochs. “I think people are not only identified by their friends, but also their enemies,” said Mr. Reid, who promised to stay as aggressive in protecting his seat as he has been in his   feud with the Kochs. “Say what you want about me  —   and people do  —   but as my dad said, ‘If you do something, don’t do it ’” Mr. Reid said. “Just do it. ”",0
20287,20287,Michael Moore’s ‘Morning After To-Do List’ Is Going Viral – Maybe This Time We Will Listen,Blanche Benson,"  
He called it. Many times. 
Michael Moore, the controversial documentary filmmaker, is a staunch Democrat and Clinton supporter, but has been saying all along that Trump was going to win. 
On Real Time with Bill Maher in July, Moore cried out, “Get out of your bubble, people!” He listed five reasons why Trump was going to be the next president and he was creepy correct. 
For example, his first reason ‘The Rust Belt/Brexit Strategy’ played out before our eyes last night: 
“Mitt Romney lost by 64 electoral votes. The total votes of [Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania ]… 64. All he (Trump) has to do is win those four states.” 
You can check out the whole list, explained in detail, here . 
And during a talk posted on Youtube on October 24 th , Moore also explained why Trump was gonna win. 
But the ever-optimistic Moore is not wasting his time saying, “I told you so.” Instead, he has put out a call for action. On his Facebook page, he posted a to-do list and it looks like this time people are listening. The posting has gone viral, with 218K reactions, 10K comments and almost 100K shares on Facebook alone. 
So, without further ado… Michael Moore’s Morning After To-Do List: Take over the Democratic Party and return it to the people. They have failed us miserably Fire all pundits, predictors, pollsters and anyone else in the media who had a narrative they wouldn’t let go of and refused to listen to or acknowledge what was really going on. Those same bloviators will now tell us we must “heal the divide” and “come together.” They will pull more hooey like that out of their ass in the days to come. Turn them off. Any Democratic member of Congress who didn’t wake up this morning ready to fight, resist and obstruct in the way Republicans did against President Obama every day for eight full years must step out of the way and let those of us who know the score lead the way in stopping the meanness and the madness that’s about to begin. Everyone must stop saying they are “stunned” and “shocked.” What you mean to say is that you were in a bubble and weren’t paying attention to your fellow Americans and their despair. YEARS of being neglected by both parties, the anger and the need for revenge against the system only grew. Along came a TV star they liked whose plan was to destroy both parties and tell them all “You’re fired!” Trump’s victory is no surprise. He was never a joke. Treating him as one only strengthened him. He is both a creature and a creation of the media and the media will never own that. You must say this sentence to everyone you meet today: “HILLARY CLINTON WON THE POPULAR VOTE!” The MAJORITY of our fellow Americans preferred Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Period. Fact. If you woke up this morning thinking you live in an effed-up country, you don’t. The majority of your fellow Americans wanted Hillary, not Trump. The only reason he’s president is because of an arcane, insane 18th-century idea called the Electoral College. Until we change that, we’ll continue to have presidents we didn’t elect and didn’t want. You live in a country where a majority of its citizens have said they believe there’s climate change, they believe women should be paid the same as men, they want a debt-free college education, they don’t want us invading countries, they want a raise in the minimum wage and they want a single-payer true universal health care system. None of that has changed. We live in a country where the majority agree with the “liberal” position. We just lack the liberal leadership to make that happen (see: #1 above). Let’s try to get this all done by noon today.

20288,20288,"After Drug Tests, Is Anyone Left in the Weight-Lifting Room? - The New York Times",Jeré Longman,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The brothers Dan and Anthony Rigney of Australia attended the Olympic weight lifting competition on Sunday and were not exactly mortified that the sport is more polluted than Guanabara Bay. Sure, they want athletes to be   but they also want to be entertained by raw human power. So yes, they would have preferred to see the Russian and Bulgarian teams, which were barred for doping. Likewise with Ilya Ilyin, a suspended   Olympic champion from Kazakhstan, who is the Barry Bonds of the clean and jerk. “You like to see world records,” said Dan Rigney, 28, a physiotherapist and competitive lifter from Sydney. “It’s like baseball. People just want to see home runs. ” There has long been a    pragmatism about weight lifting. Drugs have been a hushed but vital part of doing business. If there is an argument to be made that any sport should permit doping, or even make it mandatory, that sport is weight lifting. “Maybe it already is,” Dan Rigney said with a laugh, adding that, in his view, doping “is what’s keeping the Olympics going. ” Let’s be honest. We don’t want to see anybody lift a keg. We want to see someone hoist a Buick. We are nostalgic for champions like Vasily Alekseyev, the great Soviet superheavyweight who won gold medals in 1972 and 1976. He set 80 world records and was the first person to lift 500 pounds in the clean and jerk. He was so massive that his uniform fit like a chin strap on a bowling ball. And those sideburns  —   great thickets wide and deep enough to plant potatoes. Oh, sure, we say we are against doping in sports. But we don’t care enough to stop buying tickets or watching on television. And let’s ask ourselves this: Would anyone stay tuned if the Olympic champion ran the 100 meters in 15 seconds instead of nine? Who would watch the N. F. L. if linemen were built more like Gilligan than the Skipper? Most fans seem to view doping in the same way they view special effects in “Star Wars” movies, said Charles Yesalis, a retired Penn State professor and an expert on   drugs. “It enhances the enjoyment of viewing because you see    people doing    things,” Dr. Yesalis said in a recent interview. “If everybody looked like normal people, chances are the N. C. A. A. the N. F. L. and the Olympics would not be   entities. ” Before the Games, international sports officials tossed out assorted male and female lifters from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Cyprus, Kazakhstan, Moldova, North Korea, Romania, Turkey, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, a Fodor’s guide through the world of banned substances. Olympic weight lifting without Russia and Bulgaria is like Harry Potter without Lord Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange (if those villains wore spandex and had necks the size of Easter hams). The competition will go on, but it won’t be the same. Until recently, weight lifting officials had mostly turned the other way, keenly understanding that the final word of the Olympic motto, “Faster, Higher, Stronger,” is not easily achieved over the counter. Of course, with the Rio Games upon us, the International Weightlifting Federation is suddenly affronted. It has called revelations of widespread doping in Russia “shocking and disappointing” and has said that the “integrity of the weight lifting sport has been seriously damaged. ” Integrity? Now they worry about integrity? There were 24 positive tests at the world weight lifting championships last year, and retesting of urine samples from the 2008 Beijing Games and the 2012 London Games revealed at least 20 additional positives, including four from Olympic champions, according to the news agency Agence  . Essentially, comedy has become reality. Remember that “Saturday Night Live” sketch, with Phil Hartman playing a Soviet weight lifter named Sergei Akmudov at the All Drug Olympics? “His trainer has told me that he’s taken anabolic steroids, Novocain, NyQuil, Darvon and some sort of fish paralyzer,” the announcer, played by Kevin Nealon, says earnestly. “Also, I believe he’s had several cocktails within the last hour or so,” the announcer says. “All this, of course, is perfectly legal at the All Drug Olympics. In fact, it’s encouraged. ” Akmudov tries to lift more than 1, 500 pounds, triple the world record in the clean and jerk, except for one small problem. “Oh, he’s pulled his arms off!” the witless announcer yells. “He’s pulled his arms off! That’s got to be disappointing to the big Russian. ” With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dismantling of the Soviet Union, the Olympics lost a gripping appeal for many Americans  —   the rivalry between East and West. With Russia now absent from Rio in weight lifting and track and field, that enthralling tension erodes further still. “There was no one to root against,” Matt Futterman wrote last month in The Wall Street Journal, lamenting the parting of the Iron Curtain for international sport. “It was like watching a Bond film in which everyone was working for MI6. ” One wonders whether medals won in Rio will be devalued in particular sports, as they were when the United States boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics and the Soviet Union reciprocated at the 1984 Los Angeles Games. “Weight lifting is so riddled with doping problems, it’s hard to call any medal devalued,” said Bill Mallon, an Olympic historian. And to be sure, many people in weight lifting have applauded the mass suspensions. “Rules are rules,” said Mika Tiainen, Finland’s Olympic coach. “Lifting makes the competition, not the country. ” Still, it would surprise no one if the retesting of urine samples from Rio led to the stripping of medals in coming years. Anthony Rigney, 33, a teacher, said he had seen a meme online: “I can’t wait until 2024 to see who won the gold in Rio. ”",0
20289,20289,"Übrige Wrestler überlegen, wann sie Tim Wiese endlich sagen sollen, dass alles abgesprochen ist",noreply@blogger.com (Der Postillon),"Freitag, 4. November 2016 Übrige Wrestler überlegen, wann sie Tim Wiese endlich sagen sollen, dass alles abgesprochen ist München (dpo) - Früher oder später wird Tim Wiese die Wahrheit erfahren müssen. Doch noch rätseln seine Wrestler-Kollegen, wann sie den Ex-Nationaltorwart am besten wissen lassen sollen, dass sein Sieg bei seinem Debüt als Profi-Wrestler in der Münchner Olympiahalle von vornherein abgesprochen war . ""Tim hat sich so ins Zeug gelegt für seinen ersten Kampf, da will ich echt nicht der sein, der ihm jetzt erklären muss, dass unsere Gegner absichtlich verloren haben und alle außer ihm vorher Bescheid wussten"", erklärt WWE-Superstar Cesaro, der gemeinsam mit Wiese (""The Machine"") und Profi-Wrestler Sheamus gegen das Duo The Shining Stars und Bo Dallas antrat. Zaghafte Versuche, Tim Wiese darüber aufzuklären, dass beim Wrestling alles abgesprochen ist, seien in der Vergangenheit fehlgeschlagen. Cesaro: ""Ich habe Tim letztens erst gefragt, ob ihm klar ist, dass das alles Show ist."" Daraufhin habe Wiese genickt und geantwortet: ""Jaja, geile Show. Ich muss jetzt noch trainieren, damit ich nicht verliere."" Dann sei Wiese im Fitnessstudio verschwunden. Cesaro und seine Kollegen hätten schließlich der Einfachheit halber beschlossen, den kompletten ersten Kampf um Tim Wiese herum zu choreografieren, damit er weiter seinen Traum leben kann.

Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/al-gore-made-nearly-200-million-from.html Ten years after the release of Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth, none of the film's dire climate change predictions have come to pass. However, in the decade since the documentary was produced, its creator has raked in millions of dollars from the entire ""global warming"" scam, and is now poised to become "" our first carbon billionaire .""In the 2006 film, Gore made a number of wild claims regarding what we could expect to see happening over the next few years due to global warming, but virtually all of his alarmist prognostications have turned out to be false. Arctic didn't melt, polar bears are thriving For instance, the film predicted that that the Arctic could become ice-free within the next decades, and that polar bears would begin drowning. Both claims were untrue.As reported by Investor's Business Daily:""In the mid- to late-2000s, Gore repeatedly predicted that an ice-free Arctic Ocean was coming soon.""But as usual, his fortune-telling was wrong. By 2014, Arctic ice had grown thicker and covered a greater area than it did when he made his prediction.""And the polar bears?The Daily Caller reports:""A new study by Canadian scientists once again debunks the notion polar bears are currently being harmed by global warming. Researchers with Canada's Lakehead University found 'no evidence' polar bears are currently threatened by warming ."" Kilimanjaro's snow hasn't disappeared Another prediction made in the film was that Mt. Kilimanjaro would be snow-free ""within the decade."" But in fact:""In 2014, ecologists actually monitoring Kilimanjaro's snowpack found it was not even close to being gone. It may have shrunk a little, but ecologists were confident it would be around for the foreseeable future."" Extreme weather has failed to materialize In Inconvenient Truth, Gore also forecasted that storms would begin occurring more often and at higher intensities.Wrong again, Al:""Gore's claim is more hype than actual science, since storms aren't more extreme since 2006. In fact, not even findings from the United Nations's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) support Gore's claim.""The IPCC found in 2013 there 'is limited evidence of changes in extremes associated with other climate variables since the mid-20th century.' ""The IPCC also found 'no significant observed trends in global tropical cyclone frequency over the past century' and '[n]o robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin.'""Gore should probably take these findings seriously since he shared the Nobel Prize in 2007 with the IPCC for its work on global warming."" Despite false claims, Gore grows richer from climate change myth Although Gore's claims have been thoroughly debunked by a number of experts, he has been quietly amassing a huge fortune based on the climate change scam.Mad World News reports:""Gore's wealth went from $700,000 in 2000 to an estimated net worth of $172.5 million by 2015 thanks to his environmentalist activism. Gore and the former chief of Goldman Sachs Asset Management made nearly $218 million in profits between 2008 and 2011 from a carbon trading company they co-founded. By 2008, Gore was able to put a whopping $35 million into hedge funds and other investments."" Science Fights Back:",1
20291,20291,"Survival of Sears and Kmart Is in Doubt, Owner Warns - The New York Times",Carlos Tejada,"The corporate owner of Sears and Kmart said on Tuesday that there was “substantial doubt” that it could continue operating, as    stores continue to face challenges in an   world. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the corporate owner, Sears Holdings Corporation, cited its efforts to cut costs, sell property, tap new funding sources and make other moves to stanch the flow of red ink. Still, it reported a $2. 2 billion loss for last year and said it had to use money from its investments and financing activities to fund operations. “Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” it said in the filing, its annual report. The disclosure is a setback for the company and for Edward S. Lampert, the hedge fund manager who engineered the combination of the two legends of American retail 13 years ago. Mr. Lampert has shut down stores, reshuffled the company’s organization and pushed to have a greater online presence. Still, Sears Holdings has lost more than $5 billion over the last three years as sales have declined. On Wednesday morning, in the first day of trading after the disclosure, shares in the company tumbled more than 13 percent. Sears, through its catalog, has been a fixture of American homes for more than a century. Kmart, which has its own lengthy history beginning as a    store in Detroit, became a major national presence in the 1960s as a   department store, with Blue Light Special discounts geared toward     Americans. But both brands were squeezed by Walmart Stores, with its heavy discounts, and Target, which sold affordable goods but with more design and flair. Both Sears and Kmart also suffered because they were in older shopping malls and neighborhoods. Online retailing, with the rise of the likes of Amazon, presented a more recent challenge. To cope, Sears Holdings has been shrinking. This month, it sold its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black  Decker in a deal valued at more than $775 million. Still, its   debt as of January totaled nearly $4. 2 billion, almost double from the same period the previous year, according to the filing. In February, Sears Holdings said it had started a restructuring program that it said would save $1 billion annually. The plan focuses on streamlining   corporate and support functions, tweaking product offerings and supply chain and looking for ways to reshuffle real estate. As of January, Sears Holdings said, it had 1, 430 Sears and Kmart stores in the United States. By contrast, a decade ago it had about 3, 800 stores in the United States and Canada.",0
20292,20292,Economists Are Losing Their Minds At Trump’s Plan To Get 3% Economic Growth Again - Breitbart,John Carney,"President Donald Trump’s budget proposal forecasts that the administration’s policies will accelerate the American economy into an era of 3 percent growth for as far as the eye can see. That’s unleashed a torrent of criticism from mainstream economists who can’t stand the idea that Trump could grow the economy at such as fast pace. [According to the budget documents released by the White House Tuesday, the U. S. gross domestic product will reach an annual growth rate of 3% by 2021 and then cotinue growing at that pace. This economic acceleration is the key to the Trump administration’s plans to cut taxes while also reducing the budget deficit.  “Everything is keyed to getting us back to 3 percent,” White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters this week. Even though the average growth rate since the   War II era has been 3. 2 percent, the administration’s critics are skeptical or even mocking of its GDP forecast. They point out that last time the economy grew at 3 percent in a year was 2005 and ever since the Great Recession the economy appears to be on a permanently slower track. Official estimates from the Office of Management and Budget and the Federal Reserve, as well as those by many private forecasters, see growth closer to 2 percent or even lower. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said it was only possible to believe in the Trump administration’s growth forecast “if you believe in tooth fairies and ludicrous   economics. ” Former OMB head Jim Nussle said 3 percent is “unrealistic. ” Alice Rivlin, former vice chair of the Federal Reserve and founding director of the Congressional Budget Office, was more polite, saying that “more responsible” projections would forecast growth around 2 percent. The backlash against Trump’s growth forecast stands in marked contrast to the reaction to the assumptions in Barack Obama’s first budget. The Obama administration’s economic projections were constructed by economist Christina Romer, the head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Romer assumed GDP would grow by 3. 2 percent in the second year of the administration, followed by 4. 0 percent and then 4. 6 percent. As it turned out, growth never rose above 3 percent during the administration. This failure may explain why so many mainstream economists think 3 percent growth is out of reach. In the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession,   at the Federal Reserve launched a series of interventions intended to stimulate more vigorous economic growth. Even when combined with a rising federal budget deficit, however, these monetary policy moves had much less effect than expected. Many economists concluded that we had entered an era of   slower growth. Larry Summers famously described it as an era of “secular stagnation. ” There always was a hint of   rationalization in this view. When the mainstream economists saw that the economy was not responding to monetary policy and as strongly as their theory said it should, they decided that something was wrong with the economy rather than their theory. It was the American economy that was broken rather than American economics. Trump’s budget once again provides a challenge to their views. If it turns out that a combination of tax cuts, better trade policies, a revival of manufacturing and regulatory reform can spur faster economic growth, mainstream economists will appear to be the court of a naked emperor. Not only will their policies have been proven ineffective, their diagnosis of our economic malaise will have been shown to be wrong. No wonder they are so mad.  ",0

20294,20294,"Bob Dylan Wins Nobel Prize, Redefining Boundaries of Literature - The New York Times","Ben Sisario, Alexandra Alter and Sewell Chan","Half a century ago, Bob Dylan shocked the music world by plugging in an electric guitar and alienating folk purists. For decades he continued to confound expectations, selling millions of records with dense, enigmatic songwriting. Now, Mr. Dylan, the poet laureate of the rock era, has been rewarded with the Nobel Prize in Literature, an honor that elevates him into the company of T. S. Eliot, Gabriel García Márquez, Toni Morrison and Samuel Beckett. Mr. Dylan, 75, is the first musician to win the award, and his selection on Thursday is perhaps the most radical choice in a history stretching back to 1901. In choosing a popular musician for the literary world’s highest honor, the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, dramatically redefined the boundaries of literature, setting off a debate about whether song lyrics have the same artistic value as poetry or novels. [ Our pop critic on Bob Dylan, the musician | Our book critic on Dylan, the writer ] Some prominent writers celebrated Mr. Dylan’s literary achievements, including Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates and Salman Rushdie, who called Mr. Dylan “the brilliant inheritor of the bardic tradition,” adding, “Great choice. ” But others called the academy’s decision misguided and questioned whether songwriting, however brilliant, rises to the level of literature. “Bob Dylan winning a Nobel in Literature is like Mrs Fields being awarded 3 Michelin stars,” the novelist Rabih Alameddine wrote on Twitter. “This is almost as silly as Winston Churchill. ” Jodi Picoult, a   novelist, snarkily asked, “I’m happy for Bob Dylan, #ButDoesThisMeanICanWinAGrammy?” Many musicians praised the choice with a kind of awe. On Twitter, Rosanne Cash, the songwriter and daughter of Johnny Cash, wrote simply: “Holy mother of god. Bob Dylan wins the Nobel Prize. ” But some commentators bristled. Two   websites, Pitchfork and Vice, both ran columns questioning whether Mr. Dylan was an appropriate choice for the Nobel. As the writer of classic folk and protest songs like “Blowin’ in the Wind” and “The Times They Are  ’,” as well as Top 10 hits including “Like a Rolling Stone,” Mr. Dylan is an unusual Nobel winner. The first American to win the prize since Ms. Morrison in 1993, he is studied by Oxford dons and beloved by presidents. Yet instead of appearing at the standard staid news conference arranged by a publisher, Mr. Dylan was in Las Vegas on Thursday for a performance at a theater there. By late afternoon, Mr. Dylan had not commented on the honor. Mr. Dylan has often sprinkled literary allusions into his music and cited the influence of poetry on his lyrics, and has referenced Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Verlaine and Ezra Pound. He has also published poetry and prose, including his 1971 collection, “Tarantula,” and “Chronicles: Volume One,” a memoir published in 2004. His collected lyrics from   are due out on Nov. 1 from Simon  Schuster. Literary scholars have long debated whether Mr. Dylan’s lyrics can stand on their own as poetry, and an astonishing volume of academic work has been devoted to parsing his music. The Oxford Book of American Poetry included his song “Desolation Row,” in its 2006 edition, and Cambridge University Press released “The Cambridge Companion to Bob Dylan” in 2009, further cementing his reputation as a brilliant literary stylist. Billy Collins, the former United States poet laureate, argued that Mr. Dylan deserved to be recognized not merely as a songwriter, but as a poet. “Most song lyrics don’t really hold up without the music, and they aren’t supposed to,” Mr. Collins said in an interview. “Bob Dylan is in the 2 percent club of songwriters whose lyrics are interesting on the page even without the harmonica and the guitar and his very distinctive voice. I think he does qualify as poetry. ” In giving the literature prize to Mr. Dylan, the academy may also be recognizing that the gap has closed between high art and more commercial creative forms. “It’s literature, but it’s music, it’s performance, it’s art, it’s also highly commercial,” said David Hajdu, a music critic for The Nation who has written extensively about Mr. Dylan and his contemporaries. “The old categories of high and low art, they’ve been collapsing for a long time, but this is it being made official. ” In previous years, writers and publishers have grumbled that the prize often goes to obscure writers with clear political messages over more popular figures. But in choosing someone so well known, and so far outside of established literary traditions, the academy seems to have swung far into the other direction, bestowing prestige on a popular artist who already had plenty of it. It’s not the first time it has stretched the definition of literature. In 1953, Winston Churchill received the prize, in part as recognition of the literary qualities of his soaring political speeches and “brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values,” according to the academy. And many were surprised last year, when the prize went to the Belarussian journalist Svetlana Alexievich, whose deeply reported narratives draw on oral history. In its citation, the Swedish Academy credited Mr. Dylan with “having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition. ” Sara Danius, a literary scholar and the permanent secretary of the   academy, which called Mr. Dylan “a great poet in the   tradition” and compared him to Homer and Sappho, whose work was delivered orally. Asked if the decision to award the prize to a musician signaled a broadening in the definition of literature, Ms. Danius responded, “The times they are   perhaps. ” Mr. Dylan, whose original name is Robert Allen Zimmerman, was born on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minn. He emerged on the New York music scene in 1961 as an artist in the tradition of Woody Guthrie, singing protest songs and strumming an acoustic guitar in clubs and cafes in Greenwich Village. But from the start, Mr. Dylan stood out for dazzling lyrics and an oblique songwriting style that made him a source of fascination for artists and critics. In 1963, the folk group Peter, Paul and Mary reached No. 2 on the Billboard pop chart with a version of “Blowin’ in the Wind,” whose ambiguous refrains evoked Ecclesiastes. Within a few years, Mr. Dylan was confounding the very notion of folk music, with ever more complex songs and moves toward a more rock ’n’ roll sound. In 1965, he played with an electric rock band at the Newport Folk Festival, provoking a backlash from fans who accused him of selling out. After reports of a motorcycle accident in 1966 near his home in Woodstock, N. Y. Mr. Dylan withdrew further from public life but remained intensely fertile as a songwriter. His voluminous archives, showing his working process through thousands of pages of songwriting drafts, were acquired this year by institutions in Tulsa, Okla. His 1975 album “Blood on the Tracks” was interpreted as a supremely powerful account of the breakdown of a relationship, but just four years later the Christian themes of “Slow Train Coming” divided critics. His most recent two albums were chestnuts of traditional pop that had been associated with Frank Sinatra. Since 1988, Mr. Dylan has toured almost constantly, inspiring an unofficial name for his itinerary, the Never Ending Tour. Last weekend, he played the first of two performances at Desert Trip, a festival in Indio, Calif. that also featured the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney and other stars of the 1960s. He is scheduled to return on Friday for the festival’s second weekend. “As the ’60s wore on,” Giles Harvey wrote in The New York Review of Books in 2010, “Dylan grew increasingly frustrated with what he came to regard as the pious sloganeering and doctrinaire leftist politics of the folk milieu. ” He “began writing a kind of visionary nonsense verse, in which the rough, ribald, lawless America of the country’s traditional folk music collided with a surreal ensemble of characters from history, literature, legend, the Bible, and many other places besides. ” Mr. Dylan’s many albums, which the Swedish Academy described as having “a tremendous impact on popular music,” include “Bringing It All Back Home” and “Highway 61 Revisited” (1965) “Blonde on Blonde” (1966) “Blood on the Tracks” (1975) “Oh Mercy” (1989) “Time Out Of Mind” (1997) “‘Love and Theft’” (2001) and “Modern Times” (2006). His 38 studio albums have sold 125 million copies around the world. The academy added: “Dylan has the status of an icon. His influence on contemporary music is profound, and he is the object of a steady stream of secondary literature. ” Mr. Dylan’s many honors include Grammy, Academy and Golden Globe awards. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, won a special Pulitzer Prize in 2008 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. The Nobel comes with a prize of 8 million Swedish kronor, or just over $900, 000. The literature prize is given for a lifetime of writing rather than for a single work. “Today, everybody from Bruce Springsteen to U2 owes Bob a debt of gratitude,” President Obama said at the medal ceremony. “There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music. All these years later, he’s still chasing that sound, still searching for a little bit of truth. And I have to say that I am a really big fan. ” ■ Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese cell biologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Oct. 3 for his discoveries on how cells recycle their content, a process known as autophagy, a Greek term for “ . ” ■ David J.

20295,20295,That Old Phone Trump Uses for Twitter Could Be an Opening to Security Threats - The New York Times,Cecilia Kang,"President Trump has carried his Twitter habit into his presidency. He has also brought with him another tech habit that is causing concern. Mr. Trump has been using  his old, unsecured Android phone to post on Twitter since moving to Washington late last week. The president’s desire to use his old, personal smartphone raises concerns that its use could be exposing him and the nation to security threats. He is using the Android smartphone mainly to post on Twitter, not to make calls. But it’s unclear what security measures have been put in place on the device and how vulnerable he could be to someone stealing data or breaking into his Twitter account. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter requires a connection to the internet, which exposes the device to security vulnerabilities if proper measures like   authentication  —   a password and a code texted to a phone, for example  —   are not in place. If he uses the smartphone on an unsecure   network, he could be exposing his location and other personal information on the device. “The absolutely minimum Trump could do to protect our nation is to use a secure device to protect him from foreign spies and other threats,” said Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon on the Intelligence Committee. “It would be irresponsible in the extreme for the commander in chief to use an unsecure device that could be easily hacked or intercepted. ” Among the concerns by security experts: ■ It is unclear if the device and its functions like texting are encrypted to thwart hacking. ■ The device could be more vulnerable to hacking if used on unsecured   and cellular networks, such as when Mr. Trump travels between meetings or anywhere outside the White House. ■ Hackers could access the device to turn on the camera and microphone. ■ Stingray devices, a type of surveillance tool often used by law enforcement, can track a device’s location and other information. “There are a lot of questions, but it is clear there are often vulnerabilities in our phones and internet systems  —   and it is critical that people take precautions to ensure their sensitive information is protected from hackers and other malicious actors,” said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union. The president’s use of the personal device is particularly notable given his criticism of Hillary Clinton for using a personal email address and server when she was secretary of state. In 2009, President Barack Obama fought to become the first president with a smartphone though he won, the use of a White   secure device came with many rules. “As president, he is the biggest sitting target in the world,” said Kevin Bankston, the director of New America’s Open Technology Institute.",0

WASHINGTON D.C. ( INTELLIHUB ) — The Establishment elite are in panic mode after their rigged elections backfired in their face when vast seas of patriotic Americans took to the polls in favor of Donald J. Trump, giving America’s new President-elect the electoral votes needed to win. 
Last Thursday, during a meeting held at the White House, between Donald Trump and President Barack Obama, you could just see how irked Obama was knowing that he was sitting beside a truly patriotic soul; a man with a raging fire burning inside him; a man with the spirit to facilitate making America great again. Not to mention Trump was the man that brought Obama’s birth certificate issue to the forefront. The look on @POTUS face when he met @realDonaldTrump #priceless 
— Shepard Ambellas (@ShepardAmbellas) November 12, 2016 
In fact, during the meeting Obama was so threatened by Trump’s presence that his 8-year-long legacy likely flashed before his very eyes as the President of the United States realized that on day number one of Donald Trump’s presidency, a president Trump, at that point, could simply nullify any and all executive orders signed by the then would-be former president Barack Obama during his tenure as POTUS . What will happen if Trump nullifies all of Obama’s executive orders once POTUS? Ted Eytan/Flickr Does this mean no more ‘transgender bathrooms?’ 
Absolutely. Imagine that; a normal world, how it always was for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Naval History & Heritage Command/Flickr Does that mean Americans can keep their guns? 
Sure does. America would not be America if we did not have the right to bear arms and work to undo what anti-gunners have done in Washington D.C. over the past two decades and what Obama has done over the past 8-years against the U.S. Constitution . Fibonacci Blue/Flickr Does that mean the repeal of Obamacare or major failed portions of it? 
Yes it does. Does that mean the preservation of our civil rights and liberties per the Constitution? 
Sure does. Does that mean implementing a sensible immigration policy; possibly building a wall? 
Yes it does. After all, the Russians are now using advanced killer robots at their border, ones that can engage and kill humans from over 6 miles away. Nancy <I’m gonna SNAP!/Flickr Does that mean putting an end to dangerous geoengineering programs that our affecting all living things on the planet and our weather? 
One can only hope. 
But you can see where I am going with this. The Establishment elite simply do not want to lose their power and in my opinion will likely do anything to keep it. Remember, they have built a legacy and plan to protect it at all costs. 
So in other words; will Donald Trump actually take office against all odds?

They focus on analysis and intelligence of the ongoing crises and the biggest stories from around the world: Ukraine, the war in Middle East, Central Asia issues, protest movements in the Balkans, migration crises, and others. In addition, they provide military operations analysis, the military posture of major world powers, and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations. We try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media. Syrian War Report – November 4, 2016: Govt Forces Repel Fierce Militant Advance in Aleppo By South Front on November 4, 2016 …from SouthFront 
The Syrian army and the National Defense Forces (NDF) advanced along the Aleppo-Hama highway and seized the two hills – Tell Bazam and Tell Masin – north of the recently liberated town of Souran. Strategically, this offensive may allow the army and the NDF to flank the militant-controlled areas with the center in Latamanah. This strategy could lead to a success if the government forces are able to advance further to the north and to take control of Morek. 
The government forces continued military operations in Western Ghouta, targeting Jabhat Fatah al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian al-Qaeda branch) and its allies in the town of Khan al-Sheih. Earlier this week, the government forces made an attempt to make an agreement with the militants to allow them to withdraw from the city to the province of Idlib. However, this idea resulted in a falure and lead to further escalation in the area. Yesterday, the army and the NDF seized a key farms northeast of Khan al-Sheih and deployed in a striking distance from the militant stronghold. 
The army’s Tiger Forces, the Desert Hawks Brigade and Hezbollah successfully repelled a fiercest attack by the al-Nusra-led militant alliance, Jaish al-Fatah, in western Aleppo on November 3. Both sides suffered some casualties and Jaish al-Fatah used at least 2 car bombs in an attepmt to break the government forces’ defenses. Pro-militant sources report that the ‘opposition’ has destroyed some 4 units of military equipment belonging to the army. At least 1 infantry fighting vehicle and 1 battle tank belonging to Jaish al-Fatah were destroyed. On November 4, the humanitarian took place in the city. However, firefights are ongoing. 
The ISIS-linked media outlet Amaq released a footage of an explosion of Russian Mi-35 multi-role combat helicopter near the village of Huwaysis, northwest of Palmyra. the Mi-35 was delivering a humanitarian aid in the area when it was downed because of a technical failure. ISIS militants targeted the landing site with an anti-tank guided missile. The incident took place on November 3. The Mi-35’s crew (2 men) survived the incident and returned safely to the Russian Khmeimim Airbase in the province of Latakia. 
Russia’s state-of-the-art frigate Admiral Grigorovich, armed with Caliber missiles, set off to the Mediterranean Sea from the port of Sevastopol on November 3. The frigate will join the Russian naval task force off the coast of Syria.

20299,20299,"One in Every 137 Teenagers Would Identify as Transgender, Report Says - The New York Times",Niraj Chokshi,"Nearly 150, 000 American teenagers from 13 to 17 years old  —   or one out of every 137  —   would identify as transgender if survey takers asked, according to an analysis of state and federal data that offers an answer to a question that has long eluded researchers. The figure stands to inform the fierce debate over the rights of transgender youth, reignited on Wednesday by President Trump’s decision to rescind an Obama administration policy that protected the rights of students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity. The estimate may also help lawmakers and advocates across the country better understand the populations they serve. “We want to make sure that policy debates are informed by actual figures,” said Jody L. Herman, a scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute at the U. C. L. A. School of Law, where she and several   published the estimate in a report last month. That report, the latest in a series on transgender populations, included estimates of the transgender population in each state and in different age groups. In addition to an estimated 149, 750 transgender teenagers nationwide, accounting for 0. 7 percent of the population ages 13 to 17, Dr. Herman and her   estimated that there are 1. 4 million transgender adults in the United States. In the younger age group, transgender identification is probably more common among the older teenagers than the younger ones, they said. The Williams Institute, well regarded for its research on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, was frequently cited during the   marriage debate for its findings on the positive economic impact of allowing the practice. It also published a widely accepted estimate of the national L. G. B. T. population six years ago. In the January report, the researchers estimated that 22, 200 teenagers in California, 13, 800 in Texas and 9, 750 in New York would identify as transgender if asked. North Dakota and Wyoming were home to the smallest populations of transgender teenagers, estimated at just 200 each. Proportionally, however, Hawaii and West Virginia took the lead, with about 1 in 100 teenagers from 13 to 17 estimated to be transgender. In Connecticut and Iowa, the transgender share of that age group was projected to be much smaller, about 1 in 250. The analysis, an extrapolation based on adult responses to a federal survey, represents an indirect way of arriving at a figure that many advocates consider to be of crucial importance. ”It’s not about what your gut tells you, it’s not about what the news last night told you, it’s not about what you think you might have gathered from looking at a couple of internet websites,” said Kellan Baker, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress who specializes in L. G. B. T. and health issues. “It’s about what do the data actually say, so that we can target resources where they will do the most good. ” While the federal government collects a wide variety of detailed demographic information about the population, good, consistent data on sexual orientation and gender identity is lacking. “We just don’t have that same level of information readily accessible,” said Sandy James, survey project manager for the National Center for Transgender Equality. The Williams Institute estimates are based on a large Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey known as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. In addition to a core set of questions asked nationally, the C. D. C. allows states to choose from several optional questions to ask their residents. One such option, selected by about half the states in 2015 and slightly fewer in 2014, inquired about transgender identity. More than 150, 000 people answered the question each year. With that in hand, the researchers applied an advanced statistical technique regarded by some academics as an emerging gold standard for making state estimates using national data, based on   demographic and geographic patterns. The researchers extended the findings of the survey to all 50 states, after accounting for differences in race, age, education, income and religion. The C. D. C. surveys only adults, but the authors used trends among older age groups to estimate the number of teenagers who would identify as transgender if asked. There has been no authoritative,   questioning of teenagers about transgender identity. While the C. D. C. surveys children about gender identity, it asks only how they express gender in terms of masculinity and femininity, and the question is posed in a limited number of places, Dr. Herman said. Large, national surveys are also typically slow to change, in order to maintain consistent, comparable data over long periods of time. “This series of reports is our best attempt to use the best available data and the best methodology,” Dr. Herman said.",0
20300,20300,Kenya’s Collective ‘Uh-Oh’: Another Election Is Coming - The New York Times,Jeffrey Gettleman,"NAIROBI, Kenya  —   By 9 a. m. on Monday, clouds of black smoke blotted out the sky. A mountain of tires burned. Roads were blocked. Young men poured into the streets of a slum in Nairobi, gleefully carrying huge, jagged pieces of concrete. In Kisumu, a city on Lake Victoria, witnesses said police officers had fired on a crowd. A    boy was in critical condition after being shot in the back. A demonstrator was killed. For the past several weeks, Kenya’s opposition leaders have turned Mondays into protest days. Now they are threatening to hold demonstrations twice, and soon four times, a week. Many Kenyans are shaking their heads with a sense of fatigue and dread, saying, Here we go again. Kenya is a relatively prosperous, developed and politically tolerant African nation. But elections have not been its strong suit. In the past 25 years, almost every presidential race has been marred by violence the worst one was in   when ethnic rivalries cracked open and more than 1, 000 people were killed, many in deadly protests. Kenya spent years trying to heal its wounds and recover from the devastation, culminating in a tense but more peaceful election in 2013. Despite widespread distrust of the results, the country held together, helping it recapture its image as a bastion of stability in the region. Now, with another election scheduled for next year and the opposition already mobilizing thousands of people, many Kenyans are worried about recent economic gains’ being reduced to char blowing in the wind. “It’s getting very nervy,” said   Satchu, an investment adviser in Nairobi. “The economy crashes and burns when we fumble these elections. What’s worrying is that this is happening so early, that we already have this degree of contestation. ” Each Monday, now known as Tear Gas Monday, many businesses close. Parents do not send their children to school. Motorists stay off the streets, afraid of rocks being thrown through their windshields. The opposition leaders are aware of this part of their leverage is the ability to slow down the economy. A watchman in Nairobi spoke of his “inside fear” of even coming to town on Mondays. The opposition’s rallying point has become Kenya’s election commission. Raila Odinga, a former prime minister who has been angling for president for much of the past two decades, has demanded that the government disband the commission, which is widely viewed as biased and corrupt. A British court recently convicted two British businessmen of bribing Kenyan election commissioners to get contracts for printing ballots. But in Kenya, those same commissioners have not even been charged. This is another problem in Kenya. Almost all corruption cases against powerful people languish for months. Then they quietly disappear. “The government needs to throw out that commission,” said Paul Shida, a welder in the Kibera slums in Nairobi, where the protests began Monday. “Street protest is the only language the government understands. ” The election commission controversy has progressed from an annoyance to a major crisis for Kenya’s president, Uhuru Kenyatta. He is not believed to be especially close to any of the election commissioners, but they were the same ones who validated his victory in 2013 amid allegations of rigging. He has refused to disband the commission, and his security services have threatened to crack down on protesters. But as the protests grind on, a    game is being played between Mr. Kenyatta’s government and Kenya’s judiciary, which many Kenyans regard as independent. Last week, police officials banned an opposition rally in the city’s historic Uhuru Park a court promptly overturned that ban. This weekend, police officials declared again that it was illegal for the opposition to protest and warned that they were ready to use lethal force. They did so in Kisumu on Monday. Witnesses said the police fired indiscriminately at a crowd, hitting the    boy and leaving him in critical condition, and killing a   protester. Also on Monday, a court ruled that the opposition had a right to protest and that the police had a duty to protect demonstrators. Though the violence in the past few weeks has been nothing compared with the paroxysm of bloodshed that swept the country in 2007 and 2008, the dynamics are similar. The nation, and especially its economy, are being held hostage by the relationship between Mr. Kenyatta and Mr. Odinga, who will most likely face off in the election next year. Last week, tensions suddenly lifted after the two met and a picture of them walking together, smiling, appeared on the front pages of the leading newspapers. But the two were soon at loggerheads again, and the protests were back on. Mr. Satchu estimated that at least $5 million was lost every Monday because of interruptions, closed businesses, property destruction and petty crime. On Monday afternoon, Bharat Shah, who runs a Nairobi curio shop, held up a pad of paper with the number 360 scribbled on it, for 360 shillings, less than $4. “That’s what I’ve sold today,” he said with a wry laugh. “One packet of beads. ” Just as in   business leaders have been discreetly meeting with government and opposition leaders, urging them to compromise, for the sake of the economy. “Among international investors, there remains a strong commitment to Kenya as a gateway to this region, and that hasn’t been shaken yet,” Mr. Satchu said. “But surely it will be shaken if this malarkey continues. ”",0
20301,20301,Berkeley College Republicans Call Bullsh*t on Free Speech Celebrations,Quest,"We Are Change 
On the 50th anniversary of the Free Speech Movement, its hypocrisy is exposed 
November 2013 : Berkeley student government unanimously passes a bill to ban the term “illegal alien” from campus discourse.
September 2013 : After several Mexican-American members of the campus fraternity Delta Chi suggest hosting a quinceanera-themed party, the student government condemns the frat for “appropriating the culture” of Mexican-Americans.
December 2012 : Citing their “disapproval” of the viewpoints espoused by the second largest charity in the Unites States, the Berkeley student government passes a bill to boot Salvation Army donation boxes from campus, arguing the charity’s presence on campus creates a hostile and uncomfortable environment. 
September 2011 : Berkeley’s student government unanimously passes a bill condemning disrespectful speech.
And on Friday, as UC Berkeley students and faculty wrapped up a week-long celebration to mark the 50th anniversary of its Free Speech Movement, the UC Berkeley College Republicans illustrated to our peers how the university has actually turned its back on the First Amendment.
To that end, club members stood in front of Sproul Hall holding a large banner that read “Free Speech [does not equal] Comfortable Speech” – and it got students’ attention, as the positive platitudes they’d heard all week about the movement were vehemently challenged.
According to the Berkeley College Republicans, the true essence of the Free Speech Movement has been lost in recent decades. The ideals of the movement have been discarded, replaced with notions such as tolerance and civility.
In the 1960s, students broke out from within the constraints of the status quo. They said the things parents and professors and peers were telling them not to. Today, and especially on the Berkeley campus, conservative students are the ones taking a stand, and yet we’re maligned and ostracized for it.
In the aftermath of the Berkeley College Republicans’ 2011 “Diversity Bake Sale,” the student government attempted to have the club de-funded due to the argument that the speech the club engaged in was disrespectful and uncomfortable.
Free speech, huh?
Our display on Friday intended to bring to light the many breaches of free speech that have taken place on campus, sponsored by organizations such as the student-body government at UC Berkeley.
Alongside the banner, club members passed out fliers containing a list of incidents in which campus leaders limited various students’ right to exercise their personal liberties.
The flier also attacked the campus for its recent movement to discontinue the exchange of academe between the UC system and Israeli universities, another example of UC Berkeley silencing any communication and discourse that may offend or upset some individuals.
There is a strange perversion of free speech taking place on this campus. It’s perfectly acceptable to occupy campus buildings and create pinatas out of the UC president’s image, but that’s only because the individuals in question fall under one school of thought. As soon as someone different comes along, and stirs the pot, they’re pointedly silenced.
Throughout the day, our club passed out hundreds of fliers and displayed our sign from the morning until late into the afternoon. Students came up and asked questions, and many seemed interested in the cause. Others were shocked to learn about the many times their campus – the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement – had overtly suppressed open dialogue.
“The people I talked to seemed to agree with the point our message was trying to get across,” said Edward Saenz, a member of the Berkeley College Republicans. “No one I talked to believed that free speech should have stipulations tied to it.”

Student protesters at the University of California-Berkeley gathered in front of a bridge on campus and forcibly prevented white people from crossing it. Students of color were allowed to pass. 
The massive human wall was conceived as a pro-safe space demonstration. Activists wanted the university administration to designate additional safe spaces for trans students, gay students, and students of color. They were apparently incensed that one of their official safe spaces had been moved from the fifth floor of a building to the basement. 
According to video footage of the protest, demonstrators blocked off the bridge completely. Students who needed to get to class had no choice but to cross the stream by jumping from rock to rock. Dozens of people can be seen doing so.

20302,20302,Woman 'eaten alive' by daughter's dogs,-NO AUTHOR-,"Woman 'eaten alive' by daughter's dogs 2 German shepherds reportedly responsible for mauling death Published: 13 mins ago 
(FOX5NY) — NEW YORK (INSIDE EDITION) – A 68-year-old woman was found dead in the basement of her New York home by her devastated daughter, who told authorities her dogs may have eaten her mother, a police source told Inside Edition. 
Officers responding to a 911 call for an unconscious and unresponsive woman found the body of Daisie Bradshaw in her Staten Island home at about 9:40 a.m. Tuesday, the NYPD said. 
The victim, who was found beaten and bruised, was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said.",1
20303,20303,Train Crash in Italy Leaves at Least 25 Dead and Dozens Injured - The New York Times,Gaia Pianigiani,"ROME  —   Two passenger trains collided   in the Puglia region of southern Italy on Tuesday morning, killing at least 25 people and injuring dozens more, some of them critically. The crash occurred around 11:30 a. m. on a single track running through an olive grove between the towns of Andria and Ruvo di Puglia. The closest major city is Bari, about 20 miles east of Ruvo di Puglia. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who was attending the opening of a new science museum in Milan, announced that he would return immediately to Rome and ordered an investigation. He later visited the site of the crash, the news agency ANSA reported. “We won’t stop until we clarify what happened,” he told reporters in Milan. “There is an absolute need to understand who is responsible and to shed total light” on what happened, he said. Mr. Renzi sent the infrastructure and transportation minister, Graziano Delrio, and the head of the civil protection agency, Fabrizio Curcio, who oversees emergency response in Italy, to the site of the crash. “It’s an incident of enormous proportions,” Mr. Delrio said when he reached the scene on Tuesday afternoon, adding that the crash was “very violent. ” The circumstances that led to the collision were unclear. A team of inspectors from the transportation ministry will work with local prosecutors to determine the cause, officials said. Teams of rescuers worked through the afternoon to separate the two trains, extricating victims and searching for survivors in the intense July heat. One exhausted policeman, who appeared barely able to walk, was escorted from the scene by another officer. “It’s so horrible,” a woman who survived the crash told a local television channel, Telesveva, in an interview. “I don’t know how it happened, but in a second, my husband was suddenly two meters away from me. ” The woman, whom Telesveva did not identify, described seeing body parts strewn on the ground, and said she had had to step over them barefoot to get away from the crash after pulling her husband free of the wreckage. “I could do nothing for them,” she said. The front cars of both trains were smashed, and both trains were at least partly derailed. Television images showed heavily damaged rail cars. At least one car was still on the tracks with its windows blown out another was laying off to the side, twisted at an odd angle with its undercarriage facing upward. News agencies also broadcast images of rescue officials taking away wounded passengers on stretchers. The jarring sound of cicadas could be heard as firefighters searched for survivors among the wreckage. ANSA reported that emergency workers had extracted a young boy from the wreckage and taken him by helicopter to a hospital. With no access roads near the tracks, it was difficult for    teams to get vehicles through the olive grove to the crash site. Local officials made an appeal for blood donations, and put the number of injured at 55, most in critical or serious condition. Stefania Gnesi, an information technology staff researcher at the National Research Council, said in a telephone interview that there was no automatic brake system in use on the stretch of track where the crash occurred. Ms. Gnesi said that the trains were probably operating on instructions from dispatchers. “It’s probable that there was some human error in this chain, in a section of train track that has no automatic control or automatic brake system,” she said. Automatic systems are used on most of Italy’s railway lines, but have not yet been installed in some areas, especially in southern Italy, which is less developed and less prosperous than the north. The line where the crash occurred links the cities of Andria and Bari on the Adriatic coast, and is used by about 10, 000 passengers a day, according to Riccardo Amirante, a deputy dean at Politecnico University in Bari. There are two tracks along most of the   line, Mr. Amirante said in a phone interview, “but unfortunately not that stretch. ” He said trains typically travel the line at around 90 kilometers an hour, or 56 m. p. h. The accident appeared to be one of the most deadly rail disasters in Italy in seven years. In June 2009, a   freight train carrying liquefied petroleum gas derailed and exploded in Viareggio, on the west coast of Italy in the Tuscany region. That disaster killed 32 people. President Sergio Mattarella of Italy expressed “deep pain” over the crash, which he called an “unacceptable tragedy. ” Mr. Mattarella said in a statement: “We need to ascertain immediately and precisely responsibilities and possible flaws. ”",0
20304,20304,Selected Not Elected: The Election Has Been Stolen,Dave Hodges,"Selected Not Elected: The Election Has Been Stolen 
As it stands now, the election has been stolen by George Soros and Hillary Clinton. 
Examples of voter fraud are pouring in from across the country. George Soros and Hillary Clinton have made a mockery of our election. America is quickly descending into Stalin’s Russia. The great democratic experiment is over and our overlords (i.e. George Soros) rule America from behind the scenes. If Clinton becomes president, Soros will be the de facto president. 
In the furtherance of this goal, voter fraud is rampant. Here is what is taking place in my home county. It is representative of what is happening across the country. 
On Saturday, I am interviewing a Texas elector, Ken Clark, from the electoral college. He told me that when Bush was opposed by Gore, that he received enormous pressure to change his vote in the days leading up to the electors vote including being contacted at his hotel prior to the vote. This is already happening with some of the Arizona electors. It is going to happen all across the country. Massive Voter Fraud in Arizona As I have reported, and it bears repeating, a very reliable political source in Arizona has reported to me that an elector has been offered an inducement (bribe) to vote for Clinton instead of Trump. Details are still emerging and I expect to get more in the immediate few days following the election. I can say now, that the inducements included payment to a phony shell corporation in an off shore account. It should also be noted that Arizona is on the list of 16 states to be using George Soros’ voting machines. The following is an example of this impropriety at work. I received this communication last week from a relative of an employee of the Maricopa County Clerk’s office that is in charge of local elections in the Phoenix area. Dear Dave, I have a relative who works in elections for the county. What they have told me is scary beyond belief. During the primary election as you will remember, people lined up for hours to vote because our illustrious leader Helen Purcell purposely limited the amount of voting locations. My relative was a witness to the manner in which early ballots were transferred for counting. They saw an individual by themself transfer the votes. The ballots were in a cardboard box and were open? Anyone could tamper with the vote. I am telling that the same thing is going on again right here in Maricopa County. This practice which is illegal will allow the Clinton to commit massive voter fraud against Donald Trump. Some of the new voting machines have been tested and they revert to a vote for Clinton when a Republic straight line ticket is entered. Ballots that were mixed between the parties but had Trump as the choice were tagged as unreadable and if the test was real, would have been thrown out based on user error. The top people here know what is going on and they are not reporting this as of October 17, 2016. At County elections there is a very intimidating feel. Everyone is afraid to speak out. And I almost forgot that Sheriff Joe’s trial run showed the same pattern as Trump. They want him out too. Well this unbelievable account got attention from Phoenix TV station, News Channel 3. On October 26, at 605 AM, the station ran a very close version of the story described above. I was stunned as I saw the report parallel the email I received (above). However, at the end of the report, they let a Democratic Party Official, who looked like a heroin addict claim that similar problems with the voting machines were also found for Hillary Clinton. Yet, not one example was offered of this Democratic claim on the TV report, just her word in an example of very shoddy journalism. Speaking of the massive fraud going on in Maricopa County, I want to reiterate what I reported on 10/26/2016. A postal employee told me that they had already processed 2.7 million votes from early balloting. There are only 3.4 million registered voters in all of Arizona. Are we supposed to believe that 80% of Arizona’s residents are voting? Are supposed to believe that this unbelievably high percentage of Arizona voters are voting by mail in ballot? These numbers defy logic. This is a clear case of ballot stuffing. Should we be surprised by the events in Arizona? The head of Maricopa County elections, Helen Purcell, oversaw a voting fiasco in the last election,the Republican primary election. Yet, she was re-elected by the must suspicious and narrowest of margins. Also in Maricopa County, County DA, Bill Montgomery has filed an election tampering charges against George Soros for his personal donation of millions of dollars that were used to support Democratic prosecutors. In other words, when the voter fraud is unveiled and exposed for all to see, Soros will see that nobody gets prosecuted for the bad acts being committed by the Democrats in the same manner in which Comey and Lynch let Hillary Clinton avoid the per walk. The Purpose of the Polls The polls conducted by mainstream media outlets are shoddy and the include small sample sizes and a disproportionate number of Democrats that are surveyed. The purpose is to create the perception that Trump cannot win and when the voter fraud kicks in, as it is now, nobody will question the fraud because they have been falsely conditioned that Trump will lose. Further, the polls are designed to discourage Trump supporters from voting and since their man cannot win, why not just stay home and have a beer? Here is a summary of a recent independent poll in which Trump was found to be leading 67%-19% over Clinton. 
When the fraud is cover and Clinton has won, Americans will have to make a choice on how to respond. PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL AND DON’T FORGET TO “LIKE” US

20305,20305,"Obama Climate Plan, Now in Court, May Hinge on Error in 1990 Law - The New York Times",Coral Davenport,"WASHINGTON  —   The pitched battle over President Obama’s signature climate change policy, which is moving to the courts this week, carries considerable political, economic and historical stakes. Yet its legal fate, widely expected to be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, could rest on a clerical error in an obscure provision of a    law. That error, which left conflicting amendments on power plant regulation in the Clean Air Act, will be a major focus of oral arguments by opponents of Mr. Obama’s initiative when the case is heard on Tuesday in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The initiative, known as the Clean Power Plan, which Mr. Obama sees as at the heart of his climate change legacy, gave the United States critical leverage to broker the landmark 2015 Paris climate change accord. If the plan is struck down, the United States, the world’s largest carbon polluter over the centuries, will lose its main tool to cut greenhouse gas emissions. If it is upheld, it will transform the nation’s electricity system, closing hundreds of   power plants and setting in motion a wholesale shift to wind, solar and nuclear power, as well as to improved electric transmission systems.   states and more than 100 companies and labor and industry groups are fighting to overturn the plan. Defending it are 18 states and dozens of environmental and public health groups that have joined forces with the Obama administration. Nearly 20 lawyers will take turns arguing the case before 10 judges  —   much larger than the typical   panel. The judges have allocated four hours to hear the arguments, rather than the usual one or two. The chief judge of the court, Merrick B. Garland, who is also Mr. Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, has recused himself. Adding to the drama will be the presence of Mr. Obama’s mentor at Harvard Law School, Laurence H. Tribe, who will argue against the climate plan on behalf of the nation’s largest coal company, Peabody Energy. The   clerical error at issue in the case  —   State of West Virginia, et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency  —   involves an update to the Clean Air Act passed by Congress in 1990. The Clean Air Act of 1970 is the legal foundation of the Clean Power Plan. An obscure provision in the law  —   Section 111( d)  —   gave the E. P. A. broad authority to regulate unknown future pollutants. At the time, carbon dioxide, the nontoxic but   gas that is the chief cause of global warming, was not considered a pollutant. In 1990, when Congress passed the update to the Clean Air Act, it amended Section 111( d). A version of the amendment passed by the House said that if the E. P. A. was already regulating power plant pollution under a separate section of the law, it could not use Section 111( d) to create new regulations on the same plants. A version of the amendment passed by the Senate, however, did allow such overlapping regulation. When the two bills were merged, lawmakers forgot to strike out one of the conflicting amendments in the   rush to push the bill through. So it was signed into law by President George Bush with both amendments. Opponents of the Clean Power Plan will argue on Tuesday that a strict interpretation of the House amendment would render the plan illegal. Last year, when the E. P. A. issued the Clean Power Plan, it used Section 111( d) to justify placing new regulations on carbon dioxide emissions from   power plants. The agency has also long regulated toxic power plant pollutants, such as mercury, under a different section, 112, of the Clean Air Act. “In 1990, Congress dramatically expanded the Clean Air Act, and when they did that, they said an industry cannot be ” said Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer representing many of the groups suing the administration. Sean Donahue, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund who will argue this portion of the case before the court, called that legal interpretation “preposterous. ” “It’s very interesting that there was this legislative glitch,” he said. Environmentalists and the administration will argue that because the two types of pollutants are so different, the E. P. A. is justified in using two sections of the law to regulate them. “This bizarre proposition is like exempting restaurants from food handling requirements because they are subject to the fire code,” Mr. Donahue said. Opponents of the plan will also focus on two other main points, arguing that Mr. Obama has exceeded his executive authority. While environmental regulations under the Clean Air Act often require states to cut pollution by using specific technology, such as affixing “scrubbers” to smokestacks, the Clean Power Plan goes further: It asks states to reduce pollution by making changes to their entire electricity systems  —   shutting down coal plants, and building wind and solar plants. The plan also encourages states to reduce emissions by putting in place “  ” systems, which would create state or regional caps on emissions and allow companies to buy and sell credits to pollute. In his first term, Mr. Obama tried but failed to push a    bill through Congress. Now, his opponents say, he is using regulation to force the system through. “The E. P. A. is going beyond what it’s authorized to do by Congress and essentially creating new law,” said Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, a leader in coordinating the legal opposition to the plan. David Doniger, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which worked closely with the Obama administration to draft the plan, dismissed that objection, noting that the E. P. A. already uses a    system to regulate other sources of pollution. Given the high stakes, the two sides have gone to unusual lengths in their preparation, including what longtime activists say is an unprecedented level of counterintelligence work. Consultants have been gathering   details about how their opponents are organizing their side of the fight, in an attempt to find embarrassing tidbits that might undermine their arguments, at least in the public’s eye. Both sides have spent months filing Freedom of Information requests and related lawsuits to obtain email correspondence and other records from their opponents. Environmental groups sought emails between the state attorneys general who are challenging the Clean Power Plan and executives from the coal and electric utility industries. Lawyers and consultants paid by the energy industry have sought records showing that environmentalists have worked closely with liberal politicians who support the plan. “Transparency is a good thing, so having more of these documents serves the public,” said Kert Davies, the executive director of a group called the Climate Investigations Center, which has helped gather counterintelligence information on opponents of the Clean Power Plan. “But it is certainly an escalating war, back and forth. The intensity has peaked. ”",0
20306,20306,Trump Accuses Clinton of Guiding Global Elite Against U.S. Working Class - The New York Times,Niraj Chokshi,"Donald J. Trump on Thursday accused Hillary Clinton of guiding a “global power structure” that has rigged the economy against the working class, language that some suggested echoed   themes. Mr. Trump made the accusation in a speech in West Palm Beach, Fla. in which he also defended himself against several accusations of sexual harassment, published by The New York Times and others. Early in the speech, he said that a global elite had “stripped” the United States of its wealth in order to line the pockets of corporate and political interests. “The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure,” he said. “We’ve seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U. S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors,” he said, referring to the group that has, most recently, published thousands of hacked emails from Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman. The remarks drew criticism from some who said they resembled prejudicial language used by  . “Whether intentionally or not, Donald Trump is evoking classic   themes that have historically been used against Jews and still reverberate today,” Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the   League, a group that fights discrimination, said in a statement. Mr. Greenblatt said the group feared that white supremacists might see the comments as tacit encouragement. “Mr. Trump focused on the very issues and themes that obsess conspiratorial  : They believe that there is an elite group of Jews who control the media, the government, and banking, and who are trying to destroy white America,” he said. “They also believe that most of Hillary Clinton’s donors are Jewish. ” The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Others drew a more direct comparison between Mr. Trump’s words and those of  . In the speech, Mr. Trump also accused the “Clinton machine” of wielding control over the news media, as well. “The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, the press,” he said to jeers from the audience. While the allegations were aimed at Mrs. Clinton, who is a Methodist, Jews have long been accused of conspiring to control institutions like banks and the media in order to amass wealth and power. In 1931, for example, the author A. N. Field described the creation of the American Federal Reserve as the moment the “  engine of control” enslaved the United States, according to the   League. That conspiracy theory has survived the ensuing decades and, even today, such   beliefs remain prevalent around the world, according to A. D. L. polling.

20307,20307,Russia or the Neocons: Who endangers American democracy? | OffGuardian,nan,"by Vladimir Golstein, via The Duran 
Political discourse of American mass media is inundated with another wave of Russophobia and fear mongering. Besides the obvious military threat (Russia’s nuclear arsenal), or the challenges to the US foreign policy (the conflicts in Ukraine or Syria), a new fear has been introduced into the news: the US political system is endangered by Russia’s computer hacking, informational warfare, and its support of Donald Trump. 
The newspaper titles sound like a commercial for the upcoming Invasion of the Body Snatchers sequel. The Washingon Post announces: “Russia Is Now a Threat. The US Should Treat It Like One.” Time magazine raises the stakes: “Russia Wants to Undermine Faith in the U.S. Election.” 
The Atlantic warns of the “The Dangers of the Putin-Trump relationship,” articulating the already familiar litany of complaints: “Russia is directly interfering in the US elections … it is a dangerous escalation that threatens the integrity of the US electoral process.” While US Today allows notorious neocon named Max Boot to discover not just the threat, but an actual war. His “Time to Get Real About Russia Cyber War,” is rather blunt: “Our democracy is under attack by Russia, but almost no one is treating the situation with the gravity it deserves.” 
Well, nobody treats the situation with the gravity it deserves because they are treating it with much greater gravity. In fact, some of the commentators are so grave, that they are ready to give in already. Zack Beauchamp concludes his tirades against Russian hacking in the following manner: “Russia’s strategy is even more dangerous that it appears. Not only does it undermine democracy using the press but it actually gets the press to undermine itself. And there’s not much we can reasonably do about it, either.” 
Reading all this, one might think that the former Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal , has been resurrected along with his 1949 battle-cry: “The Russians are coming. The Russians are coming. They’re right around. I’ve seen Russian soldiers.” 
What is behind this Russophobia? A real Russian threat? A smokescreen intended to cover failed policies of recent administration? The meeting between the Russophobic minds of a particular candidate (Hillary Clinton) and a particular group of voters (neocons)? 
I believe that these Joe McCarthy type accusations against both Russia and Trump seem to pursue only one goal: to give the veneer of respectability to the neocons’ and other Republican luminaries’ desertion of their own party. Thus, endless “confessions” of reformed Republicans and hardcore neocons , expressing their born-again zeal for the Democratic Candidate, Hillary Clinton. 
The neocons are not switching parties because they’ve seen the light. They are enamored with Hillary Clinton’s record of foreign policy and her willingness to embrace the US globalist claims. As reported by Rania Khalek in Intercept , Robert Kagan, one of the leading neocons, the co-founder of the notorious PNAC (Project for the New American Century, the blueprint of the recent policies of aggression and regime change intended to cement US hegemony in world affairs), has been on the record for quite some time: “I would say all Republican foreign policy professionals are anti-Trump,” Kagan told …at a “ foreign policy professionals for Hillary ” fundraiser… –I would say that a majority of people in my circle will vote for Hillary.” 
The neocons are very public about their desertion, and bear it as a badge of honor. Dubious honor, since in their pursuit of an ideal candidate for their agenda, neocons do not just betray their former party, but the very foundations of American democracy: the two party system. 
Their desertion reveals that American political system has finally internalized Francis Fukuyama proud words about the end of history. We’ve reached the consensus; there is no need to argue or challenge, history has ended, the truths are revealed and they are now the property of the elites united into one globalist Imperial party bent on equating American prosperity with the American hegemony over world affairs. 
To any objective observer it is clear that is not Russia that endangers US democracy but the political corruption, the rule of 1% oligarchy, and mad pursuit of PNAC policies. Even greater danger to democracy lies in the neocons’ desertion to the Hillary camp. 
Unsavory as the corporate rule and globalism might be, one can argue for and pursue these goals, provided they leave the room for the alternative vision. It is this neocons’ dismissal of the alternatives that betrays the very foundations of democracy, at least, in the way, a political philosopher Karl Popper formulated them in his celebrated 1945 treatise, Open Society and Its Enemies . 
The list of neocons and other prominent Republicans rushing toward one party system has been compiled by Eleanor Clift in Daily Beast at the end of June, and had obviously grown since then. Some of them, Max Boot in particular, are pretty explicit about the reasons for his desertion: in his May 8, 2016, article in LA Times , Boot announces simply that, “The Republican Party is Dead.” 
Why? Because it is no longer led by the likes of McCain, Rubio and Romney, for whom Boot served as foreign policy advisor, but by Donald Trump, “the ignorant demagogue” intending to break up “the most successful alliance in history — NATO.” Furthermore, Trump has “kind words for tyrants such as Vladimir Putin.” Indeed, how can anyone in the US political establishment have kind words for Putin? We keep our kind words only for “our SOBs.” 
The simplicity if not poverty of this argumentation makes it difficult to distinguish it from exaggerations, simplification, or ignorance, for which neocons consistently fault Trump. But neocons were never friends of irony; otherwise, they would not make statements about NATO’s spectacular success with a straight face. 
The alliance that followed every whim of its paranoid members, such as Baltic Republics or Poland, and which intended to drag Ukraine into NATO pushing the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation? If this is success, how does one define failure? And talking about exaggerations: “The risk of Trump winning, however remote, represents the biggest national security threat that the United States faces today.” 
As if being “dead” is not bad enough, Boot feels the need to drive a stake into the heart of the Republican Party: the party is stupid . Writing for NYT , the publication that never misses a chance to print something nasty about Republicans, Boot bemoans Republican complicity with Donald Trump phenomenon: “How the Stupid Party’ Created Donald Trump.” 
Why can’t there be an alternative to the neocons’ doctrines of world domination in the form of a populist, nationalist movement that wants Americans to take care of Americans first, before overextending the country’s economic and military reach? And should this alternative be immediately called stupid? 
Yet, for many neocons, it is Hillary or bust. James Kirchik goes out of his way trying to convince his fellow conservatives that it is Clinton who is a true conservative, and therefore, the last American hope: “It’s come to this: Hillary Clinton is the one person standing between America and the abyss.” 
Referring to a profound conservative thinker, Michael Oakeshott, Kirchik observed that Oakeshott “defines the conservative disposition as one that ‘prefers small and limited innovations to large and indefinite’ ones and ‘favors a slow rather than a rapid pace, and pauses to observe current consequences and make appropriate adjustments.’ … Clinton is the candidate of the status quo, something that conservatives, by definition, are supposed to uphold.” 
Kirchick fails to mention, however, that it is Clintons’ and Obama’s implementation of neocons’ policies which is nothing short of revolutionary. Military adventures, drastic regime changes, alliance redrawing, the willingness to sacrifice American lives and money in their pursuit, all these misguided policies that meet no political resistance –that’s what revolutionary. 
Trump’s realism and pragmatic approach to politics appears as revolutionary only to the ideologues who refuse to pause in their drive to reshape the modern world according to their childish dreams. 
This radical reworking of democratic and conservative process of slow incremental improvements into the hegemony of corporate sponsored elites is indeed revolutionary: a modern day version of Lenin’s hegemony of proletariat and its avant-garde, the elite party, all over again. 
Hillary Clinton is as conservative as Brezhnev, who, in his failure to modify or change the radical agenda set up by the party of Lenin and Stalin, was indeed, a conservative. Only an intellectual of Kirchick’s magnitude can see something Oakeshottian in this embrace of one party system. 
As someone who lived under one party rule in the former Soviet Union, I fully appreciate Popper’s rather minimalistic, but fundamental view of democracy, as the society that boasts a two party system and which guarantees the ease of deposing a ruling party in case of its failures. 
Karl Popper insisted on the necessity and practical usefulness of the two-party system, so that the loss of power would lead to self-scrutiny and therefore improvement. While the two parties and their loyal press try to police each other, they keep each other busy, allowing the rest of the citizens to live in peace and pursue their goals without too much interference or control. 
Obviously, all this goes down the drain with the one party system of globalists and the elites, the party that mocks and dismisses as ridiculous or deplorable anyone who happens to challenge it. 
In his The Open Society and its Enemies Popper proposes a rather paradoxical, yet extremely sensible theory of a democratic society. What is important for Popper, is not the discovery of a perfect government, but a much more mundane and pragmatic question: how to avoid the blatantly bad ones. And democracy does it better than any other system. Insisting on this pragmatism, Popper highlights the following syllogism: 
And we do not base our choice on the goodness of democracy, which may be doubtful, but solely on the evilness of a dictatorship, which is certain. Not only because the dictator is bound to make bad use of his power, but because a dictator, even if he were benevolent, would rob all others of their responsibility, and thus of their human rights and duties. This is a sufficient basis for deciding in favor of democracy—that is, a rule of law that enables us to get rid of the government. No majority, however large, ought to be qualified to abandon this rule of law.” 
Popper wrote this elucidation for The Economist ; where he explains his paradoxical thought in the following manner: 
In ‘The Open Society and its Enemies’ I suggested that an entirely new problem should be recognized as the fundamental problem of a rational political theory… how can we best avoid situations in which a bad ruler causes too much harm? 
When we say that the best solution known to us is a constitution that allows a majority vote to dismiss the government, then we do not say the majority vote will always be right. We do not even say that it will usually be right.” 
For Popper, the two-party system is a requirement not because any of these parties possesses the truth, but because they can lose, be removed from power, and thus given a chance to think things through and improve. Consequently, it is the very possibility of losing, and therefore improving, that makes democracies dynamic and progressive: 
From the point of view of the new theory, Election day ought to be a Day of Judgment. As Pericles of Athens said in about 430 BC, ‘although only a few may originate a policy, we are all able to judge it.’ Of course, we may misjudge it; in fact, we often do. But if we have lived through a party’s period of power and have felt its repercussions, we have at least some qualifications for judgment…In order to make a majority government probable, we need something approaching a two-party system…. for such a system encourages a continual process of self-criticism by the two parties.” 
For Popper, the two –party system is preferable since “an inclination to self-criticism after an electoral defeat is far more pronounced in countries with a two-party system than in those where there are several parties.” It is this self-criticism of a losing party; this desire to reform and modernize that provides healthy development for democracies. 
The rule of the last two decades did not improve the economic life of the majority of Americans; in fact, it resulted in the drastic redistribution of wealth. It didn’t bring peace to the world stage. In fact, we are standing on the threshold of nuclear confrontation. 
Yet, in the manner of the Germany in 1930s, we are rapidly overstepping democratic principles for the sake of one party and its global ambitions, of the consensus formulated by the PNAC, Council of Foreign Affairs, Atlantic Council, and other think tanks, along with the State Department, and the press, all of whom argue for the same policies all over again. Even now, weeks before the elections, we are reading about the same bureaucrats in Pentagon, CIA, or State Department, haggling for the place in the future Hillary cabinet. 
It is those rascals that can be sent home, who are worthy of being voted in. And conversely, it is those rascals, who want to stay in power no matter how wrongheaded, dangerous, or unpopular their policies are that should be thrown out. 
There is no absolute truth in politics, there is no end of history, and there is no one size fits all. Popper understood it much better than Fukuyama. History never ends: parties should continue to lose, and thus given a chance to come up with better policies for the next election. Only when Democratic Party is forced to take a back seat, it will contemplate on how it can improve, and offer new policies for the country. 
Propping up Hillary as the best embodiment of the failed policies, allowing the same bankers, diplomats, and generals to metastasize into next election and hold the same key positions in the Pentagon, the State Department, CIA or Treasury, is ultimately, the embrace of one party system; it provides a profound disservice to the United States and its democratic tradition. 
At the last presidential debate this electoral season, Hillary Clinton pretended to be appalled by Trump’s hypothetical refusal to accept the results of the November elections. Mass media echo chambers went into the override mode bemoaning Trump’s disrespect for the venerable political tradition of peaceful transition of power. Trump was never in power, however. 
What is truly appalling is the real, not the hypothetical threat of turning US into a one party system, the system which is so entrenched that it can only mock, dismiss, and conspire to denigrate its opponents. Maybe Mr. Forrestal was right after all. Russians, or rather Soviets, are here, but they do not hack the emails, they write them. Rate this: ",1
20308,20308,Iran to Bar American Wrestling Team From World Cup - The New York Times,Victor Mather,"Iran will bar the United States wrestling team from a major international meet this month in response to President Trump’s order severely limiting travel from several   countries, including Iran. Bahram Qasemi, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, announced the decision Friday morning, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The agency reported that the decision had been made by “a special committee, which opposed to presence of the team after necessary studies. ” Mr. Qasemi said the ministry opposed the Americans’ participation because of Mr. Trump’s order. “We’re in talks about it right at the moment,” said Christina Kelley, the chief international ambassador for U. S. A. Wrestling. “We’re pretty devastated. ” A U. S. A. Wrestling statement, while noting that the group had not received official confirmation of the decision, said: “If these reports are true, U. S. A. Wrestling is extremely disappointed about this, which we believe would be an unacceptable situation. Wrestling is about competition and good will through sport, and is no place for politics. ” The event, the Freestyle World Cup, is scheduled for Feb. 16 and 17 in Kermanshah, Iran. Held annually, it pits the best wrestlers in the world in team competition. Last year, the event was held in Los Angeles, and it is scheduled to be held in Iowa City in 2018. Iran has won the event five years in a row. Americans and Iranians regularly wrestle in each other’s countries, with few problems, if any. Wrestling is one of the most popular sports in Iran: 43 of the nation’s 69 Olympic medals have come in wrestling. The United States and Iran worked together in 2013 to persuade the International Olympic Committee to keep wrestling in the Summer Games when it was threatened with removal. There is an international wrestling meet scheduled for May in Times Square, an annual contest pitting top Americans against international stars. But it is not clear if Iranians will be granted sports visas to compete. Mr. Trump’s order bars visitors from seven nations: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Nenad Lalovic, the president of United World Wrestling, the international federation, said in a statement: “Though we had hoped for a different outcome from Iran’s Foreign Ministry, we appreciate the complex nature of this decision. We are currently working to find a solution for the Freestyle World Cup as soon as possible. ” “United World Wrestling hosts a full calendar of events every season, and we’re certain to see American and Iranian wrestlers on the same mat again in the very near future,” it added. Mr. Trump’s order is a complicated issue for the United States Olympic Committee, which calls itself “the steward of the Olympic movement in the United States. ” The organization does not want to antagonize the president, so its response has been relatively muted. The committee is invested in a bid to bring the 2024 Summer Games to Los Angeles, and that bid’s chances have been damaged by the executive order, which alarmed some of the International Olympic Committee members who will select the host city. “We are disappointed for our wrestlers, who have been warmly welcomed by the Iranian public on many occasions,” said Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee. Jordan Burroughs, an American who won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics and who was to participate in the World Cup, told The Associated Press: “These executive decisions are always so far beyond your reach. You always feel like, ‘Well, the presidency or these strict laws or these Muslim bans or whatever you like to call them, they’ll never affect me.’ This is one of the few times where something so personal has occurred. ” “There is such a common respect for wrestlers in Iran,” Burroughs told NBC. “They love wrestling. They’re huge fans of mine. I’m bummed about that. I really wanted to be part of something great in what I consider a great country. Obviously, my views and our country’s views are different. ” Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump’s order. But American wrestling officials had been hopeful that an exception could be made to allow the American athletes to participate.",0
20309,20309,Here's The Trump Ad Hillary is SUING to Stop; Watch It Before It's GONE | The Federalist Papers,C.E. Dyer,"Pinterest 
The 2008 Democrat presidential primary got ugly between then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but you’d never know it given the ridiculous display by the Obamas on the campaign trail. Fortunately, a pro-Donald Trump super PAC decided to remind America… and Hillary Clinton is not too happy about it. 
Buzzfeed reported : 
The Clinton campaign has sent cease and desist letters to at least four local television stations in Florida demanding they stop running an ad paid for by a pro-Trump Super PAC featuring First Lady Michelle Obama — even as the PAC is expanding its ad campaign in North Carolina. 
The ad, titled “Can’t Run Her House,” is being run through the Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC, a subsidiary of the Make America Number 1 PAC, which is backing Trump’s campaign. 
During the 2008 presidential primary campaign, Michelle Obama said: 
One of the important aspects of this race is role-modeling what good families should look like. And my view is, if you can’t run your own house, you certainly can’t run the White House. You can’t do it. 
Barack Obama laughably claimed that the comment wasn’t about Clinton, but who else would it have been about? That’s what liberals do, though; they just deny something ever happened or wasn’t what it obviously was — and thanks to the biased mainstream media, they get away with it. 
Hogan Gidley, the PAC’s spokesperson, said of the legal move by the Clinton campaign: 
Hillary’s just angry because the ad is impactful, it’s working and it speaks directly to the women she’s been trying to con for years. Hillary’s own campaign said when Michelle Obama speaks out, “it has a real impact,” and indeed, we agree – because it was Mrs. Obama who correctly pointed out Hillary Clinton “certainly can’t run the White House.” 
Take a look at the ad below: 
You know, it really seems as if most Democrats are unable to just tell the truth. It looks pretty ridiculous for the Obamas to glowingly support Clinton and for Clinton to speak glowingly about the Obamas after the things they all said back in 2008. 
Part of the problem with Democrats is that they have the media in the tank for them, so they don’t have to own up to anything. Besides, it’s not like their moral compass, the ones that actually have one, would force them to do so. 
For the Clinton camp to resort to legal action over an ad that simply points out their hypocrisy is the height of absurdity. If you can’t stand the heat, don’t make deals with the devil … ",1
20310,20310,Home but Not Home: Four Generations of an Ethnic Korean Family in Japan - The New York Times,Krys Lee,"PACHINKOBy Min Jin Lee490 pp. Grand Central Publishing. $27. Min Jin Lee’s stunning novel “Pachinko”  —   her second, after “Free Food for Millionaires” (2007)  —   announces its ambitions right from the opening sentence: “History has failed us, but no matter. ” “Pachinko” chronicles four generations of an ethnic Korean family, first in   Korea in the early 20th century, then in Japan itself from the years before World War II to the late 1980s. The novel opens with an arranged marriage in Yeongdo, a fishing village at the southern tip of Korea. That union produces a daughter, Sunja, who falls in love at 16 with a prominent (and married) mobster. After Sunja becomes pregnant, a local pastor offers her a chance to escape by marrying him and immigrating together to his brother’s house in an ethnic Korean neighborhood in Osaka. Together, they embark into the fraught unknown. Pachinko, the    game ubiquitous throughout Japan, unifies the central concerns of identity, homeland and belonging. For the ethnic Korean population in Japan, discriminated against and shut out of traditional occupations, pachinko parlors are the primary mode of finding work and accumulating wealth. Called Zainichi, or foreign residents, ethnic Koreans are required to reapply for alien registration cards every three years even if they were born in Japan, and are rarely granted passports, making overseas travel nearly impossible. From a young age, Sunja’s oldest son sees being Korean as “a dark, heavy rock” his greatest, secret desire is to be Japanese. His younger brother, Mozasu, even after he accumulates great wealth through his pachinko parlors, confides to his closest Japanese friend: “In Seoul, people like me get called Japanese bastards, and in Japan, I’m just another dirty Korean no matter how much money I make or how nice I am. ” Mozasu’s son, Solomon, learns this too quickly after graduating from an American university. He returns to Tokyo on an expat package with the Japanese branch of a British investment bank, then is fired once his ethnic Korean connections are no longer needed for a business deal. Still, Solomon is of a new, less wounded generation. He believes there are still good Japanese people and sees himself as Japanese, too, “even if the Japanese didn’t think so. ” Like most memorable novels, however, “Pachinko” resists summary. In this sprawling book, history itself is a character. “Pachinko” is about outsiders, minorities and the politically disenfranchised. But it is so much more besides. Each time the novel seems to find its locus  —   Japan’s colonization of Korea, World War II as experienced in East Asia, Christianity, family, love, the changing role of women  —   it becomes something else. It becomes even more than it was. Despite the compelling sweep of time and history, it is the characters and their tumultuous lives that propel the narrative. Small details subtly reveal the characters’ secret selves and build to powerful moments. After Sunja arrives in Osaka, her modest life is underscored when she enters what is only the second restaurant of her life. When her husband, Isak, is finally cleared of   charges and released from jail looking “both new and ancient,” their oldest son is “unable to take his eyes off his father for fear he’d disappear. ” Their reunion is moving yet understated: Isak simply holds his son’s hand and says: “My dear boy. My blessing. ” Dozens more characters amplify the vortex of points of views: a hostess bar girl, a farmer who has “no wish for the war to end just yet” so that he can benefit from the higher   prices to realize “his grandfather’s dearest wish” of buying the adjoining land. The numerous shifts are occasionally jolting, but what is gained is a compassionate, clear gaze at the chaotic landscape of life itself. In this haunting epic tale, no one story seems too minor to be briefly illuminated. Lee suggests that behind the facades of wildly different people lie countless private desires, hopes and miseries, if we have the patience and compassion to look and listen.",0
20311,20311,"Doomsday Clock Moves Closer to Midnight, Signaling Concern Among Scientists - The New York Times",Jonah Engel Bromwich,"It is getting closer to midnight. On Thursday, the group of scientists who orchestrate the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic instrument informing the public when the earth is facing imminent disaster, moved its minute hand from three to two and a half minutes before the final hour. It was the closest the clock had been to midnight since 1953, the year after the United States and the Soviet Union conducted competing tests of the hydrogen bomb. Though scientists decide on the clock’s position, it is not a scientific instrument, or even a physical one. The movement of its symbolic hands is decided upon by the Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The organization introduced the clock on the cover of its June 1947 edition, placing it at seven minutes to midnight. Since then, it has moved closer to midnight and farther away, depending on the board’s conclusions. Thursday’s announcement was made by Rachel Bronson, the executive director and publisher of the bulletin. She was assisted by the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss, the climate scientist and meteorologist David Titley, and the former United States ambassador Thomas Pickering. Dr. Bronson, in a   interview, explained why the board had included the   mark in the measurement. She said that it was an   signal that was meant to acknowledge “what a dangerous moment we’re in, and how important it is for people to take note. ” “We’re so concerned about the rhetoric, and the lack of respect for expertise, that we moved it 30 seconds,” she said. “Rather than create panic, we’re hoping that this drives action. ” In an   for The New York Times, Dr. Titley and Dr. Krauss elaborated on their concerns, citing the increasing threats of nuclear weapons and climate change, as well as President Trump’s pledges to impede what they see as progress on both fronts, as reasons for moving the clock closer to midnight. “Never before has the Bulletin decided to advance the clock largely because of the statements of a single person,” they wrote. “But when that person is the new president of the United States, his words matter. ” The board has held the responsibility for the clock’s movements since 1973, when the bulletin’s editor, Eugene Rabinowitch, died. Composed of scientists, and nuclear and climate experts, the board meets biannually to discuss where the clock’s hands should fall in light of world events. In the 1950s, the scientists feared nuclear annihilation, and since then, the board has begun to consider other existential threats, including climate change, compromised biosecurity and artificial intelligence. There were crises that the clock was not quick enough to take into account. The Cuban Missile Crisis, for instance, in 1962, did not change the hands of the clock, which at the time stood at seven minutes to midnight. An explanation on the Bulletin’s website accounts for this seeming lapse in timekeeping: “The Cuban Missile Crisis, for all its potential and ultimate destruction, only lasted a few weeks,” it says. “However, the lessons were quickly apparent when the United States and the Soviet Union installed the first hotline between the two capitals to improve communications, and, of course, negotiated the 1963 test ban treaty, ending all atmospheric nuclear testing. ” The end of the Cold War came as a relief to those who had lived in fear of nuclear annihilation for decades, and the minute hand slowly moved away from danger. In 1990, it was at 10 minutes to midnight. The next year, it was a full 17 minutes away, at the relatively undisturbing time of 11:43. “The illusion that tens of thousands of nuclear weapons are a guarantor of national security has been stripped away,” the Bulletin said at the time. But over the next two decades the clock slowly ticked back. Conflict between India and Pakistan, both of whom staged nuclear weapons tests three weeks apart, had the clock at nine minutes to midnight in 1998. By 2007, fears about Iranian and North Korean nuclear capacity had pushed it to 11:55. By 2015, the scientists were back in a state of unmitigated concern, with the clock at three minutes to midnight, the closest it had been since 1984. “Unchecked climate change, global nuclear weapons modernizations, and outsized nuclear weapons arsenals pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of humanity,” the bulletin said. “World leaders have failed to act with the speed or on the scale required to protect citizens from potential catastrophe. ” “These failures of political leadership endanger every person on Earth,” it added.",0
20312,20312,Trump Throws A Fit When Asked Why He Is Promoting His Hotel Instead Of Campaigning,Jason Easley,"Donald Trump had himself a tantrum on CNN after he was asked why he was spending the day promoting his hotel instead of campaigning in swing states. 
Video: Dana Bash: Is your DC hotel opening free advertising?Donald Trump: “No, not at all” https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/9HHqooom8r 
— CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 26, 2016 
With just 13 days until election day, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Trump why he is promoting his hotel instead of campaigning in swing states, “I say the following: You have been covering me for the last— long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I’ve been doing this for weeks straight. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you’ll ask me that question. I think that’s a very rude question, to be honest with you.” 
Trump can’t defend why he is wasting precious time promoting his business interests instead of campaigning. Trump doesn’t have a single campaign event scheduled until 7 PM. He has given up a critical day of campaign time to get publicity for his new hotel. 
When Trump got called out for some very unpresidential scheduling priorities, his response was to attack the reporter. 
The Republican nominee is not behaving like a person who is willing to give everything to be elected the next president, and every time he leaves his Fox News bubble, Donald Trump opens his mouth and reminds voters of why he should never be elected president.

Donald Trump moved to diversify his cabinet with selections for three key positions. He chose Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina as the ambassador to the United Nations and Betsy DeVos, a charter school advocate, for education secretary. He is also nearing an announcement of Ben Carson as secretary of housing and urban development. Ms. Haley, seen above last year, is a rising star in Republican politics and has sparred bitterly with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump will hold meetings in    his upscale club in Florida, over Thanksgiving. The use of his vast real estate holdings is raising questions about whether he is exploiting the high profile of the presidency to draw attention to his properties. Here is a visual visitors’ log of notable people who filed through Trump Tower in a single day earlier this week. Mr. Trump plans to bar registered lobbyists making donations to activities surrounding his inauguration, but corporations and wealthy donors are welcome to contribute. 3. Hillary Clinton has widened her lead in the popular vote to 1. 5 percentage points, a spread not seen for a losing candidate since the disputed election of 1876. The news prompted calls from liberal activists for audits in three states won narrowly by Mr. Trump: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Above, an election watch party hosted by the American Embassy in South Korea. ____ 4. A Thanksgiving dinner will be served to about 2, 000 people protesting an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota on Thursday  —   and two celebrities, Jane Fonda and Shailene Woodley, said they would be on hand to help. The state’s leaders are pressuring President Obama to authorize the pipeline’s completion. Here’s a detailed map of conflicts along its   path. ____ 5. A London jury sentenced a man with a history of extremist   beliefs to life in prison for the murder of Jo Cox, a British lawmaker, a week before the country’s “Brexit” vote to leave the European Union.

20314,20314,The Political and Cultural Richness of Kashmiriyat,Nyla Ali Khan,"Email 
The various communities in the state of J & K – Kashmiri Muslims, Kashmiri Pandits, Dogras and Ladakhis – have tried time and again to form a national consciousness in order to name a cultural alterity through the nation. The construction of “Kashmiriyat,” or a syncretic cultural ethos, by Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and his comrades involved culling selected cultural fragments from an imagined past that would enfold both the Pandits and the Muslims. But due to the regional sentiments that are so well entrenched in the psyche of the people, this attempt is still in a volatile stage. 
The notion of “Kashmiriyat,” forged by my maternal grandfather Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, was not handed down to me as an unachievable and abstract construct; on the contrary, it was crystallized for me as the eradication of a feudal structure and its insidious ramifications; the right of the tiller to the land he worked on; the unacceptability of any political solution that did not take the aspirations and demands of the Kashmiri people into consideration; the right of Kashmiris to high offices in education, the bureaucracy and government; the availability of medical and educational facilities in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh; the preservation of literatures, shrines and historical artifacts that defined an important aspect of “Kashmiriyat”; formation of the Constituent Assembly of J & K to institutionalize the constitution of the state in 1951, which was an enormous leap toward the process of democratization; the fundamental right of both women and men to free education up to the university level; equal opportunities afforded to both sexes in the workplace; the nurturing of a contact zone in social, political and intellectual ideologies and institutions; pride in a cultural identity that was generated in a space created by multiple perspectives. 
The notion of ‘Kashmiriyat’, or of the syncretism of Kashmir, as I mentioned earlier, was the secular credo of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah’s All Jammu and Kashmir NC, popularized in the 1940s and 50s to defeat the centralizing strategies of the successive regimes of independent India. This significant concept does not attempt to simplify the ambiguity and complexity of religious, social and cultural identities. It neither attempts to assert a fixed identity nor reinforce the idea of purity of culture. I would veer away from adopting an image of this secular credo that is created by the unitary discourses it deplores. On the contrary, “Kashmiriyat” brings about a metamorphosis in the determinate concept of the Indian state, and creates a situation in which the nation-states of India and Pakistan are forced to confront an alternative epistemology. At a time of political and social upheaval in the state, this notion engendered a consciousness of place that offered a critical perspective from which to formulate alternatives. Without negating the historicity of the notion, this theoretical fiction was deployed by Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and his colleagues in order to forge a strategic essentialism that would enable the creation of a sovereign Kashmiri identity. It certainly was not a flawless notion. Professor R. L. Hangloo, eminent historian of Kashmiri Pandit descent provided a complex and concise definition of “ Kashmiriyat ”: 
“ Kashmiriyat is a far wider concept than the harmonious relationship cutting across religious and sectarian divisions. Kashmiriyat is the externally endowed and internally evolved phenomenon of co-existence at the social, religious, political, spatial, cultural and other institutional levels among Kashmirees of all shades that inhabited Kashmir. Kashmiriyat has evolved as a result of special circumstances that are rooted in Kashmir‘s topographical centrality that entitled Kashmir to imbibing, interacting and assimilating a variety of world cultures in consonance with Kashmiri sensibilities that reflect a nuanced and sophisticated approach that did not disturb the patterns of production and cultural manners reflecting the Kashmiri genius. This specificity has stemmed from the historical processes that the region of Kashmir has embraced both in peace and turmoil for centuries. Kashmir has always been surrounded by some of the world’s greatest civilizations such as China, Persia/Iran, Central Asia and India. Kashmir and Kashmirees were always at the center of this world and not on the periphery which is reflected in the assimilation of their residual practices of religions. Note that while Kashmir maybe on a fairly marginal point on the map of the state of India, Kashmir as a region was historically at the epicenter of a much larger world space and world civilization. This centrality endowed the region with a superiority and self identity that has assimilated the social and religious-cultural traditions of this greater region and traits of greater cultures throughout history to evolve and strengthen what came to constitute Kashmiriyat . This sense of superior self identity has grown over centuries as Kashmiriyat among Kashmirees both within and out side Kashmir. 
Living together, untroubled by diversities of religion, racial, cultural, material, and political and other identities, the notion of Kashmiriyat became the bedrock of identity which consolidated itself increasingly when Islam entered into the Valley. Before the thirteenth century, even though there were plural religious sects, they neither saw eye to eye with each other nor were they external to Kashmir in totality. Shaivites facilitated the decline of Buddhists in Kashmir; the Vaishnavas had to keep their identity concealed to escape the wrath of the Shaivites. The pre-Islamic history is replete with religious, ethnic, racial and other conflicts. The battles of Dammaras, Ekangas, Tantrins, Khasas and others were perpetual features of pre-Islamic Kashmiri society. There was a long drawn conflict and contestation within Islamic society before rapprochement took place between the orthodox Muslims and heterodox sects. The entrance of Islam in Kashmir coincided with the end of this struggle. It was this rapprochement that disallowed Kashmirees from seeing any contradiction between the preaching of Islam and the practice of upholding the Heretical tradition (that is, acknowledging the divine power of the local, the Rishi) in Kashmir. Therefore the kind of Islam that entered Kashmir was devoid of any orthodoxy. It was only after the arrival of Islam that Lalleshwari and Sheikh Noor –ud-din (Nund Reshi) interacted to produce the atmosphere and philosophy of co-existence and tolerance at popular level. This interaction entailed massive changes in the world view of Kashmirees that reflected a truly remarkable and world encompassing shift in every aspect of their sensibility as well.” 
Uncertainty about the status of the former princely state has loomed large since 1947. In an atmosphere of unpredictability, in the frightening darkness of political intrigue, in the paranoia of political deception, the fungi of undemocratic policies and methods continue to grow unabated. The unresolved Kashmir dispute poses a danger of monstrous proportions to the stability of the Indian subcontinent. Is the former princely state of J & K a postcolonial state? Postcolonialism refers to a phase undergone after the decline and dismantling of the European empires by the mid-twentieth century, when the peoples of many Asian, African and Caribbean countries were left to create new governments and forge national identities. The ideology that has been propounded by the governments of India and Pakistan reflects and produces the interests of state-sponsored agencies and institutionson both sides of the Line of Control (LOC). These institutions have couched the debased discourse of exploitation in the language of culture and religion, a strategy that has led to the relegation of the subjectivity, historical understanding and traditions of the Kashmiri populace. As the eminent Palestinian–American scholar Edward Said (1991: 29) noted, “All human activity depends on controlling a radically unstable reality to which words approximate only by will or convention.” Representatives of the privileged centre of power silence the voices that are on the margins of mainstream society and politics. These privileged centres have always constrained reality by imposing their ideological schema, which underpins their powerful positionality, on it. Their ability to conjure images and re-stretch boundaries that serve their set of beliefs has rendered them a force to reckon with. These ideas expounded by the powers-that-be portray Kashmiris as a stereotypical and predictable entity. 
This delineation of the Kashmiri subject was foregrounded by an imperial agent of the British Raj, Sir Walter Lawrence, Settlement Commissioner of J & K, in his The Vale of Kashmir ([1895] 2005). This politically and culturally misleading portrayal of the Kashmiri subject has been underscored by the policies of the governments of India and Pakistan vis-à-vis Jammu and Kashmir, which is why the authority of democratically elected representatives in that region has always been curbed. The policies of the two governments follow the much-trodden path of totalitarianism and spell a pattern of doom for Kashmir. The unnecessary and unjustified postponement of the resolution of the Kashmir conflict has insidiously gnawed at the tenuous relations between India and Pakistan. The issue has also, for better or worse, been thrust on to the stage of global politics, and its volatility has contributed to the destabilization of the Indian subcontinent. Josef Korbel (2002: 304) wrote with foresight that “whatever the future may have in store, the free world shares with India and Pakistan common responsibility for the fate of democracy and it awaits with trepidation the solution of the Kashmir problem. Its own security may depend on such a settlement.”",1
20315,20315,Jordan Frees Soldier Who Killed 7 Israeli Schoolgirls in ’97 Rampage - The New York Times,Isabel Kershner and Rana F. Sweis,"JERUSALEM  —   The fragile treaty between the two former enemies was not even three years old when a Jordanian soldier went on a shooting rampage and killed seven Israeli schoolgirls visiting a park in a border area known as the Island of Peace. On Sunday, almost 20 years after that March 13, 1997, attack, the Jordanian authorities released the soldier, Ahmed Daqamseh, a former corporal, after he effectively completed his term. Amid the grief and outrage over what became known as the Island of Peace massacre, King Hussein, then the ruler of Jordan, managed to salvage the spirit of reconciliation and provide some balm. The king paid a rare visit to Israel and made condolence calls to each of the bereaved families. Kneeling to speak with them as they sat on the floor in their homes as part of the Jewish mourning custom of shiva, he apologized and said: “Your daughter is like my daughter. Your loss is my loss. ” While the visit angered many in Jordan, it was seen as a gesture of friendship and humility by many in Israel and the West. Two decades later, Mr. Daqamseh’s release rekindled some of those emotions. The   peace has proved firm and lasting, but it still exists mainly at the government level and has not been popularly embraced. The Island of Peace, about 12 miles south of the Sea of Galilee, was formally returned to Jordan when it made peace with Israel in fall 1994, but was then leased back to an Israeli kibbutz. Mr. Daqamseh fired on the girls, who were on a class outing, from a border post in Jordanian territory. After the attack, a Jordanian medical team gave Mr. Daqamseh a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder a military court sentenced him to life in prison. Life sentences are not   in Jordan, and can essentially be commuted after 20 years. Mr. Daqamseh, who also injured five other girls and a teacher in the rampage, said at the time that the seventh and eighth graders had mocked him as he was performing his prayers. Early on Sunday, Mr. Daqamseh returned to his family’s home in Ibdir, a village in the governorate of Irbid in northern Jordan. Roya News, an independent Jordanian station, broadcast video of his homecoming, and photographs spread widely in the local news media. Israeli radio and news sites described the reception Mr. Daqamseh received from his family and other   as a hero’s welcome, also posting photographs and video of the local celebrations. A Jordanian military spokesman confirmed the release, but the government appeared to be trying to keep it low key. The police prevented reporters from reaching Ibdir later on Sunday, citing orders from the local governor, who demanded that journalists obtain permission from the Ministry of Interior. Mr. Daqamseh, now in his 40s, emerged from prison with patches of gray hair and sunken eyes. He was defiant and showed no remorse. In his first statement to the news media from his home, he said, “There is no country named Israel,” adding that any normalization of ties with Israel and the notion that the   conflict would be resolved by means of a   solution were both “lies. ” Some Jordanians continued to see Mr. Daqamseh as a symbol of an   movement against the   treaty. The Israeli government and the bereaved families had protested earlier calls in Jordan for Mr. Daqamseh’s prison term to be cut short. There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials on Sunday, and relatives who spoke to the news media appeared mostly resigned to his release. “I always say that our peace with Jordan is with the royal family, not the people or their parliament,” Yisrael Fatihi, whose daughter, Sivan, 13, was killed in the attack, told Ynet, a Hebrew news site. Hezi Cohen, the father of Nirit, 13, another victim, described his family’s daily pain. On one hand, he said, Mr. Daqamseh had served his full sentence. On the other, he said, “If he had received 20 years for each girl he murdered, he would have rotted in prison for the rest of his life. ”",0
20316,20316,Palme d’Or Goes to a Ken Loach Film at Cannes - The New York Times,Manohla Dargis,"CANNES, France  —   The 69th Cannes Film Festival, an event this year defined by peerless highs and embarrassing lows, ended on Sunday when the Palme d’Or was awarded to “I, Daniel Blake,” a film about a carpenter with a heart condition up against the heartlessness of bureaucracy, from the veteran British director Ken Loach. The award was presented by Mel Gibson. Mr. Loach, a previous winner for “The Wind That Shakes the Barley,” accepted his prize first in French before switching to English. “We’re in the grip of a project of austerity,” he said, invoking the “catastrophe” of neoliberalism. He talked of cinema’s tradition of speaking to the “powerful and the mighty” and the need to show that “another world is possible and necessary. ” This year’s jury for the feature competition was led by George Miller (here in 2015 with “Mad Max: Fury Road”) who lauded “the feast of cinema,” and also included the directors Arnaud Desplechin and Laszlo Nemes (his “Son of Saul” won the Grand Prize last year) a producer, Katayoon Shahabi and a clutch of internationally recognizable names: Kirsten Dunst, Valeria Golino, Mads Mikkelsen, Vanessa Paradis and Donald Sutherland. The ceremony included a brief tribute to   Léaud, the screen immortal who played Antoine Doinel for François Truffaut, beginning with “The 400 Blows” Mr. Léaud received an honorary Palme d’Or presented by a visibly moved Mr. Desplechin. The best actor award went to Shahab Hosseini, one of the stars of the Iranian movie “Forushande” (“The Salesman”) from the director Asghar Farhadi. This smooth, schematic drama turns on a married couple who are performing in a production of Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman” and whose lives are upended when the wife is attacked. Mr. Farhadi also won for best screenplay. The best actress prize was given to Jaclyn Jose, the star of “‘Ma’ Rosa,” a slice of naturalism from the Philippine director Brillante Mendoza. Ms. Jose plays a tough,   drug dealer who peddles dope out of her small Manila store and, with her addict husband, is swept up in police corruption. The best director prize was, surprisingly, split between the Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, for “Graduation,” and to the French director Olivier Assayas, for “Personal Shopper. ” The Jury Prize (effectively third place) went to “American Honey,” from the British director Andrea Arnold. “When I’m happy, I want to dance,” Ms. Arnold said, swaying to the accompanying music. The Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan won the Grand Prix, second only to the Palme d’Or, for “It’s Only the End of the World,” a decision booed by the press, who watched the ceremony in a live feed from a theater in the same building. “Thank you for feeling the emotion of the film,” Mr. Dolan said, choking up as booing continued from critics across the hallway. “The Happiest Day in the Life of Olli Maki,” a    movie about a boxer, from the Finnish director Juho Kuosmanen, was awarded the prize for Un Certain Regard, a section reserved for younger and sometimes more adventurous filmmakers. The Caméra d’Or, for best first feature, went to “Divines,” from the French director Houda Benyamina it screened in La Quinzaine des Realisateurs, a program that runs parallel with the official selection. The Palme for the best short film was presented to “Timecode,” from the Spanish director Juanjo Giménez. Information about other winners is at www. .   .",0
20317,20317,"Monitoring May Have ‘Incidentally’ Picked Up Trump Aides, House Member Says - The New York Times","Matthew Rosenberg, Adam Goldman and Emmarie Huetteman","WASHINGTON  —   For weeks, President Trump has insisted that President Barack Obama tapped his phones even as the F. B. I. director and members of Mr. Trump’s own party said there was no evidence for his charge. But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump got an assist from a powerful House Republican who said the president or his closest associates may have been “incidentally” swept up in foreign surveillance by American spy agencies. Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, introduced the new claim into the deepening controversy over Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Yet Mr. Nunes also told reporters on Wednesday that he had no evidence to support Mr. Trump’s claim that he was directly or personally wiretapped. Democrats quickly denounced the disclosure and said it bolstered the need for an independent investigation to replace the House inquiry being led by Mr. Nunes. Mr. Trump responded positively to Mr. Nunes’s remarks. “I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found,” the president told reporters at the White House, evidently referring to sources Mr. Nunes said he would not name. Mr. Trump said he felt vindicated, up to a point. “I somewhat do,” he said. Mr. Nunes acknowledged that the incidental intelligence gathering on Trump associates  —   during the presidential transition late last year, when Mr. Obama was in office  —   was not necessarily unlawful. American intelligence agencies typically monitor foreign officials of allied and hostile countries, and they routinely sweep up communications linked to Americans who may be taking part in the conversation or are being spoken about. The real issue, Mr. Nunes told reporters, was that he could figure out the identities of Trump associates from reading reports about intercepted communications that were shared among Obama administration officials with top security clearances. He said some Trump associates were also identified by name in the reports. Normally, intelligence agencies mask the identities of American citizens who are incidentally present in intercepted communications. But nothing about the investigations into Russian election interference is routine. In making his claims, first in a news conference on Capitol Hill and then in the West Wing driveway after meeting with Mr. Trump at the White House, Mr. Nunes, who served on the president’s transition team, appeared to be trying to steer the public debate away from the investigations into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia during the election. “I don’t want to get too much into the details, but these were intelligence reports, and it brings up a lot of concern about whether things were properly minimized or not,” said Mr. Nunes, who said the surveillance was not related to Russia. “What I have read bothers me, and I think it should bother the president himself and his team, because I think some of it seems to be inappropriate. ” Mr. Nunes, who has spent months assailing leaks of classified information about Mr. Trump from anonymous officials, refused on Wednesday to identify who had allowed him to read the intelligence reports on the surveillance. He would only say that the people had proper security clearances and needed to be protected. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, who has also complained about leaks of classified information, had no such quibble with what Mr. Nunes disclosed on Wednesday. “I think it’s startling information,” he told reporters. Despite the plaudits from the White House, Democrats said Mr. Nunes had badly damaged his credibility in his apparent attempt to shore up Mr. Trump’s. His decision to dash off to the White House and brief Mr. Trump in the middle of his committee’s investigation into Russian interference  —   which includes the president  —   raised questions about the independence and viability of the House inquiry he is leading. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said Mr. Nunes needed to decide whether he was going to oversee the intelligence committee or be a White House surrogate. “He can’t do both,” Mr. Schiff said in a hastily arranged news conference in response to Mr. Nunes. “This is deeply troubling. ” Mr. Schiff said that “there is more than circumstantial evidence now” of collusion between Trump associates and Russian officials. The House Intelligence Committee is running one of three investigations into Russian interference in the election (the Senate and the F. B. I. are the other two). Before Wednesday, Democrats had already expressed skepticism that the House investigation could rise above partisan politics, and Mr. Nunes’s statements only deepened their concerns. Mr. Schiff, who said he had not seen the information Mr. Nunes cited, said the mere fact that Trump associates could be identified in intelligence reports, all of which remain classified, “does not indicate that there was any flaw in the procedures followed by the intelligence agencies. ” Current and former intelligence officials backed up Mr. Schiff’s assessment. “If the F. B. I. has asked for information about Trump or any of his cronies relative to N. S. A. collection overseas, it wasn’t for grins,” said Frank Montoya Jr. a former F. B. I. agent who served as the government’s senior counterintelligence official. They “asked because there was a legitimate concern about suspicious behavior that might warrant an investigation, or because an investigation was already underway. The fact that this news isn’t about Russia only makes me more concerned about the actions of our president. ” Apart from names of Trump associates, it was unclear what exactly was in the intercepts. Mr. Nunes said there were multiple Trump associates named in them, but Mr. Schiff said it appeared that only one person was identified by name. Mr. Schiff said he came to that conclusion after speaking directly with Mr. Nunes. Mr. Nunes’s concern, Mr. Schiff said, “was he could still figure out the identities of some of the parties even though the names were masked. ” Democrats and intelligence officials questioned whether Mr. Nunes had violated the law in discussing classified reports. Mr. Nunes said he had not broken the law even as he acknowledged that the reports were classified. Several people are known to be under scrutiny in the Russia investigation, including Paul Manafort, who stepped down as chairman of the Trump campaign in August amid reports his name was in a secret ledger in Ukraine listing    payments for consulting work he did for a   government there. On Wednesday, The Associated Press reported new details of Mr. Manafort’s activities in Ukraine, including a proposal he is said to have drafted in 2005 to do similar work for   interests in other former Soviet republics. The plan was presented to a Russian oligarch with whom Mr. Manafort had a business relationship, Oleg Deripaska, a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia who agreed to pay Mr. Manafort $10 million for the work. It is unclear how far the plan got or whether money changed hands. Mr. Manafort issued a statement denying he did any work for the Russian government. Mr. Deripaska, via a spokeswoman, said the only payments he made to Mr. Manafort were tied to private business ventures.",0
20318,20318,Slovenia Adds Water To Constitution As Fundamental Right For All People,Lance Schuttler,"Slovenia Adds Water To Constitution As Fundamental Right For All People Nov 20, 2016 1 0 
“Everyone has the right to drinkable water.” This is what Slovenia’s newest article in their constitution states as the parliament voted 64-0 in favor of the amendment. 
This amendment to their constitution will serve to make water a right for all people in Slovenia and will stop it from being commercialized. Slovenia has some of the cleanest water in the world. 
The Guardian reports that the newest amendment states: 
“Water resources represent a public good that is managed by the state. Water resources are primary and durably used to supply citizens with potable water and households with water and, in this sense, are not a market commodity. “ 
Miro Cerar, who is the Slovenian Prime Minister, was in full support of the measure and stated that: 
“People should protect water-the 21st century’s liquid gold- at the highest level. Slovenian water has very good quality and, because of it’s value, in the future it will certainly be the target of foreign countries and international corporations’ appetites. Pressure over it will increase and we must not give in.” Water and people first, corporations second. 
This marks Slovenia as the first European Union country to declare water as a common right for all people. According to Rampedre , there are 15 other countries in the world who have also done the same. 
This news comes at a great time not only for Slovenia, but also for all people around the world who are protecting water supplies, namely the water protectors in the United States at Standing Rock. With Slovenia making this amendment to the constitution, is it time that the United States does the same? 
The lies we are being told by those heavily vested in putting in the pipeline that would run under the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s water supply is being seen through. The people are awake and realize the severe consequences this pipeline would create not only for the tribe, but everyone that is affected by the water that runs downstream. Imagine all of the people affected by a pipeline break if this were to happen. 
Again, this news comes at a perfect time for water protectors everywhere. If an entire country can amend it’s constitution to protect water, then why can’t others? While the challenge at Standing Rock continues on, this latest story on Slovenia protecting it’s people and it’s water is a major victory for humanity. If you have friends or family helping to protect water, please share this good news with them and the world. Light will always overcome darkness.

Bei seinem letzten Deutschlandbesuch als US-Präsident häufen sich die Hinweise darauf, dass Barack Obama nicht etwa hier ist, um mit Angela Merkel eine seiner wichtigsten Verbündeten ein letztes Mal zu treffen, sondern heimlich nach einer neuen Wohnung sucht. Das melden mehrere Quellen aus dem Umfeld der Bundeskanzlerin. Schon kurz nach Obamas Landung in Berlin war Beobachtern aufgefallen, dass sich der US-Präsident bei Merkel auffällig oft nach Immobilienpreisen erkundigte und einzelne Räume von Gebäuden, die er besuchte, mit einem Zollstock ausmaß. Auch für Parkmöglichkeiten sowie Entfernungen zu Schulen und Supermärkten habe sich Obama immer wieder brennend interessiert. ""How much is the house behind us, Mr. Sour?"" ""Auf mich wirkt das schon ein wenig verdächtig, dass der Präsident so kurz vor dem Ende seiner Amtszeit und quasi direkt nach Donald Trumps Wahlsieg ganz plötzlich noch einmal dringend nach Europa muss"", erklärt eine Mitarbeiterin des Kanzleramts, der an der Planung von Obamas Deutschlandaufenthalt beteiligt war. ""Er hat sogar einen kleinen Stapel mit Proben verschiedener Tapetenmuster dabei, die er in fast jedem Raum an die Wand hält."" Außerdem habe Obama Merkel gefragt, ob er einige sperrige Möbelstücke, die er nach eigener Aussage ""zufällig"" in der Air Force One mit sich führte, vorübergehend im Kanzleramt ""zwischenlagern"" dürfe. Spätestens im Januar wolle er sie wieder abholen. Auch beim Programm der First Lady gab es verdächtige Momente, etwa als sich Michelle Obama von Merkels Gatten Joachim Sauer deutsche Immobilien-Apps zeigen ließ und sich nach dem Unterschied zwischen Kalt- und Warmmieten erkundigte. Eine persönliche Erklärung des US-Präsidenten zu den Gerüchten steht noch aus – es ist jedoch davon auszugehen, dass er auf der für heute geplanten Pressekonferenz mit Angela Merkel im Kanzleramt Stellung beziehen wird. Mehrere Mitarbeiter wollen Obama bereits dabei beobachtet haben, wie er vor einem Spiegel die berühmten Worte seines Amtsvorgängers John F.

20321,20321,"Angry Town Hall Meetings on Health Care Law, and Few Answers - The New York Times",Thomas Kaplan,"PEWAUKEE, Wis.  —   Michelle Roelandts had a question for her congressman: If the Affordable Care Act and its premium subsidies were repealed, what would happen when her daughter turns 26 this year and needs to get her own health insurance while attending law school? Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a durable Wisconsin Republican who has served in the House since 1979, had little to offer in response. “If I could give you an answer today, I would, but I can’t,” Mr. Sensenbrenner said at a    meeting on Saturday, where about 70 people packed a room at the Pewaukee Public Library. Ms. Roelandts’s question and others like it are being asked with increasing anger and urgency across the country, and Republicans have found themselves on the defensive  —   for all their fury aimed at repealing the law, so far they have not agreed on an alternative. Soon after, a man yelled to Mr. Sensenbrenner: “How many times did you vote to repeal without knowing what the replacement would be? How many times? Dozens!” The congressman, who prides himself on his prolific schedule of    meetings, banged his gavel and insisted that his rules for civility be obeyed. While Mr. Sensenbrenner did not face the kind of anger that some of his peers did in recent days, he must answer the same question: Is this resistance a sign of a sustainable organic movement, or one that will soon flame out? And like his colleagues, he is also coming to grips with how much he will be saddled with the combative comments made by President Trump. Mr. Sensenbrenner, in an interview, attributed the turnout at his gatherings to “organized opposition by people who were on the losing side of the election. ” Facing restive audiences in public meetings is not new, but in the age of social media, an ugly scene in one congressional district can quickly attract widespread attention. “I’d be lying to you if I told you it was fun,” he said. In California, Representative Tom McClintock was escorted by police officers after a    meeting earlier this month in Utah, the crowd chanted “Do your job!” at Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the Oversight Committee. At a meeting last week, House Republicans were advised on security precautions so they would be prepared for protesters at    meetings or their district offices. The questions from voters on display this weekend at a series of    meetings in Wisconsin’s Fifth Congressional District, many of which were focused on the future of the health care law, underscored the quandary many lawmakers are facing even in solidly Republican districts. The imminent problem: Constituents want answers, and without any consensus on how to go about replacing the law, Republicans have little to say. “It’s kind of like, you know, getting a   jigsaw puzzle for Christmas,” Mr. Sensenbrenner said, “and, you know, cleaning off the dining room table and seeing how long it takes to put all the 30, 000 pieces together in the right place. It’s not going to be easy. ” Mr. Sensenbrenner won   last year by 37 percentage points. His   district, which includes suburbs around Milwaukee, voted decisively for Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton. At three    meetings over the weekend, Mr. Sensenbrenner sat at the front of the room to take questions from people who submitted slips of paper listing their name and address. When he called on people, he read their names and where they live  —   a practice that makes people “less likely to make fools of themselves,” he said in the interview. At the meetings, he faced crowds that were adversarial but generally civil, and he fielded questions on a range of issues. At moments when the gatherings grew a bit unruly, he did not hesitate to bang his gavel. Like a frustrated   teacher, he offered some unsolicited advice about comportment. “This is not a session on who can cheer or boo the loudest,” he said as he began the Pewaukee meeting on Saturday, urging people to “be respectful of opinions that you do not share. ” The tough questioning of Republican lawmakers has been driven partly by concerns over health care, but also by outrage over Mr. Trump’s presidency. That was true in Wisconsin, too. Mr. Sensenbrenner, who has long worked on immigration issues in Congress, said the executive order on immigration was “completely messed up” and a “train wreck. ” And he suggested he would be of little assistance in reining in Mr. Trump. “Do you think I’m able to control anybody else’s mouth, from the president on down?” he asked. Repeatedly, the questions Mr. Sensenbrenner faced over the weekend showed the challenge that lawmakers have in explaining the effects of repealing the Affordable Care Act, especially now, when Republicans have yet to coalesce around a replacement plan. Pressed by one questioner to oppose a replacement for the health care law if that replacement would raise costs for sick people, he explained that “there are winners and losers” when bills are passed. A woman told him she learned she had skin cancer in 2005, and she asked about coverage for people with   conditions. Another woman told him that her    mother was in a nursing home, and she wondered whether changing Medicaid to give each state a fixed amount of money, called a block grant, could cause her mother to be “put out on the street. ” Leigh Levas, 35, a medical technologist, told him that her    daughter had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. “I’ve been sending him postcards with her photo, because I think he needs to see the people that it affects,” Ms. Levas said after the Pewaukee meeting. Mr. Sensenbrenner offered a reassurance that some popular aspects of the health care law would remain: insurers would not be able to deny coverage because of   conditions, young adults could stay on their parents’ health plan until they are 26, and lifetime limits on coverage would not be allowed. And he acknowledged the stakes of the repeal effort. “From a political standpoint, we Republicans know that we will own whatever the replacement will be, just as Obama and the Democrats own the A. C. A. ,” he told Ms. Roelandts, who asked about health coverage for her daughter. “We got to get it right, and we got to get it right the first time. ” Ms. Roelandts, an accountant, said later that she was not happy with his answer. “I kind of interpret it as they don’t really know what they’re going to do yet,” she said, adding that she was alarmed by the comparison to a   jigsaw puzzle. “Don’t talk about repealing something until you have valid ideas on the table for replacing it,” she said. “I mean, it’s causing me to literally lose sleep at night. ” Still, Mr. Sensenbrenner was blunt and unapologetic about the Republican push for dismantling President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. “I won by 146, 000 votes,” he said in the interview. “I represent the majority. Now, they’re a vocal minority. ”",0
20322,20322,"Obamacare 2.0 Guts Enforcement, Gives Illegal Aliens Health Care Through Identity Fraud - Breitbart",Katie McHugh,"The Obamacare 2. 0 bill pushed by some Republicans strips out even Obamacare’s weak protections preventing illegal aliens from signing up for health care meant for citizens. [A draft of the bill, released by the House Committee on Ways and Means, cannot even include   provisions requiring officials to check an enrollee’s immigration status, the Conservative Review’s Daniel Horowitz warns, calling it a “gift to illegal aliens. ”  Obamacare included provisions from an earlier bill allowing illegal aliens with fraudulent documents to apply while the government and Obamacare managers looked the other way. Eager for welfare state clients and looking to grease the skids for a massive amnesty down the road, Obamacare navigators signed up thousands of illegal aliens for benefits. “President Obama had already paved the path for illegal alien Obamacare when he signed the massive expansion of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program ( ) in 2009,” conservative author Michelle Malkin explained in March 2014. “As I’ve reported previously, the law loosened eligibility requirements for legal immigrants and their children by watering down document and evidentiary standards —  making it easy for individuals to use fake Social Security cards to apply for benefits with little to no chance of getting caught. In addition, Obama’s   expansion revoked Medicaid application time limits that were part of the 1996 welfare reform law. ” Obamacare has no meaningful, robust protections in place against illegal aliens claiming health care. The law claimed to exclude illegals, but in practice, made no effort to verify that the people applying for health care were citizens. Now, Republicans are about to take that problem and make it much worse by gutting enforcement, Horowitz says: Although Obamacare didn’t require photo ID and fingerprints to verify identity, it did harness the Department of Homeland Security’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database. Thus, officials were at least able to check immigration status against Social Security numbers. The problem with this bill is that because it tweaks Obamacare and creates a new massive entitlement system through the budget reconciliation process, it cannot have the statutory effect of mandating HHS and IRS work with Citizenship and Immigration Services to use the SAVE database because that issue is outside the jurisdiction of the reporting committees. And no subject matter from other committees can be included in reconciliation. Thus, to pass Obamacare 2. 0 instead of plain repeal via budget reconciliation, Republicans must use weaker verification language. Allowing illegals access to health care through fraud is a disastrous move, Horowitz shows. What Republicans are doing is almost inexplicable: Ramping up the most punishing aspects of Obamacare while removing even its   requirements against granting illegal aliens health care. Except, according to Horowitz, they never intended to repeal the “meat and potatoes” of Obamacare at all. There’s also the deeply troubling aspect of Republicans encouraging illegal immigration with enticing incentives and promises not to punish  . Illegal alien identity theft is a serious, widespread problem. Since it’s all but impossible to work and collect benefits in the U. S. without valid ID and documentation, illegals commit felonies to steal Americans’ Social Security numbers and forge tax documents. “The demand is so great for counterfeit documents because the illegal alien population wants to work —  that’s the majority of their motivation for wanting to come to this country,” one former immigration officer told Fox News in December. “So there’s a huge demand for those documents that are required to pass the employment eligibility verification procedures  …    . In every neighborhood where there’s a significant illegal alien population, there are at least several document vendors who supply this service,” he said. Illegals typically buy three fraudulent documents: A counterfeit resident alien card or work authorization card, plus a counterfeit California driver’s license, and a counterfeit Social Security card, which costs about $120 to $300. He encountered at least one hundred illegals during his career with voter registration cards who admitted they had voted in a U. S. election. With well over ten million illegals in the U. S. and so many buying up fake documents, there will almost certainly be a massive rush to claim health care benefits, especially with liberals looking to sign up illegals to “resist” against the Trump administration. “If nothing is done, Obamacare 2. 0 will contain the same verification provisions as the original version that have enabled illegal aliens engaging in identity fraud to access the subsidies,” Horowitz writes. It’s an insult to injury for Americans victimized by mass immigration policies and punishing healthcare regulations. Yet some Republicans seem eager to inflict more pain on the very voters who put them in power. Poll after poll shows Trump’s immigration policies prioritizing Americans, particularly struggling and vulnerable citizens, over foreigners are hugely popular with voters. Republicans in Congress ignore these voters and their pleas for affordable health care and immigration enforcement at their own peril.",0
20323,20323,Democrats See Opening in Tax Overhaul Fight: Trump’s Own Deductions - The New York Times,Alan Rappeport,"WASHINGTON  —   When Donald J. Trump was crafting his campaign tax plan last year, one of his top economic advisers proposed an idea that would have made it harder for real estate moguls to use mountains of debt to make deals. Mr. Trump, who made his fortune as a property developer and earned the nickname “the king of debt,” scoffed at the suggestion. “He hated that idea,” said Stephen Moore, the Heritage Foundation economist who counseled Mr. Trump during the campaign. The proposal to scale back interest deductions for companies did not make the cut. As President Trump focuses his attention on overhauling America’s tax code, he has considered turning to the other side of the aisle to reach a bipartisan deal. But an obstacle has already surfaced, dimming the chances that a “grand bargain” will be achieved: Democrats are sounding the alarm that reshaping the tax code presents Mr. Trump’s biggest conflict of interest yet. A tax code overhaul gives Democrats the chance to again bring up Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns and to press for details of how his business deals are financed. That focus could also affect which tax code items, such as interest deductibility, are included in the overhaul. “The American people want to see what this is about,” Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said of Mr. Trump’s presiding over tax code changes. “Are our interests being protected or are these deals that somehow promote his interests?” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said this week that tax code changes should be delayed until members of Congress can review Mr. Trump’s tax returns to see how an overhaul of the tax code might benefit him. And last week Terri A. Sewell, an Alabama Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, declared at a hearing that it was “imperative to know how such tax reform affects the president. ” Mr. Trump, as president, is legally exempt from the kinds of financial conflicts of interest that other government officials are required to avoid. But that has not stopped questions from swirling beyond Democrats about how he and his family could profit from the presidency. “If the tax reform proposals start to have discussions of whether or not to drop certain deductions for the real estate business, or to expand those, that now becomes the entire matter of tax reform,” said Richard Painter, who was President George W. Bush’s ethics lawyer. Referring to Mr. Trump, Mr. Painter added: “He cannot be an honest arbiter. ” Mr. Trump has proudly acknowledged that he fights to pay as little tax as possible so that the federal government cannot waste his money. While Mr. Trump’s advisers have said he would not release his tax documents, the financial disclosures and the portions of returns that have been revealed offer hints of his creative use of the tax code that will likely come up as debates over tax code changes intensify. A loss of nearly $1 billion that Mr. Trump booked in 1995, for instance, could have allowed him to avoid paying federal income tax for nearly two decades thanks to a rule that allows net operating losses to be carried forward into future years. Mr. Trump’s campaign tax plan did not call for changes to that provision. Tax provisions that have proved costly to Mr. Trump could be on the table. Last month, a portion of Mr. Trump’s 2005 tax return showed that he paid $31 million as a result of the alternative minimum tax that year. Mr. Trump has called for the elimination of that tax rule. The opportunity to use Mr. Trump as a weapon against a tax overhaul could distort the debate in other ways. After the fight over the “border adjustment” tax, the most contentious topic is the deductibility of net interest expenses, the idea Mr. Moore had unsuccessfully proposed to Mr. Trump. House Republicans, led by Speaker Paul D. Ryan, want to end the practice of allowing businesses to lower their tax bills by deducting interest from their incomes. Instead, companies would be able to immediately write off the costs of equipment expenses. This would generate more than $1 trillion in revenue  —   roughly the same amount as the border adjustment tax  —   according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group. “It’s been surprisingly less controversial so far than one would expect considering it’s a $1 trillion tax increase,” said Alan Cole, an economist at the foundation. That is quickly changing. New coalitions are forming to fight back against ending interest deductibility. Some Republicans from rural districts have expressed concern at congressional hearings this week about how scrapping interest deductibility would harm farmers who rely heavily on debt financing. Private equity and real estate lobbyists have also been aggressively mobilizing to resist the potential change. “This is the next large fight,” said James Maloney, vice president for public affairs at the American Investment Council, which lobbies for the private equity industry and considers the treatment of interest as its most pressing issue. So far Mr. Trump has avoided weighing in publicly on the finer details of the tax overhaul, but industries that could be affected by changes to the tax code hope to reap the benefits of having financial interests aligned with those of the president. Matthew Berger, vice president for tax at the National Multifamily Housing Council, an apartment industry group, warned that the tax outline being promoted by House Republicans could cause the tax burdens of real estate developers to spike, potentially dampening growth of new housing projects. But Mr. Berger said he was optimistic that Mr. Trump would not let that happen. “I would hope that his expertise in real estate would make him sensitive to the issues that developers consider,” Mr. Berger said.",0
20324,20324,THE END GAME closes in on the Clintons as the deep state turns… massive collection of criminally damning evidence about to be revealed that will bring down the Clinton crime family forever,Dave Hodges,"THE END GAME closes in on the Clintons as the deep state turns… massive collection of criminally damning evidence about to be revealed that will bring down the Clinton crime family forever 

by Mike Adams , the Health Ranger 
(NaturalNews) My fellow Americans, we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime. As of today, I am now convinced that the deep state has turned on Hillary Clinton and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the Clintons’ reign of terror over America and collapse her bid for the presidency. 
The mainstream media, of course, will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal Clinton cartel. As such, they will lie to the public to the bitter end, even as the Clinton Titanic sinks with all of them on board (in deep, frigid waters, no less, with no more lifeboats to be found). 
The so-called “deep state”— the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy — has decided Hillary Clinton is too damaged to defend any longer . Even if she were to win by stealing the election, she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survival. 
It has now been decided, I believe, that Hillary Clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the NSA and FBI. This will likely happen before the coming weekend. Once that is accomplished, the next goal will be to wait for President Trump to take office, then destroy the U.S. economy through a controlled, global debt collapse so that Trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies. (Remember: The deep state isn’t pro-Trump. They’re still all about defending the establishment. But Hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomach…) 
Instead of allowing Hillary Clinton to take power and destroy America from the top, in other words, deep state power brokers have reverted to “Plan B” which is to let Trump take the White House, then destroy America through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy. This is simpler than it sounds. Bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly $20 trillion in national debt isn’t exactly rocket science. All they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates. Monetary gravity will do the rest… 
In the mean time, Hillary Clinton and a long list of her co-conspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice , lying under oath, destruction of evidence, conspiracy, corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for many. 
The criminal racket of the Clintons is about to implode. The participants will be charged under the RICO Act for “racketeering” activities, for which ample evidence already exists. A new video from Steve Pieczenik describes some of this 
In this video, intelligence insider Steve Pieczenik lays out how high-level intelligence insiders are now working in concert to “reverse the Clinton coup” that’s attempting to take over America and destroy it from within. 
Even if you don’t believe Pieczenik — and I fully realize he’s controversial in his own way — this short video is a very important “must watch” explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing…“we’ve initiated a counter-coup…” 
The Clintons are going to go “full murder” in a last ditch, desperate effort to save themselves 
Beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days. Like a cornered wild animal, the Clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going “full murder” in an attempt to save themselves. 
I will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week. Watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes, swimming pool accidents or “natural” deaths involving people like James Comey, who’d better have armed security personnel around him at all times. 
Look for desperate measures such as the Clintons attempting to blackmail Obama, Comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins. We might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days, although that’s increasingly unlikely since it seems the Clintons are now on their own (they would need the assistance of Obama to pull off another Sandy Hook, you see). A deal has already been struck with Obama 
Most likely, deep state operatives have already struck a deal with Obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as Hillary Clinton’s head is served up on a platter. This likely explains why Obama is now publicly saying he trusts Comey (and refuses to go to bat for Hillary). There’s no love lost between Obama and the Clintons (remember 2008?). 
As all this is going down, the propaganda ministry of the Clinton regime — CNN, NYT, Washington Post, etc. — is going to explode into an all-out “bat-s##t crazy” conspiracy theory phase where they blame the Russians, extraterrestrials, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster for everything that’s imploding around the Clintons. Mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke. Maybe crop circles were created by the Russians as a secret code to Wikileaks and Donald Trump, eh? 
Meanwhile, conspiratorial operatives like George Stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition , so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put Hillary in the White House via any means at their disposal, including totally faking negative news against Donald Trump (which is, of course, the entire news mission of CNN at this point, a disgraced propaganda network run by anti-American traitors). If the vote is stolen for Hillary Clinton, all hell breaks loose 
Should the globalist Soros operators manage to steal the vote, bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place Hillary Clinton in the White House, all Hell breaks loose across America : 
• The FBI goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the Clinton criminal regime. 
• Donald Trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome, dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud, the rigging of voting machines, the attempted bribery of Electoral voters and so on. 
• The U.S. military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose Clinton and restore democracy. This one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated… (and yes, YOU will beg for a short-term military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose Clinton and restore open, fair and free elections). 
• Armed U.S. citizens prepare for a massive march on Washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite don’t get away with corruption, fraud and murder. Expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds. 
• The NSA likely goes into “full dump” mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against Hillary Clinton. This will likely be joined by CIA assets who already have the goods on the Clintons and their “Lolita Express” pedo joy rides. 
• Wikileaks, Anonymous and every former NSA analyst goes into “destroy the Clintons” mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the Clintons and anyone close to them. Anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help. (I expect Kim Dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well, as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward Hillary Clinton… as do we all, come to think of it.) 
• The establishment Republicans in the U.S. Congress will, as usual, meekly surrender to the democrats, pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because that’s what they do best when the going gets tough. Totally useless politicrats like John McCain can’t get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something. These useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of Washington as the revolution unfolds, replaced with individuals who actually honor the U.S. Constitution (like Rep. Louie Gohmert). I root for all groups working to save America and expose the criminal politicians 
Bring out the marshmallows and weiners, folks: This is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to U.S. history that anyone has witnessed in over 200 years. Try not to trip and “face plant” into the flames as all this unfolds. It might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready, since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get. (And thank God Hillary doesn’t have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes, or she’d probably launch them just to change the narrative…) 
As for me, I’m with anybody who’s trying to save America , restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison. Like almost everybody else, I’ve had enough of the lies, the corruption, the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in Washington D.C. who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much they’re universally despised. The revolution is ON. Anonymous, Wikileaks, Project Veritas, the FBI and the NSA have all been activated. There’s no stopping them now, and all the details of all the crimes of the Clintons are about to spill onto the stage of history, dirty deeds and all. 
Be warned, you are probably not psychologically prepared for the truth about what the Clintons really are. You will probably vomit.

20325,20325,Sandy Hook Promise Rakes In $6 Million (VIDEO),James Tracy,"in: False Flags , Gun Control , Multimedia , Propaganda , Sleuth Journal , Special Interests , US News Non-profit Headed Up By Career Marketers In the first two years of its existence the Sandy Hook massacre event’s premier fundraising organization has raised close to $6 million–an average of $3 million per year. In 2013 and 2014 alone the nonprofit pumped the American public and larger donors for $5,809,367, according to the most recent IRS filings of the organization. The lofty figure shouldn’t come as a surprise given the marketing talent heading up the organization and the fact that major news media have vigorously promoted the event without ever questioning its veracity. Tim Makris is Sandy Hook Promise’s full time Executive Director. Mr. Makris, who claims he had children attending Sandy Hook Elementary at the time of the December 14, 2012 incident, brings twenty years of marketing and public relations experience to the project. As Makris’ LinkedIn profile reveals, he developed his skills in the corporate sector at Thule Inc., Procter & Gamble, and Schering-Plough Health Care. Below is the performance of this savvy salesman at the inauguration of the Sandy Hook Promise money juggernaut. Here is another video pitch Makris made to the Brookings Institution, where he explains in no uncertain terms Sandy Hook Promise’s public relations strategy to reshape US gun laws. Sandy Hook Promise has close ties to the world of finance as well. The chairperson of its Board of Directors and another of its four corporate officers is Kristin Lemkau, Chief Marketing Officer of major global investment bank JPMorgan Chase. image credit: youtube And perhaps unsurprisingly Sandy Hook Promise is overseen by individuals representing the news media. The organization’s vice chair is Rob Cox , a founder and global editor of Reuters BreakingViews. News entrepreneur Rob Cox is a corporate officer of Sandy Hook Promise.

Within twenty-four hours of the massacre of twenty-six children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Cox and a circle of friends were working to found what would become Sandy Hook Promise, an organization dedicated to healing their own community and doing all it can to make sure others do not suffer the same fate. The degree of such caring is frankly difficult to comprehend. In other words, hours before Connecticut Medical Examiner H. Wayne Carver II stumbled through his press conference on December 15, 2012, explaining how parents were prohibited from viewing the bodies of their slain children, good-hearted souls like journalist Cox, professional marketer Makris, and banker Lemkau were scheming to cash in on the event. After all, this is what a community of like-minded souls is all about. James Belden the fourth and final Sandy Hook corporate officer. In addition to serving as a Newtown Commissioner, he also brings marketing experience to Sandy Hook Promise. Before funerals were even held for the deceased children or the results of a satisfactory crime scene investigation were close to completion Commissioner Belden was before television cameras promoting another non-profit, “Newtown United” and its promotion of “the underlying issues that caused this horrible incident–not just gun control but mental health and awareness.” Sandy Hook Promise is presently directing its marketing prowess toward leaning on US public schools to enforce certain mental health protocols on children; what it terms “mental health first aid” that will purportedly prevent “another Sandy Hook.” Sandy Hook Promise spokeswoman Nicole Hockley. Experienced marketers position the nonprofit to receive a large amount of “free publicity” via corporate news media. Sandy Hook Promise spokeswoman Nicole Hockley. Experienced marketers position the nonprofit to receive a large amount of “free publicity” via corporate news media. The millions solicited by Sandy Hook Promise thus far is merely a fraction of an estimated $130 million in federal funding and private donations brought in by Sandy Hook related charities. “The latest edition of the video We Need To Talk about Sandy Hook lists a total of $131,009,229 in grants and donations, including the $50 million for the new school,” academic researcher Vivian Lee notes , but this is only a partial accounting. Indeed, the total amount of money raised to date cannot easily be calculated.

20326,20326,Texas Dem Arrested for Alleged DWI after Safe Driving Seminar,Merrill Hope,"Dallas police arrested the Texas House Democrat voted “Freshman of the Year” late Tuesday night for driving while intoxicated. [Officers, responding to message that a vehicle hit a tree, later learned that the allegedly drunk driver was state Representative Victoria Neave ( ).  Reportedly, she did not cooperate with law enforcement who arrived on scene. The arrest warrant described Neave, 36, as having a strong odor of alcohol, unsteady, and with bloodshot eyes and slurred speech, WFAA reported. Officers also documented the state lawmaker’s behavior as uncooperative, refusing to perform field sobriety tests, and give breath or blood samples. According to police records, Neave repeatedly told officers in slurred speech: “I love you and I will fight for you and I’m invoking my Fifth Amendment rights. ” Officers booked her into the Dallas County Jail at 3:30 a. m. (CDT) on Wednesday where she remained, waiting to see a magistrate. However, on Wednesday, shortly before 2 p. m. Neave took to social media with a public Facebook apology. She stated: “Last night, I disappointed my family, my constituents, and my supporters. I disappointed myself. I’m deeply sorry. I’m so grateful that no one was hurt. I will accept full responsibility for my actions and I will work to make this right. ” Ironically, Neave participated in a   event promoting safe driving on Sunday, June 4. The often outspoken freshman representative has maintained a highly visible profile during the state’s 2017 legislative session. In April, she marched in Dallas against Texas sanctuary city legislation, Senate Bill 4, which Governor Abbott since signed into law. Breitbart Texas reported she tweeted: “Eleven years ago, I marched   family. This time, I march as a State Representative fighting   legislation at #txlege. ” A few weeks later, she led a hunger strike to oppose SB 4, asking other Democrat lawmakers and open border advocates to join her, as was reported by Breitbart Texas. She was also the organizer of the Dallas Women’s March and Texas House Democratic Caucus recently named her “Freshman of the Year. ” On Wednesday morning, Dallas County Democratic Party Chair Carol Donovan responded to the news of Neave’s arrest by issuing a statement: We understand, and are thankful, that no other person was involved or injured in the accident. Nevertheless, we look forward to speaking with her regarding the facts of her case and to insure she is alright. We wish her the very best and pray for her swift recovery so that she can resume her strong representation of the citizens of House District 107. Neave’s district encompasses East Dallas, Mesquite, and Garland. By trade, she is a lawyer with a practice in Dallas.

20327,20327,Places to Put Your Hands Together - The New York Times,Shivani Vora,"Whether the music to your ears is pop, classical, jazz, country or another type of tune altogether, the rhythms of 2017 have you covered. Dance the days and nights away at Summerfest, June 28 to July 9 in Milwaukee, an   bonanza that includes 800 acts spread out across 11 stages at Henry Maier Festival Park on Lake Michigan. The Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pink are among the headline performers this year, the festival’s 50th, but other genres such as   classic rock, Latin and reggae are also represented. The Monterey International Pop Festival, June 16 to 18 in Monterey, Calif. is also turning 50 this year, and celebrating in style, on the same weekend and at the same location  —   the Monterey County Fair and Events Center  —   where the original festival was held in 1967. That event helped establish the careers of many legendary musicians, including Jimi Hendrix, the Who and the Grateful Dead, and this year, over the course of three days, nine bands will take the stage to pay tribute to them. In Monte Carlo, it’s all jazz all the time at the 12th annual   Jazz Festival (November and December, exact dates to be determined) featuring performances by the world’s top jazz players such as Manu Katché, the drummer and singer, the bassist Richard Bona, and Ibrahim Maalouf, the trumpet player, all of whom were guests in 2016. The heart of the action takes place at the Opéra Garnier   an ornate   building, but the shows spill over into the Casino de   and glitzy oceanfront bars. Mellower sounds are in store on the Caribbean island of Mustique from Jan. 18 to Feb. 1, at the Mustique Blues Festival, a   secret among discerning fans. The event unfolds over nearly two weeks at the beachside Basil’s Bar, where spectators can sip sundowners while listening to the music of renowned blues players from around the world, including the San   guitarist and singer Joe Louis Walker. Festivalgoers should be on the lookout for other attendees, both famous and not, giving impromptu shows Mick Jagger and Michael Kors have jumped on stage in past years to belt out the blues before a stunned crowd. On the classical music scene, a prestigious orchestra celebrates a big birthday while another is born. In Austria, the Vienna Philharmonic is marking its 175th anniversary with more than 100 concerts throughout the year, including the free and   Summer Night Concert Schönbrunn on May 25, in the Baroque gardens of Vienna’s Schönbrunn Palace, and four opera productions at the Salzburg Festival in Salzburg from July 21 to Aug. 30, most notably “Aida,” in which the Russian superstar soprano Anna Netrebko will sing the title role. And in Germany, Hamburg anticipates a January opening for the Elbphilharmonie, a striking new building set atop a former warehouse, with a glass facade, a scalloped roofline and two concert halls. Festivities at the new cultural landmark will unfold all year, like the ¡Viva Beethoven! series, March 19 to 23, when the highly regarded Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel will conduct. In Montreal, traditional opera takes on a contemporary edge with “Another Brick in the Wall,” on select dates from March 11 to 24 the production honors the city’s 375th anniversary and is based on Pink Floyd’s 1979 album “The Wall.

There are stories of isolation and the destruction of love, and it promises to be   and emotional, just the way a captivating opera should be.",0
20328,20328,Lower Yields and Agropoisons: What is the Point of GM Mustard in India?,Colin Todhunter,"Email 
The decision whether to allow the commercialisation of the first genetically modified (GM) food crop (mustard) in India rumbles on. As I have previously discussed here, the bottom line is government collusion over GM crop technology (that is not wanted and not needed) with transnational agribusiness, which is trying to hide in the background. 
The real story behind GM mustard in India is that it presents the opportunity to make various herbicide tolerant (HT) mustard hybrids using India’s best germ plasm, which would be an irresistible money spinner for the developers and chemical manufacturers (Bayer-Monsanto). GM mustard is both a Trojan horse and based on a hoax. 
Various high-level reports (listed here) have advised against introducing GM food crops to India. Allowing for not one but three GMOs (which is what the GM mustard in question constitutes, when we include its two crucial GM parental lines) is according to campaigner Aruna Rodrigues a serious case of regulatory ‘sleight-of-hand’, permissible due to diluted rules to ensure easy compliance. 
If allowed to go through, India will be forced to accept a highly toxic and unsustainable technology suited to monocropping. HT GM crops would be particularly unsuitable for its agriculture given the large number of small farms growing a diverse range of crops alongside mustard that contribute towards agricultural biodiversity and, in turn, diverse, healthy diets. 
The processes being used to push through GM mustard are, according to this writ by Rodrigues, based on fraud and unremitting regulatory delinquency. She argues that the whole system is in addition being protected by a subterranean process of regulation that has also broken India’s constitutional safeguards by keeping the biosafety data hidden from the nation. 
Rodrigues says, “These matters require criminal prosecution.” 
New development 
The government has now told the Supreme Court (SC) that it won’t release GM mustard without the court’s say so. At the same time, however, it strongly opposes the writ filed by Rodrigues. 
In an affidavit response to Aruna Rodrigues’ writ, however, the Union of India revealed something that merited a press release from the civil organisation Navdanya and Aruna Rodrigues (presented in full below this article). 
According to the press statement, the government’s response contained an admission by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) itself that no claim had been made in any documents submitted to it that HT Mustard DMH 11 out-performs non-GMO hybrids. 
So then, what is the point of GM mustard? And what were all the claims being made in media about GM mustard outperforming non-GMO hybrids by 25-30% in yield? 
According to the press statement, that claim was also made by the developers (Dr Pental and his team at Delhi University) and is clearly recorded by the media. It also notes that the claim of superior yield was implied in the Supreme Court (SC) during a ‘hearing’ (24 October) on India’s import bill for edible oil. 
The press statement says: 
“It is now clear, by the GEAC’s own admission, that DMH 11 does not out-yield India’s best non-GMO cultivars and this includes hybrids against which this mustard was not tested.” 
Navdanya and Aruna Rodrigues ask: 
“Therefore, what is the Union of India’s point? Is this HT mustard being introduced because of its ability to just make hybrids? Given that it does not outperform our non-GMO hybrids, the argument collapses on its essential lack of science and reasoned thinking.” 
They conclude that this HT Mustard DMH 11 is not needed – which is in fact the first step of a risk assessment protocol for GM crops! 
HT mustard DMH 11 will make no impact on the domestic production of mustard oil, which was a major reason why it was being pushed in the first place. The argument was that GM mustard would increase productivity and this would help reduce imports of edible oils. Implicit in this was that India’s farmers were unproductive and GM would help overcome this. 
While it is clear that India’s imports of edible oils have indeed increased, this is not as a result of an underperforming home-grown sector. India essentially became a dumping ground for palm oil. Until the mid-1990s, India was virtually self-sufficient in edible oils. Then import tariffs were reduced, leading to an influx of cheap (subsidised) edible oil imports that domestic farmers could not compete with. 
This was a deliberate policy that effectively devastated the home-grown edible oils sector and served the interests of palm oil growers and US grain and agriculture commodity company Cargill, which helped write international trade rules to secure access to the Indian market on its terms. It therefore came as little surprise that in 2013 India’s then Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar accused US companies of derailing the nation’s oil seeds production programme. 
Supporters of GM twisted this situation to call for the introduction of GM mustard to increase productivity. 
Now their arguments on virtually each and every count have been shown to be erroneous and constitute little more than a cynical ruse to facilitate Bayer-Monsanto GM food crops and associated agropoisons entry into India. 
PRESS RELEASE 
UNION OF INDIA REPLY AFFIDAVIT 20/21 OCT 2016 
GEAC STATES: “NO CLAIM MADE THAT DMH 11 OUTPERFORMS NON-GMO HYBRIDS” 
“No such claim has been made in any of the submitted documents that DMH 11 out-performs Non-GMO hybrids. The comparison has only been made between hybrid DMH 11, NC (national Check) Varuna and the appropriate zonal checks — MSY of 2670 Kg/ha has been recorded over three years of BRL trials which is 28% and 37% more than the NC & ZC respectively”. (Ref. U of India Reply Pg 55 point 86-88) 
Petitioner Comment: 
With this statement, the Union of India effectively buries its own ‘raison d’être’ for its HT Mustard DMH 11. The following points may be noted: 
(a) The claim of a 25-30% increase in yield may not have technically been made in the SC. This adherence to a technicality is mischievous to the extreme, but much more moot is that the Regulators by this argument cut the grass from under their own feet. 
The above yield is indeed the claim by the Developers, clearly recorded by the Media and strangely in the SC by implication, by bringing in the issue of our import bill for edible oil in the ‘Hearing’ of the 24th. The claim is: 
· That the superior yield of this HT mustard DMH 11, (that despite there being NO TRAIT for YIELD in the Barnase-Barstar system with the Bar gene glufosinate), through its HYBRID-MAKING capability is superior to Non-GMO cultivars in the Country. 
(b) The Petitioners’ have proven without doubt based on RTI data that DMH 11 field trials were fraudulent, and specifically on the question of DELIBERATELY poor-yielding Comparators used in the field testing of HT Mustard DMH 11 in the BRL I & II field trials . 
NOTE: By this statement the Government concedes the argument that DMH 11 does not out-yield India’s best NON-GMO cultivars and this includes HYBRIDS against which this mustard was not tested in BRL I &II trials (2010-11 onwards). Therefore, what is the Union-of India’s point? Is this HT mustard being introduced because of its ability to JUST make HYBRIDS? Given that it does not outperform our Non-GMO hybrids, the argument collapses on its essential lack of science and reasoned thinking. 
CONCLUSION 
· This HT Mustard DMH 11 is NOT NEEDED (the first step of a risk assessment protocol for GM crops ) 
AND 
· This HT mustard DMH 11 will make no impact on DOMESTIC production of Mustard Oil leave alone the import oil bill of which mustard and Rape together are less than 2% of the total oil import (of 14.3 million Metric Tonnes in 2015-16)

20329,20329,Travel Ban Dampens Persian New Year Celebration - The New York Times,Jennifer Medina,"LOS ANGELES  —   As customers swarmed her small grocery store on Westwood Boulevard, Minoo Yousefi hurriedly set out more bunches of hyacinths and tulips. This was one of the busiest times of year, with Nowruz, the Persian New Year and celebration of the first day of spring, just days away. And as she had done for decades, Ms. Yousefi had already begun preparing the special dishes of herbed rice and lamb to serve her family. But this year something would be missing. Her mother and brother would not join the celebration. They are stuck in Iran, their visas  —   meant to bring them here in time for Nowruz festivities, which begin on Monday  —   canceled two days after the Trump administration’s initial travel ban went into effect at the end of January. They briefly considered trying again when the ban was lifted, but decided against it when they heard a new ban would come soon. For hundreds of   in Southern California, who traditionally travel back and forth to be with family for Nowruz,   plans and family gatherings have been disrupted because of uncertainty over the ban. Weddings that were scheduled around the holiday have been postponed, and elderly relatives are fearful they will never see their grandchildren again. For many members of the diaspora, this is the first time since arriving in the United States after the Iranian revolution of 1979 that they feel that they cannot risk leaving the country for fear they will not be allowed to return. “This is so sad, it’s just crazy,” Ms. Yousefi said. She has been here for 35 years and became a citizen decades ago. She has helped her mother, who is in her 90s, travel to Los Angeles almost a dozen times. “We don’t know what we will do,” she added. “My mother is old. She is going to pass away soon. My daughter may not be able to see her again, and that would kill her. This is supposed to be a time of celebration, but I am so anxious. ” The Los Angeles region has the largest Iranian diaspora in the world, with a population in the tens of thousands. With signs in Farsi on almost every storefront, a strip of Westwood Boulevard is officially deemed Persian Square, and residents sometimes refer to the city as Tehrangeles. The families here are close knit and represent a powerful sector politically and economically. They are part of one of the most educated immigrant groups, with many working in academia, medicine, real estate and technology. The population is diverse and complex though most are Democrat, there is a significant Jewish segment that supported Donald J. Trump, believing he would take a more   approach with the Iranian government. As   prepare to commemorate Nowruz, a widely celebrated ancient secular holiday that marks the spring equinox with elaborate symbolic spreads, or   the chatter has focused less on recipes and more on exchanging stories about thwarted travel plans and relatives stuck in limbo. Many fled Iran after the revolution, which ushered in the Islamic Republic, or during the   war with Iraq that followed. And for them, the travel ban is a frightening reminder of religious rule by the authoritarian government they left behind. “This is America, where we came for freedom,” Ms. Yousefi said. “We have mullahs in Iran. We do not need that here. ” A running joke among Iranians here is that when they arrived in the United States, they did not unpack their suitcases, because they planned to go back, believing that the religious government would grow moderate. But many are now raising a third generation of   children, and the ban feels like a stinging rebuke. While traveling back to Iran is costly, many Iranians in the United States consider themselves obligated to do so, not only to visit relatives but also to keep their children connected to Persian culture. Reluctant to give up on plans to someday return, some older residents have kept property in Iran. Mohebat Azimpour, 70, said he still maintained a life in Isfahan, in central Iran. He is a green card holder and had planned to go back this week to try to sell his house and to celebrate the holiday with his sisters. But he canceled his trip, worried that he would not be allowed back into the United States. He traveled from his home in Austin, Tex. to Los Angeles to visit his daughter and her family instead. “All my friends and family there were waiting for me to be there this New Year, but everyone agrees it’s best for me to wait,” Mr. Azimpour said. “I’m concerned that my retirement is in jeopardy if I don’t go back soon. I have so much at stake in Iran, I don’t have a choice. I have to go even if it’s hard. ” For the past two months, customers have come in distraught to see Farhad Besharati, who has owned the ATT Vacation travel agency in Persian Square for 25 years. Most of his clients are elderly green card holders who were horrified to see people like themselves detained in airports for days, he said. Roughly 70 percent of the flights he had booked for this month were canceled, he said. Fearful of losing repeat customers and feeling guilty that the flights were nonrefundable, Mr. Besharati returned their money anyway, losing more than $100, 000, he said. “They are all scared,” Mr. Besharati said. “They don’t want to get stuck. They don’t want their parents stuck here. ” He has been trying to reassure customers that it is safe to travel. But his advice has done little to quell their fears. “Even if you are following the news, you cannot understand what is happening,” he said. “They all worry they will never be able to see family members again, their homes again. ” Perhaps, Mr. Besharati said, it will calm down by the summer, another peak travel season to Iran. Not everyone is as optimistic. Typically, at least half of the nearly 250 Iranian graduate students at the University of California, Irvine, return home for Nowruz, but this year none of them are daring to leave campus, said Touraj Daryaee, a professor who runs the Center for Persian Studies there. He is organizing an international conference at the college scheduled for next year. But many of the scholars, including Iranians living in other countries, have said they are not willing to risk traveling to the United States. He is now considering moving the event to Canada. “People are all horrified with dismay, we thought that relationships were improving,” Professor Daryaee said. “Instead, we are all paranoid and scared. The student visas do not come with any promise of getting in again. ” Even   citizens are on edge. Farideh Farrohi, 69, had planned to go to Tehran with her son this month. But she and her son, who was born in Los Angeles and is a medical student, canceled their plans because he was worried about the current climate. Ms. Farrohi said she would go with or without him this summer. “What’s the worst that can happen to me  —   they insult me?” she said over lunch at a Persian cafe. “They have already insulted all of us with these absurd rules. ” The change in immigration and visa laws has altered the Nowruz celebrations in more subtle ways, too. Sahinaz Safari has been attending the Persian Alumni Association’s holiday events at Stanford University for years, which usually feature talks from successful entrepreneurs or cultural experts. This year, participants heard from the executive director of the Northern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, and information booths with immigration lawyers were set up. “It’s not just about culture,” Ms. Safari, an   graduate student, said. “It’s now also asking what we can do as a community, what we should be doing to take a risk and fight back. ”",0

EDITOR’S NOTE: Donald Trump made promises that a majority of the American people clearly identified with, one of which was his promise to #DrainTheSwamp . But draining the swamp involves removing the inhabitants of that swamp. Globalist Mitt Romney, keeper of the Bush Crime Family legacy, is one of the big frogs in that elitist swamp. So it stands to reason that Donald Trump could – under NO circumstances – choose Romney for any position in his cabinet. What do you think? Please comment below.

“I am struck by the intensity and volume of resistance [to Romney] from the grassroots; words like ‘betrayal,’” Conway said. “I communicate with PEOTUS and VPEOTUS privately and regularly so this is not an attempt to do so publicly as some (who missed the election completely) are suggesting.” 
She said she respects “completely” that these “weighty decisions” rest with Trump, “a man whose political instincts and unconventional campaign defied the critics and made history.” 
Some Trump supporters and allies have tried to steer the President-elect from nominating Romney as the U.S.’s chief diplomat. Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee, was highly critical of Trump during the campaign and called him a “phony,” and a “fraud” and dedicated an entire speech in March to denouncing his candidacy. 
“He attacked [Trump] on a personal level about his character, his integrity, his honor,” Trump supporter Mike Huckabee said on “Fox & Friends” Wednesday. The former Arkansas governor added that it would be a “real insult” to Trump voters if Romney was nominated to be secretary of State. 
Other Trump supporters, like former Speaker Newt Gingrich , have said they favor former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for the job.

“There has been an awakening, have you felt it?” TFA 
I can’t believe how much my worldview has shifted over the last year. Hailing from the radical Left, I have felt the pull of History in a new direction. I have become a critic of the social engineering that has been carried out since the 60’s; it has gone too far. Because of this over-reach, I have had to shift to defending the foundations of our society; community and family. On the hand, I will always be proud to have stood against the Empire and the ruling class Capitalists. The Right was very happy to stay quiet while the Financial-Military Empire raped the world, and we always told you these chickens would come home to roost. But now that they have, it is time to call a truce. 
I propose that we call a halt to the Culture Wars; this is the area where the Left is winning. I think we need to pause to assess the damage of this 50-year project anyway; the baby has almost been washed out of the bath. Then the patriotic Left (the anti-imperial/capitalist faction) and the Right can join against our common enemy. The division over social issues has been exploited by our enemy to prevent us joining on the political front. This must end, time for all People to come together against the evil which rules our world. 
The momentum is with the Right, so I am coming over to join my brothers and sisters to fight our common enemy. I am worried about playing with Nationalism, it has a very bloody history, and will put a lot of pressure on our minorities. They will try and turn our nationalism outwards, towards a fake external enemy. The enemy is inside the gates. If we all stand together and maintain our focus, there is nothing they can do. 
I am going to keep asking everybody to stop falling into the Left-Right trap. The patriotic-national Left and Right need to join, and anyone pushing social change during this war needs to see they are aiding the enemy. Once we are free, we can address the remaining social issues. A truce then, and all patriots rally to the banner. The Essential Saker: from the trenches of the emerging multipolar world $27.95",1

Throughout history it has been very apparent that there are generally three distinct classes of people; the poor, the less poor, and the very rich. The “middle class” is a phenomenon of recent centuries. No matter how much the government tries to subsection us, rename us, and create different social groups, it always falls back to these three main groups of people. 
Unfortunately, in this day and age, the middle class is disappearing and it seems that soon we may be looking at two social cultures; the extremely poor, and the extremely rich.

20335,20335,"Sparkling and Blighted, Convention Cities Spotlight Ignored Urban Issues - The New York Times",Sheryl Gay Stolberg,"CLEVELAND  —   It was a sparkling scene of urban renaissance: Children scampered through the fountain in Public Square, spruced up at a cost of $50 million just in time for the Republican convention here. Electricians installed security cameras on the redesigned plaza as carpenters put the finishing touches on a new cafe. Lex Horth, an amateur photographer from Gates Mills, an affluent village nearby, snapped photos and marveled at downtown’s newest jewel. “I haven’t come down here in 25 or 30 years because it was so derelict,” said Ms. Horth, 80, adding that she was blown away by “what Cleveland has done. ” Twenty minutes south, in a neighborhood called Slavic Village, Robert Smith and David Rajecki, both    disabled factory workers, surveyed a vastly different scene. Historically a bustling center of Czech and Polish immigrant life, Slavic Village was sliding into decay even before it was devastated by the  foreclosure crisis. Now many of its homes are boarded up. The barber on Fleet Avenue has bullet fragments in his leg rival gangs burst in last year and fired shots. Mr. Rajecki, missing teeth, cannot afford dentures. Mr. Smith calls the neighborhood “a dive”  —   “you don’t even got a bowling alley anymore,” he said  —   and Cleveland “a broke city. ” As Republicans gather in Cleveland to nominate Donald J. Trump for president, and Democrats in Philadelphia to nominate Hillary Clinton, the nation is in the thick of searing debates over terrorism, race and policing, gun violence and immigration. But the host cities, both in Rust Belt swing states, spotlight something Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton rarely discuss: the plight of urban America. Amid a widening gap between rich and poor, nothing screams income inequality louder than cities, including Cleveland and Philadelphia, case studies in renewal and gentrification, but also in crushing decline. And perhaps no Americans capture as well as those who live in and advocate for these cities the feeling that the nation’s present cannot match its past. In Washington last week, the National League of Cities released a report warning that “the promise of cities will be stifled” if issues like access to jobs, racial discrimination and gun violence were not addressed. In Philadelphia, Mayor Jim Kenney, a Democrat elected last year, wants “a comprehensive national program to bring our cities back. ” Here in Cleveland, Kurt Karakul, president of Third Federal Foundation, a nonprofit that works to improve Slavic Village, is furious at the attention paid to “bricks and mortar” investment downtown, while the neighborhood he is trying to help is so poor, he said, that every public school student qualifies for free or   lunch. “You talk about third world countries? We’re not that far behind here, with the circumstances that people have to live in,” said Mr. Karakul, a former lawyer. “And unfortunately, I don’t see much coming out of any of the campaigns on what we can do for poverty. ” Once symbols of American industrial might and prosperity, Cleveland and Philadelphia are among the poorest cities in the nation. In 2014, Philadelphia had the highest poverty rate (26 percent) among cities with more than a million people, while Cleveland has the   poverty rate (39. 2 percent) among cities with more than 100, 000 residents, according to census data analyzed by the Brookings Institution. Cleveland also has exceedingly high rates of “concentrated poverty”  —   poor people living in poor neighborhoods. Both cities have very segregated   populations, according to William H. Frey, a Brookings demographer. In both, there are tensions between blacks and police the Cleveland Police Department operates under a federal consent decree. Like other World War   manufacturing hubs  —   Pittsburgh, Detroit, Milwaukee, Baltimore and even Boston and New York  —   Philadelphia and Cleveland hollowed out during the latter half of the 20th century, losing jobs and people. Today, both cities rely on “eds and meds”  —   educational and medical institutions  —   as engines for jobs and growth. But while Boston and New York had started to rebound in the 1990s, Philadelphia and especially Cleveland have had slower rebirths. In 1950, Philadelphia was the nation’s   city, with a population of nearly 2. 1 million, and Cleveland was seventh, at about 915, 000. By 2010, Philadelphia was down to about 1. 5 million and Cleveland to fewer than 400, 000. Since then, Cleveland’s population has dropped more, while Philadelphia’s has ticked up  —   a sign of what Rolf Pendall, a scholar at the Urban Institute in Washington, called “a comeback story. ” But some see the comeback as overrated. “The conventioneers will come here, and they won’t get away from the stadium or the downtown  —   they’ll think they are in a comeback city,” said Ira Goldstein, who supervises research for Reinvestment Fund, a   nonprofit investor in community development. But he said other neighborhoods “have regressed over the last 10, 12 years. ” Sitting on a park bench in Rittenhouse Square, Richard Kahr, a retired real estate developer from Manhattan, said Philadelphia had “massively changed” since he arrived a decade ago. But he is troubled by “two classes” in the city, and the nation  —   “the people that like their life, and the people fighting for their life. ” Mantua, a proud but downtrodden West Philadelphia neighborhood whose rich   history is chronicled in colorful murals, is where those two classes may one day meet. Mantua is part of a “Promise Zone,” an Obama administration initiative to help poor communities. Nearly   of Mantua households have incomes below $25, 000 the typical home sells for between $10, 000 and $15, 000, Mr. Goldstein said. But Mantua also has a wealthy neighbor: Drexel University. Jimmy Allen, a retired teacher and 1960s street gang leader who functions as Mantua’s de facto mayor, knows its ills:   houses, drug addiction, struggling schools. And he knows its strengths: leaders with deep community roots. But what Mr. Allen, 68, frets most over are its vacant lots. Mantua is overrun with large grassy tracts where homes once stood many have been purchased by developers and speculators. Separately, John A. Fry, the Drexel president, has just unveiled an ambitious plan: a $3. 5 billion,   development of parks, businesses and   to be built over four decades, connecting the campus to 30th Street Station, the nearby railroad hub. A former management consultant, Mr. Fry has worked hard to enlist neighborhood support in 2014 Drexel opened a community center in a renovated mansion, with a computer lab and playground. Mr. Fry wants neighborhoods that surround Drexel to “become stronger and better versions of themselves”  —   a vision he says can coexist with his effort to “position Philadelphia as a place of enormous growth and development. ” Mr. Allen is unconvinced. He worries that speculators will move in, destroying the neighborhood’s character. “Drexel has a law department we can’t afford a lawyer,” he said. “So how are you going fight the dragon? You can only duck and dodge, and hope you survive. ” That tension over gentrification is the story of many old industrial cities here in Cleveland it is playing out in Ohio City, where lively restaurants and boutiques are attracting hipsters and millennials. Syrian, Lebanese and Egyptian vendors sell fruit and vegetables at the popular West Side Market there. “I take master’s degree in my country  —   now I sell fruit,” said Chrestina Sedrak, a former psychology teacher who fled Cairo during the 2011 uprising. While Ms. Sedrak sees opportunity, Narrin   52, who survived the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and arrived here in 1981, is less upbeat. The restaurants and shops are bringing in customers, but sales at her spice shop are flat customers look but do not buy. Eli Fletcher, 56, a musician who strolls the market in a caped crusader costume and calls himself “Guitar Man” (“I save Cleveland one song at a time”) can no longer afford to live in Ohio City, where he grew up, the son of a former coal miner who left West Virginia for Cleveland seeking factory work. “This whole gentrification thing forgets that this is a   city, and not some posh resort,” Mr. Fletcher said. As both cities look toward their moment in the spotlight, John Grabowski, a historian at Case Western Reserve University here, cautions against too much nostalgia cities, after all, are living things. Mr. Grabowski, editor of an encyclopedia of Cleveland history, grew up in Slavic Village. His boyhood home fell into disrepair after his family left, and was eventually burned. Today it is an empty lot. Returning there one recent afternoon, he could not help but grow misty. The old neighborhood where he played on the railroad tracks  —   “we used to grease the tracks and watch the wheels spin like crazy”  —   now resembles “empty spaces between somebody’s teeth. ” About 70, 000 people lived in Slavic Village at its peak the population is roughly 23, 000 now. “You have a housing stock that’s dysfunctional, a population that’s migrated out and an economy that’s flat,” said Tony Brancatelli, a city councilman. “Then you layer on the foreclosure crisis and it’s the kiss of death. ” Still, there are bright spots. The local bank Third Federal Savings and Loan  —   whose owners, descendants of Polish immigrants, started the foundation Mr. Karakul runs  —   is helping to build and finance new homes that sell for as much as $130, 000. On Fleet Avenue, a popcorn maker who sells his treats at the West Side Market is planning a new manufacturing plant. And on Broadway Avenue, in a   butcher shop, a maker of cured meat and sausage is moving in. Mr. Brancatelli, who sees the foreclosure crisis and its fallout as the root of “social unrest,” said the national conversation around “old industrial cities” like Cleveland had changed  —   for the worse. Eight years ago, when Barack Obama ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, they debated in Cleveland and their advisers participated in a forum on housing at City Hall. “Now we are not hearing a peep about it,” Mr. Brancatelli said. “It scares the heck out of me. ”",0
20336,20336,Alabama Governor Appoints Luther Strange to Replace AG Jeff Sessions in Senate - Breitbart,Neil W. McCabe,"The governor of Alabama appointed his own state’s Attorney General, Luther Strange, Thursday to fill the Senate seat left vacant by former senator Jeff Sessions taking over President Donald Trump’s Justice Department. [“This is truly a remarkable time in our state’s history,” said Gov. Robert Bentley, who came into office with Strange after the 2010 election. The two men worked together to forge the state’s 2015 $2 billion settlement with BP after that company’s massive 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Strange was chosen after the governor and the Alabama Republican Party Executive Committee spent 20 hours interviewing potential appointees, beginning in the fall after Trump announced Sessions was his choice for DOJ. “Alabama has surely been well represented by Senator Sessions, and I am confident Senator Strange will serve as a fine representative for our people,” the governor said. “His leadership on a national level, service as a statewide elected official, and long record of taking on tough federal issues are the very qualities that will make him a strong conservative Senator for Alabama. ” Senators confirmed their colleague to be U. S. Attorney General Wednesday evening,    with Sessions voting present and Sen. Joseph Manchin (D. . V.) crossing the aisle. Signing the Appointment letter for Alabama Senator Luther Strange.

Robert Bentley (@GovernorBentley) February 9, 2017,  Strange said he was thrilled to accept his new post. “I am greatly honored and humbled to accept the appointment to Alabama’s Senate seat vacated by Senator Jeff Sessions,” he said. “Senator Sessions’ commitment to public service is nearly unparalleled in Alabama history and his departure from the Senate leaves tremendous shoes to fill,” he said. “I pledge to the people of Alabama to continue the same level of leadership as Jeff Sessions in consistently fighting to protect and advance the conservative values we all care about. ” Strange said he is also looking forward to Sessions appreciating Alabama’s concerns as attorney general. “I am particularly grateful for the reprieve from federal overreach that states will surely be granted under Attorney General Sessions,” he said. “Throughout my six years in this office, I have wrestled with the Justice Department on an endless number of oppressive federal policies stemming from a total lack of constitutional deference and respect for the states. ,” he said. “I am confident that Jeff Sessions will do his part to restore the delicate balance between the states and the federal government that the Founders envisioned. ” The special election for the Senate seat is slated for 2018. Strange is expected to run in that election to keep the seat in his own right.",0
20337,20337,Megyn Kelly Soon To Be Out-Judge Jeanine Is In At Fox News,Dave Hodges,"

Although, as of this printing, nothing is official, but numerous rumors are swirling on New York City talk radio circles that F ox News is planning to replace Megyn Kelly with Justice Jeanine Pirro due to plummeting ratings and a total loss of credibility with Fox viewers.
Kelly’s most recent fall from grace came when Newt Gingrich eviscerated her on her own show over her biased coverage of Donald Trump’s alleged issues, while almost totally ignoring Hillary Clinton’s sociopathic and criminal behaviors.
This past Tuesday night on Fox News, host Megyn Kelly provoked Donald Trump supporter Newt Gingrich into a rage by insisting that Trump’s alleged history of sexual predation is a story worth covering. Gingrich, told Megyn Kelly that “ You are fascinated by sex and you don’t care about public policy. ” He followed up that outburst by demanding that Kelly repeat his words about Bill Clinton: “I want to hear you use the words, ‘ Bill Clinton, sexual predator .’ Say, ‘Bill Clinton, sexual predator. ’ ” Being that it was her show and she control the microphone, Kelly ended the interview ended with Kelly telling Gingrich, “ You can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them .” Fireworks on FAUX NEWS! Further, this shift accentuates the fact that Trump is leading Clinton by an overwhelming majority and Kelly has aligned with the losing side and it is going to cost her the coveted career that she has worked all of her life to obtain.
Since the Gingrich interview, Kelly’s already declining ratings, the result of her incessant Trump bashing, took a nose dive into the toilet and emptied out into the local sewer. Megyn Kelly is not likely to recover from the fact that she has been exposed as a Clinton supporter and denier of her crimes. Look for Judge Jeanine Pirro to take her place in the 9-10 PM Eastern time slot. Meanwhile, Sean Hannity’s ratings continue to climb for all the obvious reasons.
The Trump crowd has spoken, Megyn Kelly is on the wrong side of history.

20339,20339,Social Media Got You Down? Be More Like Beyoncé - The New York Times,Jenna Wortham,"In Gary Shteyngart’s 2010 novel, “Super Sad True Love Story,” characters carry around smart devices called äppäräts, which are something like iPhones on meth. The book is set in the near future. Staten Island is the new Brooklyn, and all the characters use their äppäräts to chat and shop and beam their lives out to the world, nonstop. Äppäräts are also equipped with a program called RateMe Plus, which constantly calculates (and broadcasts, of course) a status ranking based on users’ jobs, financials and online popularity, which is gauged by the quantity and quality of what they share.   the most intimate details of your life is the only way to get ahead  —   job promotions and romantic prospects depend on it. Shteyngart’s extrapolations from   social media are beginning to prove surprisingly prescient. The biggest companies are now slaving away to bring his vision ever closer to real ity. It’s not a philosophical or ideological statement on their part it’s just that their business model is predicated on sharing, and finding new ways to extricate more and more from us. This spring, Facebook introduced its 1. 7 billion users to a new feature called Live, which allows anyone to broadcast his or her life in a   stream to friends and family. The company also said it would prioritize personal posts like Live over those from brands or news organizations  —   a sign that, like Shteyngart, it thinks people are far more invested in voyeurism than in anything else. (And in theory, it should know.) In August, Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, followed suit with a feature called Stories, allowing users to post photos and videos that disappear after 24 hours. The company described it as a way to “share all the moments of your day, not just the ones you want to keep. ” It all feels like harmless fun, but our online lifestyles have begun to make a real impact in our offline worlds, a trend that doesn’t seem to be reversing. In 2014, Facebook talked with lenders about the possibility of linking profiles to credit scores, and one recent survey showed that 40 percent of   officers now say they peruse applicants’   profiles in addition to evaluating G. P. A.s and essays. Social media tends to reward those who share the most  —   which means we tend to see way more from certain people than we want to see. You probably already know what I mean, and have seen it in your own feeds, as friends,   and complete strangers faithfully transcribe their inner monologues in a   stream. Even those who make a living in the public eye aren’t immune to the perils of oversharing  —   on the contrary. Two recent examples come to mind: Jennifer Weiner, a very successful author by any measure (her 2002 book, “In Her Shoes,” was made into a movie starring Cameron Diaz) recently wrote an embarrassingly long diatribe on Facebook blasting Oprah for not selecting her latest novel for her book club and the rapper the Game has posted obscene,   selfies on Instagram that emphasize an enormous bulge in his underwear that may or may not be Photoshopped. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with either example  —   but they each clearly underline the ways that social media has stripped away our ability to tell what is O. K. to share and what is not. It’s not just that watching people vie for your attention can feel gross. It’s also that there’s a fine line between appearing savvy online and appearing desperate. In   contrast, let’s look at Beyoncé for a moment. Unless televised live performances count, she has never   a day in her life. She rarely gives interviews, so what we know is scraped from her   presence  —   which isn’t much. I can tell you what outfit and hairstyle Beyoncé posted on social media last week, but I couldn’t tell you where in the world she was, what the inside of her house looks like or even which continent her primary residence is on. Her images tend not to be   or even look as if they were taken with a cellphone. I couldn’t tell you who took the photos of her, because, unlike most celebrities, Beyoncé rarely posts selfies. I have no idea who comes to her pool parties, if she has a pool or has ever been to a pool party. I couldn’t guess what she wears to bed. And yet, when I speak about her, it’s as if we’ve been attached at the hip since birth. I feel, very intimately, that I know her. Beyoncé’s feed is the rice cake of celebrity   feeds: low in caloric content but mystifyingly satisfying. Most people treat social media like the stage for their own reality show, but Beyoncé treats her public persona more like a Barbie  —   she offers up images and little more, allowing people to project their own ideas, fantasies and narratives about her life onto it. Take, for example, her response after a video leaked of her sister, Solange, attacking Beyoncé’s husband, Jay Z, in a hotel elevator. Rather than posting   tweets explaining the whole thing, Beyoncé simply posted a series of photographs of herself and her sister having fun, quelling any rumors of a rift. This logic extends to her creative work too. Earlier this year, she spent an entire album, “Lemonade,” stoking rumors of marital strife with Jay Z. Lines like “You’re gonna lose your wife” seemed to confirm that her   relationship was on the rocks. The release of that album felt cathartic, an answer to questions about her personal life that her fans had been obsessing over for months. But then, before the fervor over that album faded, news of another album leaked: this time, a duet album. With her husband. In a single calendar year, Beyoncé managed to reveal what seemed to be a lifetime’s worth of secrets and pain, without it being clear whether she had revealed anything at all. If anything, that only made people want more. Conventional wisdom casts Beyoncé as a control freak, and perhaps she is, but control isn’t such a bad thing. Lately, I’ve been thinking about her bifurcated self in the context of   cyberfeminist theory. In the 1980s, academics believed that technology would introduce profound changes for humankind, especially women. Donna Haraway, emerita professor of the history of consciousness and feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and an inspiration for cyberfeminism, wrote that new technologies could liberate women from patriarchy and other oppressive systems. In the distant future, she believed, people could assume virtual bodies, allowing for “permanently partial identities” that could exist beyond gender, beyond reproach and without limits. The internet preserved many of the same biases and hierarchies Haraway so desperately hoped we could escape. And there are no true cyborgs yet. But social media has, in its own way, provided us a means of generating other selves. We just haven’t yet learned to set them free. Beyoncé has, in her own way. The Beyoncé we follow seems to live and breathe, and provokes a real emotional reaction. It’s an illusion that feels intimate and real, a hologram self for us to interact with that, in theory, provides the actual Beyoncé space to exist away from our prying eyes. This isn’t a strategy that works for only the incredibly rich and famous. I believe it’s a useful way of thinking about how we could all behave online. Why fret about oversharing, or undersharing, or to what extent our online selves are true to our ac tual self? We could instead use social media as a prism through which we can project only what we want others to see. We can save the rest for ourselves  —   our actual selves.",0
20340,20340,"Trump Couple, Now White House Employees, Can’t Escape Conflict Laws - The New York Times",Eric Lipton and Jesse Drucker,"WASHINGTON  —   The    team of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, now both senior federal government officials, has been alongside President Trump as the White House has hosted dozens of chief executives and a handful of world leaders in recent weeks. It is a rarefied crowd, one that has included the top executives of some of the world’s largest automobile, airline, chemical, pharmaceutical and tech companies. Mr. Kushner will continue to keep such select company now that he has helped create a new office that Mr. Trump is calling the White House Office of American Innovation. But the financial disclosure report released late Friday for Mr. Kushner, which shows that he and his wife still benefit financially from a real estate and investment empire worth as much as $740 million, makes clear that this most powerful Washington couple is walking on perilous legal and ethical ground, according to several prominent experts on the subject. Unlike Mr. Trump, who is exempt from conflict of interest laws, both Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump  —   who took a formal White House position this past week  —   are forbidden under federal criminal and civil law to take any action that might benefit their particular financial holdings. “Donald Trump can evade legal responsibility even if the conflicts of interest remain,” said Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit group. “His daughter and    don’t have that escape hatch. ” Mr. Kushner did resign from more than 200 positions in the partnerships and limited liability companies that make up the     real estate business. But the financial disclosure report shows that Mr. Kushner will remain a beneficiary of most of those same entities. Jamie Gorelick, who served as deputy attorney general at the Justice Department during the Clinton administration and is now advising Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump on government ethics issues, said that the couple could continue to hold on to so many of their assets because most of the value is tied up in buildings. “The real estate assets that Kushner is holding on to are unlikely to pose the kinds of conflicts that would trigger the need to divest,” Ms. Gorelick, a partner at WilmerHale, the law firm, said in a statement on Friday. “The remaining conflicts, from a practical perspective, are pretty narrow and very manageable. ” But real estate projects like the Kushner Companies’ deals have become a magnet for opaque foreign money  —   often from parts of the world that present thorny policy questions, such as China, where Mr. Kushner’s company has actively sought investors, as well as the Middle East and Russia. As part of his exceptionally broad portfolio in the White House, Mr. Kushner has been a crucial figure in arranging the visit of the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, on Thursday in Florida. The mystery behind many real estate investments involving foreigners prompted the Treasury Department last year to push for additional disclosures as a way to combat money laundering. While Mr. Kushner may face a potential ethical minefield, the disclosure form makes it difficult to determine exactly where those mines might be situated. The form, which runs 54 pages and lists hundreds of entities, reveals few details about the underlying investments that make up the Kushner empire, such as the addresses of buildings, sources of financing and names of partners. John Pudner, a conservative who has helped elect Tea Party candidates to Congress and now runs a nonprofit group called Take Back Our Republic, said that Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump, if they wanted to serve in the White House, would have been better off if they had taken the difficult step of liquidating their holdings. “A   for the president’s family and everyone else is if there were no question anytime a decision is made that it’s being done for the good of the country,” he said. The actions by Mr. Kushner stand in contrast to the moves by some other top aides to Mr. Trump, such as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, who before he was sworn in agreed to liquidate all of his stock holdings and his ownership stake in Exxon, putting his assets mostly into Treasury bonds and other permitted investments, such as diversified mutual funds, which make formal financial conflicts unlikely. Mr. Kushner, by contrast, continues to hold   lines of credit from institutions such as Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, while companies he is still a beneficiary of have billions of dollars in additional loans from heavily regulated institutions. Richard W. Painter, who served as a White House ethics lawyer in the Bush administration, said that Mr. Kushner’s financial holdings would complicate any interactions he might have with such banks. “The one thing Jared really ought to stay completely away from is anything having to do with ” Mr. Painter said, referring to the 2010 law that increased capital reserve requirements and instituted many other regulatory changes that affected the nation’s banks. Mr. Trump has already said he hopes to roll back the law, with the help of Congress and his top aides. Several of the companies that are in business with Kushner Companies have faced scrutiny by federal law enforcement. Deutsche Bank, for example, reached a $7. 2 billion settlement last year with the Justice Department over its sale of toxic mortgage securities. Mr. Kushner, who frequently speaks with world leaders and is tasked with overseeing Middle East peace negotiations, also has an unsecured line of credit worth as much as $5 million from Israel Discount Bank. Kushner Companies has also taken out at least four loans from Bank Hapoalim, Israel’s largest bank, though they are not disclosed in the filing. That firm is the subject of a Justice Department investigation into whether it helped wealthy Americans evade taxes with undeclared accounts. Another potential conflict rests in Ms. Trump’s continued stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, a project that has drawn protests from ethics experts who worry that people representing special interests could stay there or host events there to gain influence with the White House, which is just a few blocks away. Ms. Trump has rolled her fashion brand into the Ivanka M. Trump Business Trust, which is overseen by her    Josh Kushner, and    Nicole Meyer. The documents released on Friday valued the trust at more than $50 million. Discussions about changes in federal tax law  —   a major agenda item for Mr. Trump that could affect issues such as depreciation on Mr. Kushner’s buildings and clothing imported for Ms. Trump’s brand  —   could also pose problems, or force them to recuse themselves from participating. “They are going to have to walk a fine line between matters they are involved with financially and the policies they are helping create and legislation they may be advocating,” said Scott H. Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group. The federal ethics regulations formally prohibit federal employees from being involved in any “particular matter that will have a direct effect on a financial interest, if there is a close causal link between any decision or action to be taken in the matter and any expected effect of the matter on the financial interest. ” But Mr. Painter said that most administrations had interpreted the law more broadly, so that officials who own stakes in individual industries do not participate in even broad policy decisions affecting that sector, unless they seek a formal ethics waiver, as certain officials did during the first George Bush administration, given that they owned energy industry stocks and were participating in the decision to enter the war against Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait. Federal employees, under ethics rules that Mr. Trump imposed, are also prohibited, for at least two years after they arrive in the government, from working on particular matters that involve former employers or clients, even if these actions do not directly financially benefit the federal employee. The disclosures by Mr. Kushner and other White House officials released on Friday demonstrate just how complicated it is going to be to police these rules, given the vast and extremely complex financial assets not only within the Trump family but also among dozens of aides they have selected. The National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, as well as the top White House aides Christopher P. Liddell and Reed Cordish, collectively reported assets with a maximum value of more than $1 billion. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, reported assets worth as much as $53. 9 million. Even Mr. Bannon’s aide Julia Hahn, who is 25, reported investments worth between $1 million and $2. 1 million, according to a tally by The New York Times, while Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, had assets worth between $11 million and $44 million. Some of those financial holdings are already creating questions. Mr. Liddell, an assistant to the president and the director of strategic initiatives, has participated in White House meetings since January that involved several companies in which he continued at least through February to own stock in, including International Paper and General Motors. Mr. Bannon disclosed more than $500, 000 in income from entities linked to the hedge fund manager Robert Mercer and his daughter, Rebekah Mercer, major Republican donors who were crucial figures in Mr. Bannon’s appointment as the Trump campaign’s chief executive last year. Mr. Bannon is selling off some of these assets, his financial disclosure report says, including shares in Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm, and Breitbart News, the   website. But Mr. Bannon, even after joining the White House, has continued to interact with certain reporters at Breitbart, at times to express frustration with the site’s coverage of the White House or to discuss coverage, editors there have said. Even Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager, wrote a letter on Friday to the Office of Government Ethics saying he should not have made a supportive remark about a film, “The Lego Batman Movie,” that one of his companies helped produce. The comment was viewed by some as a commercial endorsement of the film. “The White House staff’s massive businesses are creating so many possible conflicts of interest it seems almost impossible for them to avoid running into trouble as they mix their former business interests with their new professional duties,” Mr. Bookbinder said.",0
20341,20341,Amazon Is Quietly Eliminating List Prices - The New York Times,David Streitfeld,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   In a major shift for online commerce, Amazon is quietly changing how it entices people to buy. The retailer built a reputation and hit $100 billion in annual revenue by offering deals. The first thing a potential customer saw was a bargain: how much an item was reduced from its list price. Now, in many cases, Amazon has dropped any mention of a list price. There is just one price. Take it or leave it. The new approach comes as discounts both online and offline have become the subject of dozens of consumer lawsuits for being much less than they seem. It is also occurring while Amazon is in the middle of an ambitious multiyear shift from a store selling one product at a time to a   ecosystem. Amazon wants to be so deeply embedded in a customer’s life that buying happens as naturally as breathing, and nearly as often. “When Amazon began 21 years ago, the strategy was to lose on every sale but make it up on volume,” said Larry Compeau, a Clarkson University professor of consumer studies. “It was building for the future, and the future has arrived. Amazon doesn’t have to seduce customers with a deal because they’re going to buy anyway. ” Or so Amazon hopes. Digital stores live by Alec Baldwin’s maxim in “Glengarry Glen Ross”: “Always be closing. ” The retailer has been experimenting with another method of closing a sale. It tells the potential buyer what the price used to be on Amazon. For example, Amazon originally promoted the Rave Turbo Chute as being discounted by 36 percent. Then, all mention of a discount was dropped and the   water slide was simply listed at $1, 573. 58, with an explanation that it used to be $1, 573. 59  —   one penny more. Then, it dropped the   price comparison. Then, it dropped the price to $1, 532. 01 and put the comparison back. “They still need to showcase deals, but the question is, How?” said Michael Kovarik, who runs a     called Rout. That is why stores love big discounts: they work. In studies by Mr. Compeau and others, the perception of a deal is often what makes the purchase happen. “We’ve been conditioned to buy only when things are on sale,” said Bonnie Patten, executive director of TruthInAdvertising. org, a consumer information site. “As a result, what many retailers have done is make sure everything is always on sale. Which means nothing is ever on sale. ” Amazon has both benefited from that conditioning as well as encouraged it, which is most likely why it is changing cautiously. It began eliminating list prices about two months ago, pricing specialists say, both on products it sold itself and those sold by other merchants on its site. The retailer did not return multiple requests for comment. “Our data suggests that list prices are going away,” said Guru Hariharan, chief executive of Boomerang Commerce, a retail analytics firm. Last spring, Boomerang compiled a list for The New York Times of 100 pet food products that Amazon said it was selling at a discount to a list price. Only about half of them still say that. “Amazon is a   company with very few sacred cows,” Mr. Hariharan said. “At the very least, it is conducting a storewide test about whether it should change its pricing strategy. ” With a majority of Amazon products, the presentation of a bargain used to be front and center. Take, for example, the Breville Infuser Espresso Machine. A few months ago, Amazon said this was an $800 machine that it was offering for $500, a discount of 38 percent. Two articles in The Times earlier this year on the problems with online list prices drew on a randomly assembled list of 47 discounted housewares, leisure and other products on Amazon, including the Breville Infuser. Over the Fourth of July weekend, the list price was gone for 39 of those products. The Infuser page, for instance, simply said what it would cost to buy at that moment, which was $483. Nineteen of the product pages tried to encourage a sale by pointing out that the price used to be higher on Amazon, although no time period was given. “Amazon is showing it can fix the problem if it wants to,” Ms. Patten said. The problem with list prices or, as they are sometimes called, manufacturers’ suggested retail prices, is that they are regularly more of a marketing concept than what anyone is actually charging. When Amazon was saying the list price of the Breville Infuser was $800, Breville itself was selling the machine for $500  —   about the same as Amazon. Other retailers sell it for $500, too. Breville confirmed the price was $500. Bargains online and offline that are not real bargains are breeding legal action, much of it using a tough California law against deceptive advertising. New cases have been filed in the last few months against Macy’s, J. Crew, Gymboree, Ann Taylor, Ralph Lauren and the website Wines ’Til Sold Out, according to TruthInAdvertising. org.   cases were filed in the first six months of 2016, nearly as many as the 25 in all of 2015. There have been at least 10 settlements. In April, a Los Angeles judge gave preliminary approval to a $6 million offer by Kohl’s Department Stores. That deal came on the heels of a $50 million preliminary settlement by J. C. Penney. Amazon itself was the target of a   suit  —   an unexpected development, because all Amazon customers agree to go to arbitration instead of court. A judge dismissed the complaint but the plaintiffs are now appealing, saying the arbitration clause is “unconscionable” and should be invalidated. Amazon declined to comment on the suit. The shift away from list prices is taking some merchants on Amazon by surprise. A seller named Travis complained in an Amazon forum that the list price on his product  —   which he did not identify  —   had disappeared from the site. “I’m well aware that it is bogus but it is a common marketing tactic that works very well at boosting sales,” he wrote. Amazon also appears to have stepped up its monitoring of a vendor system that allowed some sellers to insert data that listed their products as 99 percent or even 100 percent off. Another Amazon seller who complained that his list prices were not showing up said he was told by the retailer that it was routinely checking list prices on other sites. Mr. Kovarik of Rout said his analysis indicated that Amazon was regularly eliminating more list prices. “In early May, about 29 percent of the products we saw were missing list prices, but now the number is up to about 70 percent,” he said. Amazon has always focused on driving revenue while disregarding profits. That had many implications: It was driven to try new things it could undercut any competitor who focused on price it could literally buy customer loyalty. In Amazon’s third decade, with its complete domination of the   landscape, there are signs it is beginning to emphasize the value each customer brings. “They are trying to figure out what product categories have customers who are so tied into the Amazon ecosystem that list prices are no longer necessary,” Mr. Compeau, of Clarkson, said. In some categories, like groceries, Amazon seems to be using just one price, the    price. If Amazon brings the milk and music into your house, not to mention videos and   and the devices to consume them on, as well as a hot dinner and just about any other object you could want, that presents a pricing challenge of a different sort. Untangling what those deals are worth  —   as opposed to what they cost  —   is probably impossible. “Twenty years ago, we were hesitant to trust online companies with our credit card information,” Mr. Compeau observed. “Now we’re being asked to trust them completely. ”",0

By: Renee Nal | New Zeal Marxist birds of a feather… 
IOWA, do not vote until you read this! 
As revealed in Trevor Loudon’s film the Enemies Within , the democrat party has been compromised by subversive socialist groups, including labor unions, that seek to fundamentally transform America. While socialist Bernie Sanders did not win the democratic nomination for president, his surrogates are hard at work scheming to force as many socialists into office as possible. 
See the below list of socialists who are posing as Democrats in Iowa. 
Our Revolution, Brand New Congress (who has not yet announced their candidates) – and Berniecrats , a compilation of socialist candidates – are just a few of the socialist organizations focused on infusing local, state and federal government with socialists. Related to Iowa specifically, the local affiliates of the AFL-CIO and Americans for Democratic Action also endorse socialists running as democrats. 
There are many other subversive organizations providing funding and other support to radical left-wing candidates, such as Emily’s List , Human Rights Campaign and Council for a Livable World . 
Here is the list exclusively for Iowa, sorted by organization:* Tim Kacena , Iowa 14 State Representative 
Berniecrats (socialist candidates endorsed by Bernie Sanders, or have endorsed Bernie Sanders): Mason McCoy , State Representative, IA, 3rd District Timothy Kacena , State Representative, IA, 14th District Gary Kroeger , State Representative, IA, 60th District Teresa Meyer , State Representative, IA, 63rd District Joe Stutler , County Auditor, IA, Linn Co. Jason T. Lewis , County Supervisor, IA, Johnson Co. Rod Sullivan , County Supervisor, IA, Johnson Co. Kurt Friese , County Supervisor, IA, Johnson Co. Chris Schwartz , County Supervisor, IA, Black Hawk Co. Monica Vernon , U.S. House, Iowa 
*Note, many of these candidates are endorsed by – and receive funding and support by – multiple subversive organizations.

20344,20344,Blue State Blues: Trump’s First 100 Days in Historical Perspective - Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,"Next weekend, President Donald Trump will complete his first 100 days in the White House, a benchmark for presidential performance ever since Franklin Delano Roosevelt took office in the depths of the Great Depression. [Though there are several days left before the   mark, it is already possible to evaluate President Trump’s performance, and to compare him to his predecessors.  As I will argue in this column next week  —   with much news still to come before then  —   President Trump has had a remarkably active first 100 days. His major achievements have been in foreign policy and national security, where he has restored America’s military deterrent and reversed its international decline. He also appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, signed over a dozen laws repealing existing federal regulations, drastically reduced illegal immigration, and renewed economic confidence. In the face of unprecedented media opposition and Democratic “resistance,” Trump has endured some setbacks, notably the failure of the American Health Care Act, which was to have replaced Obamacare. But that effort will be revisited, along with tax reform, in the coming weeks. Absent major shocks, Trump has ample room to grow. The media disagree. CNN, among others, is declaring him a failure, claiming he has a “short list of accomplishments. ” Some historical context is in order. President Barack Obama did little of consequence in his first 100 days, aside from the   $862 billion stimulus and a failed executive order to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay. Yet the mainstream media were effusive in their praise, with Jonathan Alter of Newsweek trumpeting the White House line: “Barack Obama has put more points on the board than any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. ” Only Lyndon Johnson did more, he claimed. The media are often biased to favor Democratic presidents in this way, not only because of their political preference for Democrats, but also because of their ideological predilection for the idea of government “doing” something  —   putting “points on the board,” in Alter’s words, even if those “points” turn out to be useless or harmful. As such, Trump will never be given the same credit for repealing regulations that Obama was given for introducing them, for example. Until Trump, only Johnson and Ronald Reagan were considered effective in their first 100 days. As scholar William Lasser wrote in 2001, anticipating an embattled presidency for George W. Bush after the grueling Florida recount: Few of Roosevelt’s successors have been even moderately successful during their early days in office, at least in terms of legislative accomplishments. Harry Truman, who took office after Roosevelt’s death in April 1945, spent his first four months in office presiding over the last days of World War   a time to work with Congress on new legislation. Dwight D. Eisenhower initially focused on his campaign promise to end the war in Korea, and, despite having a   Congress, expended little effort on legislative matters. John Kennedy likewise focused on foreign policy, and had little real success on the domestic side. Nor were Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George [H. W.] Bush, or Bill Clinton spectacularly successful in their first few months in office. Inexperience and disarray have also made several past presidents susceptible to rookie mistakes during the first 100 days. Jack Kennedy authorized the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, for example, in April 1961. Bill Clinton’s early mistakes doomed his health care plan, while Jimmy Carter’s missteps greatly damaged his relationship with Congress and the federal bureaucracy. The exceptions to the rule of ineffectiveness might be Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan. Johnson capitalized on his own legislative experience and the national trauma following the assassination of Jack Kennedy to push through the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and a major antipoverty measure. Then he built on his landslide reelection victory in November 1964 to win approval of the Voting Rights Act, Medicare, and a massive increase in federal aid to education. Reagan, who took office amidst high unemployment and high inflation and after a   hostage crisis in Iran, likewise acted quickly in 1981 to win congressional victories on tax and spending cuts (along with increases in military expenditures). Trump has not passed major legislation in his first 100 days  —   but neither did Obama. Obamacare and   would not be passed until 2010. Arguably, the most important thing that happened in Obama’s first 100 days was that the stock market hit rock bottom. Shortly after Obama’s first 100 days, the Federal Reserve released optimistic results from its “stress tests” of U. S. banks, which helped the economic recovery  —   though it was the slowest since WWII. Trump’s first 100 days have been far more consequential. His approval ratings are low by historical standards  —   thanks largely to hostile media  —   and he may yet struggle to pass his legislative agenda. Like Obama, Trump has energized his opponents. His own supporters worry he will stray from his promises. And Congress (unexpectedly) and the courts (predictably) have frustrated him. Yet measured against his predecessors, Trump’s first 100 days place him in league with Reagan and Johnson, for sheer impact. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

20345,20345,DeepStateGate: Trump Ends the Wiretapping Innuendo Game by Dealing Himself In - Breitbart,John Hayward,"The White House statement on “DeepStateGate”  —   President Donald Trump’s allegations that former President Barack Obama ordered surveillance on him during his 2016 presidential campaign  —   has the feel of cards and chips thumping down on the table:[White House calls for probe into whether Obama abused executive powers in 2016 https:  .  pic. twitter.   —   NBC News (@NBCNews) March 5, 2017,   The White House is placing a substantial bet on what Congress will uncover. Don’t expect those cards to be dealt swiftly because such investigations take time. The Obama administration was highly adept at stalling investigations until the Democratic media could pronounce them “old news” and ignore the outcome.  The Trump administration can distinguish itself by cooperating energetically with this one and helping it move forward quickly. Rest assured that no matter how long it takes, the media will never consider it “old news” as long as there remains any chance for anyone connected with the Trump 2016 campaign to get in trouble over contacts with the Russians. It’s possible one reason Trump issued his explosive tweets on surveillance was to make everyone put up or shut up. That might already be working, as some of the more aggressive dealers in unsubstantiated innuendo are suddenly admitting they don’t have any actual evidence. There can’t be any hard evidence if Trump is   wrong about Obama administration surveillance: Chris Coons walkback: “I have no hard evidence of collusion” between Trump world and Russians https:  .   —   Legal Insurrection (@LegInsurrection) March 5, 2017,  Until now, Democrats and their media have been pleased to create the impression that all kinds of wiretapping operations were conducted against the Trump campaign, uncovering many scandalous, possibly illegal connections. Only by reading those articles carefully does one discover the sources are highly speculative and the evidence is thin at best. The   New York Times piece from January 19 is a perfect example of this. It begins by    confirming the existence of the wiretaps everyone in Obamaworld is now swearing are a figment of Donald Trump’s imagination. Mountains of innuendo about connections between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence have been spun out of what these abruptly   intercepts contained, according to the anonymous leakers who currently drive almost 100 percent of mainstream media coverage.  But if you read that New York Times article carefully, it admits the communications intercepts may not exist, and if they do, no one can confirm what they actually say (emphasis added): American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of   Donald J. Trump, including his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, current and former senior American officials said. The continuing counterintelligence investigation means that Mr. Trump will take the oath of office on Friday with his associates under investigation and after the intelligence agencies concluded that the Russian government had worked to help elect him. As president, Mr. Trump will oversee those agencies and have the authority to redirect or stop at least some of these efforts. It is not clear whether the intercepted communications had anything to do with Mr. Trump’s campaign, or Mr. Trump himself. It is also unclear whether the inquiry has anything to do with an investigation into the hacking of the Democratic National Committee’s computers and other attempts to disrupt the elections in November. The American government has concluded that the Russian government was responsible for a broad computer hacking campaign, including the operation against the D. N. C. Whatever President Trump’s intentions were in using Twitter to touch off this firestorm, one of the immediate effects has been letting the gas out of all those speculative Trump stories. The Democratic media is now furiously working to prove all of its own previous coverage of the   allegations was little more than idle speculation, every bit as lacking in hard evidence as Trump’s accusation that Obama was tapping his phones.  After months of unfounded allegations and badly sourced speculation intended to cripple his administration, maybe Trump wanted to prove that only one side of the partisan divide is permitted to make “wild allegations. ” Obama’s plants in the Deep State can leak whatever they please, law and truth be damned. They can get an avalanche of hostile coverage moving with a few phone calls or emails. The media feels no contrition when the story turns out to be exaggerated or completely false, eagerly turning to the same Obama holdovers as sources for the next big phony scoop. No one on Trump’s team, including the president himself, is allowed to reciprocate in kind. We are meant to feel bottomless outrage that Trump would level unsubstantiated allegations against Obama, but apparently, Obama’s minions can launch a constant barrage of unsubstantiated allegations against Trump.  Intentionally or accidentally, Trump just forced the press to admit how weak the bulk of those allegations were. The wiretapping timeline that has drawn so much attention since Saturday night was largely based on mainstream media reporting. The media is effectively saying, “Hey, wait, we were just blowing smoke. We didn’t think anyone would take those reports seriously and build a case that Obama was wiretapping Trump. We just wanted to make Trump look bad by pumping up vague rumors that he and his campaign might have been under observation!” Amazingly, the same media that just went through 48 hours of convulsions over a bogus “perjury” charge against Attorney General Jeff Sessions is happy to cite an actual, admitted perjurer, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, as an unimpeachable source on the exact issue he lied about to Congress. They also expect the American people to trust former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes, who openly bragged of his ability to mislead credulous reporters and construct phony narratives to sell the Iran nuclear deal.  The Obama administration’s enthusiasm for surveillance and using government power against its political enemies is a matter of shameful record. The    “Resistance” mindset among Democrats is painfully obvious. If they are running a “silent coup” against Trump, it’s the loudest silent coup in history. You can scarcely sleep at night over the racket this silent coup makes.  Sorry, DNC Media, no sale. In the absence of hard evidence one way or the other, Team Obama is not going to win a credibility shootout with Team Trump.  One of the best and most   observers of the wiretapping drama is Andy McCarthy, who writes for the decidedly   National Review. McCarthy’s Sunday post on the matter is well worth reading in full. His key point is that some highly unusual FISA requests for surveillance on the Trump campaign were made and were denied by the court, as very few such requests are. The Obama administration was persistent and eventually obtained the authorization it wanted, but there is reason to suspect it was not entirely candid with the FISA court on its final, successful request. McCarthy points out that if Obama believed half of what the Democrats tout as sacred truth about the Russians working with Trump’s campaign, he would have been negligent not to authorize the kind of surveillance Trump is angry about, and there is “a less than zero chance” surveillance could have been imposed “without consultation between the Justice Department and the White House. ” Robert Barnes at LawNewz also explores the idea of the FISA court approving a warrant that was submitted without Trump’s name but “which Obama then misused to spy on Trump and many connected to Trump. ” He suggests the most serious legal jeopardy that might be facing the people involved in such an effort would be perjury for lying to the FISA court and the dissemination of collected intelligence that should have been kept tightly classified. Instead, he cites reports that Obama acted to reduce the restrictions on sharing this information and to preserve material that should have been destroyed. What McCarthy and Barnes are describing is plausible and consistent with the behavior of the Obama administration over many years. That doesn’t mean it’s automatically true, but it should be investigated, every bit as thoroughly as Russian activity in the 2016 election cycle. Trump’s weekend tweets may have finally put an end to speculative reporting, strategic leaking, and innuendo. Perhaps the only way to end that game was for Trump to deal himself in.",0

20347,20347,Mormons’ Distaste for Donald Trump Puts Utah Up for Grabs - The New York Times,Alan Rappeport,"SALT LAKE CITY  —   Donald J. Trump has vowed to turn blue states red in November, but as he continues to rattle Republicans with his combative style and provocative proposals, voters in some of the country’s most conservative strongholds are considering a radical idea: supporting Hillary Clinton. The dilemma posed by this year’s choice of candidates is perhaps most apparent here in Utah, a mountain state that has not backed a Democrat for president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. More than 50 years later, a large Mormon population with a strong distaste for Mr. Trump has left the state up for grabs, and with a substantial Mormon presence spilling into places such as Arizona, Idaho and Nevada, what would normally be a Republican safe zone could be surprisingly competitive. With the Clinton campaign looking to put   states in play, the decision for many Mormon voters in Utah has become agonizing as they digest Mr. Trump’s stances toward Muslims in light of their own history as an   religion, and as his “America First” message repels   Mormons who travel the world on missions and who welcome refugees. “People who normally vote Republican are in a terrible state of ambivalence right now,” said Tim Chambless, a political scientist at the University of Utah. “They are so undecided. They want to vote, but they aren’t sure how to vote. ” The first signs of Mr. Trump’s troubles in Utah date to early March, when Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and a Mormon who is beloved in the state, gave a speech here warning that Americans were being duped by Mr. Trump. Later that month, Mr. Trump was throttled by Senator Ted Cruz in the state’s caucuses, winning a paltry 14 percent of the vote. In June, two polls showed Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton deadlocked in Utah, making it increasingly plausible that its six electoral votes are really in play. With three months until the election, the Clinton campaign is now considering a possible upset in Utah, the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is aggressively wooing disenchanted Republicans, and on Monday word came that Evan McMullin, a Mormon who is a former C. I. A. official opposed to Mr. Trump, was entering the race. Voters such as Angie Melton, who has never voted for a Democrat, are feeling deeply torn. “I’m upset by this turn of events,” Ms. Melton, 41, said as she sat in the shade with her family next to the towering Salt Lake Temple, the center of Mormonism. “I’ve always voted Republican, but my thought has been that she would be less damaging in terms of world politics,” she said, referring to Mrs. Clinton. “It doesn’t mean that I agree with much of anything she says or her as a person,” Ms. Melton added, “but I would rather that she win. ” Such   is common as trepidations about Mr. Trump grow. On substance and style, he evokes an antipathy among many Mormons that is rooted in culture, religion and history. For a religious group that was driven to Utah during the 19th century in the face of persecution, Mr. Trump’s calls for religious tests and a ban on Muslim migration echo a painful past, leaving some wondering if they will be next. “The issue of religious liberty is an important one in the state, and the notion of a religious test for immigration raises deep concerns,” said Chris Karpowitz, a director of Brigham Young University’s Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy. “Mormons are sensitive to issues like this because of their own history. ” Joseph Smith founded the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints in upstate New York in 1830. Converts, however, were often targeted as heretics for practicing polygamy, believing in scriptures exclusive to Mormonism and saying that their faith was the true restoration of Christianity. Most Mormons were Democrats in the 19th century, Professor Karpowitz notes, because of Republican opposition to polygamy, but they started to move to the right in the 20th century. By the time the 2012 presidential election came around, with Mr. Romney as the candidate, 90 percent of Utah’s Mormons voted Republican. That number is expected to drop significantly this year with Mr. Trump atop the ticket. His shifting positions on social issues, his   views on immigration and his flashy lifestyle clash with Mormon sensibilities that prize humility and charity. And there is his stance against taking in refugees from abroad. “His rhetoric and the church’s rhetoric on refugees could not be more different,” said J. Quin Monson, an author of “Seeking the Promised Land: Mormons and American Politics. ” Mr. Trump’s ascendance has also divided Utah’s lawmakers, with some reluctantly saying they will support the nominee and others showing resistance. Among the holdouts is Senator Mike Lee, a Mormon whose opposition to Mr. Trump stalled in a floor fight at the Republican convention last month. He articulated in a June interview why the candidate was unpopular, pointing to statements that he said reflected religious intolerance. “My state consists of members who were a religious minority church  —   a people who were ordered exterminated by the governor of Missouri in 1839, and statements like that make them nervous,” Mr. Lee said. Facing a tough   fight against a Democrat, Representative Mia Love, a rising Republican star, skipped the party’s convention in Cleveland and gave up her role as a delegate. She has not said if she will vote for Mr. Trump. There have even been some defections. Mark Madsen, a Republican state senator who did attend the convention as a delegate, abandoned the party in frustration in late July and became a Libertarian. Mr. Madsen, who is Mormon, said he thought he was being   into supporting Mr. Trump. “It’s hard to figure out where he is on issues because he’s all over the place,” Mr. Madsen said. “I think he’s frankly boorish and banal. ” Sensing opportunity in the air, Mr. Trump’s opponents are watching Utah closely. The state has a strong libertarian streak, and Mr. Johnson, whose campaign headquarters is in Salt Lake City, has been returning regularly in hopes that he can capitalize on dissatisfaction with Mr. Trump. That he was governor in nearby New Mexico could help his cause, although if he siphons votes away from Mr. Trump, it could benefit Mrs. Clinton. Democrats are also taking Utah seriously. While they realize that their improved chances in the state are not because their nominee has suddenly surged in popularity, the party would be happy to break its losing streak. “This is the first time since the   that a Democratic presidential candidate could win in Utah,” said Peter Corroon, the party’s chairman in the state. “Unfortunately, it’s not because of the Democrat, it’s because of the Republican. ” Nonetheless, the Clinton campaign has staff on the ground in Utah, and it is dispatching former President Bill Clinton to the state for a   event this week. The campaign would not say if Mrs. Clinton would make a trip of her own, but the possibility remains. “There is no doubt that Donald Trump’s offensive rhetoric has made Utah more competitive than before, and we will continue to assess our options in the state,” said Marlon Marshall, the Clinton campaign’s director of state campaigns and political engagement. Young Republican Mormons such as Mary Weidman give Democrats hope. Sitting outside a soda shop in Provo, Ms. Weidman explained that after supporting Mr. Romney four years ago, she would vote for Mrs. Clinton in November. “I think it’s the lesser of two evils,” Ms. Weidman, 27, said, expressing dismay over how Mr. Trump talks about women. “When you think of a leader, he lacks every trait. ” Despite such sentiments, it is risky to count Republicans out. While the Trump campaign had no comment about its strategy, the state Republican Party said that Mr. Trump’s team was up and running in Utah. Longtime conservatives who say they are thinking about voting for Mrs. Clinton could have second thoughts on Election Day. “Republicans at this point are a little unhappy with Trump, but they’re going to vote for him,” said James Evans, the chairman of the state party. That appeared to be the case for Nathan Alder, a    Republican Mormon who goes to Utah Valley University in Orem. “I don’t like Trump, but I probably will vote for him,” Mr. Alder said, explaining that his worries about what he considers Mrs. Clinton’s liberal views narrowly outweighed his fears about Mr. Trump’s temperament. “I am pretty torn. I’m not going to lie. ”",0

20351,20351,Oklahoma Man Is Charged With Killing Lebanese-American Neighbor - The New York Times,Christine Hauser,"He called the family “dirty Arabs” and tried to run over the mother with a car, the authorities said. An Oklahoma man’s animosity toward the   family living next door, according to court records, took a fatal turn this month when he shot one of the sons on the porch of their house in Tulsa. The man, Vernon Majors, 61, was charged Tuesday with   murder in the killing of his neighbor, Khalid Jabara, 37, on Aug. 12, according to a statement by the district attorney, Steve Kunzweiler. Mr. Majors, who had recently been released on bond after being suspected of hitting Mr. Jabara’s mother with a car, was also charged with possession of a firearm by a felon, threatening an act of violence and malicious intimidation or harassment  —   the last count a misdemeanor reflecting the years of racism and violence that the authorities say has pervaded the stretch of grass connecting their yards. Rebecca   a friend who is serving as a spokeswoman for the Jabara family, said Mr. Jabara’s death had devastated the   Lebanese community in Tulsa. “From a larger community’s perspective, what they see is a    man shot and killed by a man who called them ‘dirty Arab,’” Ms.   said in a telephone interview. “There is no nuance. When people are using ethnic and racial slurs, this isn’t just people being sensitive about it, but that they should be taken seriously. ” Marvin Lizama, Mr. Majors’s lawyer for the earlier case, said in an email on Tuesday that he had no comment on the new charges. St. Antony Orthodox Christian Church, where Mr. Jabara’s funeral was held last Thursday, posted a smiling photograph of him  on its website, mourning the “tragedy” of his killing. “Those of us at St. Antony will always remember the young man who grew up in our parish,” the announcement said. “Khalid had a huge heart. ” The     Committee said that Mr. Jabara was clearly targeted because of his ethnicity. “The unfortunate murder of Jabara is a reflection of the impact and power of hateful rhetoric in politics and the society at large,” the group said, adding that allowing such to continue “will lead to additional hate crimes against minority and immigrant communities. ” News of Mr. Jabara’s death found a home on social media with the trending #justice4khalid, where it was given broader context within the national discussion on race and violence. Nearly 3. 6 million Americans trace their roots to an Arab country, many with ancestral ties to Lebanon, according to the Arab American Institute. While Oklahoma is not among the states with large   populations, it does have a     community in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, Ms.   a lawyer and former employee of the institute, said. Like others in Tulsa, the Jabara family, who are Orthodox Christians, can trace their roots back to a village in southern Lebanon called Marjayoun, which families fled to escape war. Mr. Jabara’s parents moved with Khalid and his older sister Victoria in 1983 and settled in the United States, where his younger brother Rami was born, Ms.   said. While his siblings have moved away, Mr. Jabara had stayed to help with his parents’ catering business and medical care. “Khalid’s heart was big,” his sister Victoria Jabara Williams said in a Facebook post. “He cared for our entire family, our friends and people he didn’t even know. ” Mr. Majors, also known as Stanley Vernon Majors, moved next door to the Jabara family in 2011, Ms.   said. While it was not immediately clear when the troubles started, family and court records document a history of animosity and of calls to the police to report racial slurs, harassment and threats by Mr. Majors. In 2013, Mr. Jabara’s mother, Haifa, took out a protective order against Mr. Majors, which court records show that he violated. In September 2015, Mr. Majors rammed Ms. Jabara with his car, and he was charged with assault and battery, according to the documents. Ms. Jabara had broken bones and a collapsed lung, the family said. In May 2016, the district attorney’s office tried to keep Mr. Majors in jail to await trial, citing his “wanton disregard for the life of the victim and the safety of the public. ” Mr. Majors, however, was able to make bail and was released. According to the police and Ms.   Mr. Jabara was home with his father on Aug. 12 when he called the police out of fear of Mr. Majors. Officer Leland Ashley said the police received a call from the Jabara house saying that Mr. Majors had banged on a window. Ms. Williams said her brother had called the police to report that Mr. Majors had a gun. The police responded but left without taking any action. Then, just before 7 p. m. Officer Ashley said, a neighbor reported that there had been a shooting. Mr. Jabara was taken to the hospital, where he died of his wounds. Mr. Majors was arrested, hiding near a library, about 11 p. m. the officer said. Mr. Kunzweiler, the district attorney, said in an emailed statement before announcing the charges that the family “did everything they were supposed to do and the system failed them. ” Ms. Williams said her family had lived “in fear of this man and his hatred for years. ” “He should not have been released without monitoring,” she wrote. “Yet he was released and put back next door to us, the family he assaulted just months before. This is troubling at any time, but profoundly disturbing given the current climate of our country and the increase nationally in cases of hate crimes. ”",0
20352,20352,EU Politicians are Convinced that Tanks are the Best Remedy for Social Disparity | New Eastern Outlook,Author,"Region: Europe Following in the wake of the White House policy, European poli tical elites have been stepping up their groundless propagandistic rhetoric about the growing military threat of Russia, Iran, China, which is aimed at achieving further militarization of Europe at the expense of t he social benefits of its citizens. In his recent speech at an event hosted by the German Marshall Fund of the United States, NATO ‘s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced that he expects a 3% real increase in defence spending in Europe and Canada, however, he added, other than the US , only four NATO members are currently spending 2% of GDP on defence . Against the background of a string of upcoming election campaigns in the EU, it’s really not that hard to predict how Europeans are going to take the announcement that their governments are planning to increase their military budgets. The most likely scenario is that a number of EU states will vote for their own version of Trumpxit, which means that an outsider candidate will have more chances that those from the ruling elites. As the living conditions of an ever increasing number of Europeans continue to deteriorate, it’s highly unlikely that EU citizens are going to tolerate new military expenditures . The data provided by the Eurostat shows that i n 2015, around 25 million children, or 26.9% of the population aged 0 to 17, in the European Union were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. A total of six member states saw a third of all children being at risk of poverty or social exclusion, these are Romania (46.8%), Bulgaria (43.7%), Greece (37.8%), Hungary (36.1%), Spain (34.4%) and Italy (33.5%). According to the Guardian, having a child while living in a rental accommodation has become unaffordable for young families in two - thirds of the UK. The most inaccessible place for those wanting to start a family was London, with a two-bedroom rental there costing 60% of the average income for someone in their 20 s and 44% for someone in their 30 s . This was followed by the south-east, south-west and the east. At the same time, the number of families with children living in emergency accommodations in England rose by 45% in the last 12 months, reaching the highest level in 12 years . In turn, the Fabian Society says the Tory’s social cuts will increase the number of kids living in poverty by 75% over the next 15 years in the UK, the Daily Mirror notes. Moreover, Berlin has already announced that social disparity will be steadily growing throughout the upcoming decade in Germany. The Finish Yle notes that the number of children living in poor families has tripled over the last two decades. What is striking is that even those families where both parents are employed full time are unable to earn an adequate revenue. Ever since 2008, the deepening social crisis in the EU has been making local citizens feeling increasingly frustrated with their elected officials. At the same time, local political elites are reluctant to address the most pressing problems of their population, instead they prefer to increase military spendings and cut social benefits provided to the poor. The chain of events, namely the Brexit and the Trumpxit shows the growing frustration of the hard-working people that are still unable to provide decent childhood for their children. And it doesn’t take a genius to know that the ruling elites are going to face a bitter electoral defeat in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Austria. There’s really no way they can win.

20353,20353,An Alternative Form of Mental Health Care Gains a Foothold - The New York Times,Benedict Carey,"HOLYOKE, Mass.  —   Some of the voices inside Caroline White’s head have been a lifelong comfort, as protective as a favorite aunt. It was the others  —   “you’re nothing, they’re out to get you, to kill you”  —   that led her down a rabbit hole of failed treatments and over a decade of hospitalizations, therapy and medications, all aimed at silencing those internal threats. At a support group here for     however, she tried something radically different. She allowed other members of the group to address the voice, directly: What is it you want?  “After I thought about it, I realized that the voice valued my safety, wanted me to be respected and better supported by others,” said Ms. White, 34, who, since that session in late 2014, has become a leader in a growing alliance of such groups, called the Hearing Voices Network, or HVN. At a time when Congress is debating measures to extend the reach of mainstream psychiatry  —   particularly to the severely psychotic, who often end up in prison or homeless  —   an alternative kind of mental health care is taking root that is very much  . It is largely nonmedical, focused on holistic recovery rather than symptom treatment, and increasingly accessible through an assortment of   services, residential centers and groups like the voices network Ms. White turned to, in which members help one another understand each voice, as a metaphor, rather than try to extinguish it. For the first time in this country, experts say, psychiatry’s critics are mounting a sustained, broadly based effort to provide people with practical options, rather than solely alleging abuses like overmedication and involuntary restraint. “The reason these programs are proliferating now is society’s shameful neglect of the severely ill, which creates a vacuum of great need,” said Dr. Allen Frances, a professor emeritus of psychiatry at Duke University. Dr. Chris Gordon, who directs a program with an approach to treating psychosis called Open Dialogue at Advocates in Framingham, Mass. calls the alternative approaches a “collaborative pathway to recovery and a paradigm shift in care. ” The Open Dialogue approach involves a team of mental health specialists who visit homes and discuss the crisis with the affected person  —   without resorting to diagnostic labels or medication, at least in the beginning. Some psychiatrists are wary, they say, given that medication can be   for many people with mental problems, and rigorous research on these alternatives is scarce. “I would advise anyone to be carefully evaluated by a psychiatrist with expertise in treating psychotic disorders before embarking on any such alternative programs,” said Dr. Ronald Pies, a professor of psychiatry at SUNY Upstate University, in Syracuse. “Many, though not all, patients with acute psychotic symptoms are too seriously ill to do without immediate medication, and lack the family support” that those programs generally rely on. Alternative care appears to be here to stay, however. Private donations for such programs have topped $5 million, according to Virgil Stucker, the executive director of CooperRiis, a residential treatment community in North Carolina. A recently formed nonprofit, the Foundation for Excellence in Mental Health Care, has made several grants, including $160, 000 to start an Open Dialogue program at Emory University and $250, 000 to study the effect of HVN groups on attendees, according to Gina Nikkel, the president and CEO of the foundation. Both programs have a long track record in Europe. About three quarters of people put on a medication for psychosis stop taking it within 18 months because of side effects or other issues, studies suggest. Some do well on other drugs others do not. “I was told by one psychiatrist at age 13 or 14 that if I didn’t take the meds, my brain would become more and more damaged,” said Ms. White, who began hearing voices in grade school. “Of course I believed it. And I became hopeless, because the drugs just made me feel worse. ” On a recent Tuesday, Ms. White and seven others who hear voices gathered at the Holyoke Center of the Western Massachusetts Recovery Learning Community, which hosts weekly   hearing voices groups, to talk about what happens in those sessions. The group meetings themselves, guided by a person who hears voices, sometimes accompanied by a facilitator, are open to family members but closed to the news media. The culture is explicitly nonpsychiatric: No one uses the word “patient” or refers to the sessions as “treatment. ” “We need to be very careful that these groups do not become medicalized in any way,” said Gail Hornstein, a professor of psychology at Mount Holyoke College and a founding figure for the American hearing voices groups, which have tripled in number over the past several years, to more than 80 groups in 21 states. Most of the people in the room had extensive experience being treated in the mainstream system. “I was told I was a ticking time bomb, that I’d never finish college, never have a job, never have kids, and always be on psychiatric medication,” said Sarah, a student at Mount Holyoke who for years has heard a voice  —   a child, crying  —   and in college started having suicidal thoughts. She was given diagnoses of borderline personality disorder and put on medications that had severe side effects. She asked that her last name not be used, to preserve her privacy. In the group, other members prompted her to listen to the child’s cries, to ask whose they were, and why the crying? Those questions led, over a period of weeks, to a recollection of a frightening experience in her childhood, and an effort to soothe the child. This altered her relationship with the voice, she said, and sometimes the child now laughs, whispers, even sings. “That is the way it works here,” said Sarah, who is set to graduate from college with honors. “In the group, everyone’s experience is real, and they make suggestions based on what has worked for them. ” Like many of the other alternative models of care, Hearing Voices Network is not explicitly  . Many people who regularly attend have prescriptions, but many have reduced dosages. “I walked in the door on Thorazine and thought I couldn’t get better,” Marty Hadge said. “About all I could do is lie on the couch, and the doctors would say, ‘Hey, you’re doing great  —   you’re not getting in trouble! ’” Mr. Hadge is now a group leader who trains others for that role. He no longer takes Thorazine or any other   medication. Not everyone benefits from airing their voices, therapists say. The pain and confusion those internal messages cause can overwhelm any effort to understand or engage. “People will come to our program because they’re determined not to be on medication,” said Dr. Gordon, the medical director of Advocates. “But that’s not always possible. The idea is to give people as many options as we can, to allow them to come up with their own   program. ” To do that, proponents of alternative care have much work to do. The programs are spread thin, and to scale up, they will probably have to set aside their native distrust of mainstream psychiatry to form alliances with clinics. In parts of Europe, including Britain and Denmark, such integration has occurred, with hearing voices groups and Open   programs widely available. In this country, there is very little collaboration. Ms. White runs a hearing voices group in the forensic psychiatry unit of a hospital in Springfield, Mass. and there is a scattering of other medical clinics that work with voices groups. But the culture gap between alternative and mainstream approaches to psychosis and other mental problem remains deep, and most psychiatrists and insurers will need to see some evidence before forming partnerships. Last month, the influential journal Psychiatric Services published the first study of the Open Dialogue program in the United States, led by Dr. Gordon and Dr. Douglas Ziedonis of the University of Massachusetts. The results are encouraging: Nine of 14 young men and women enrolled in the program for a year after a psychotic episode were still in school or working. Four are doing well without medication the others started or continued on   drugs. Insurance covered about a quarter of the overall costs. “It’s tiny, just a pilot study,” Dr. Gordon said. “But it’s a start. ”",0
20354,20354,"World’s Hottest Hole: Iceland to Harness Molten Magma for Electricity, Could Power 50,000 Homes",Editor,"By Lorraine Chow
Earth’s abundant inner heat, or geothermal energy, has incredible potential as a renewable energy source. For traditional geothermal projects, hot rocks produce steam for turbines. Over in Iceland, however, a consortium of researchers and companies want to dig much, much deeper into Earth’s crust in order to explore the renewable energy potential of molten magma.
The Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) is drilling a 5-kilometer (3.1-mile) hole into old lava flows in the Reykjanes, a region in southwest Iceland filled with geothermal sites. Once drilling is complete by the end of 2016, the Nordic nation will be home to the hottest hole in the world with temperatures between 400 and 1,000 degrees Celsius (or 752-1,832 degrees Fahrenheit), according to New Scientist .
This effort is being led by Icelandic energy companies such as Hitaveita Sudurnesja, Landsvirkjun and Orkuveita Reykjavíkur, as well as the National Energy Authority of Iceland.
Since Aug. 12, the IDDP’s rig—actually named “Thor” —has been drilling deep into a landward extension of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, an underwater mountain range that extends above sea level through the center of Iceland.
“People have drilled into hard rock at this depth, but never before into a fluid system like this,” Albert Albertsson, assistant director of a geothermal energy company involved in the project, explained to New Scientist.
At this depth, seawater that has penetrated the ocean bed has not only been superheated by magma, it’s also highly pressurized (more than 200 times atmospheric air pressure). The team expects to find water in the form of “ supercritical steam ,” aka “ dragon water ,” which is neither liquid nor steam but holds more heat energy than both.
Can ‘Dragon Water’ Power the Planet With Renewable Energy? https://t.co/P4wmMRVk61 @RenewablesNews @Good_Energy 
— EcoWatch (@EcoWatch) November 6, 2015 

Albertsson said that a well capable of harnessing this steam has an energy capacity of 50 megawatts, about 10 times more than a conventional geothermal well. Theoretically, IDDP’s new well could power 50,000 homes compared to the 5,000 homes powered by a single geothermal well.
“If they can get supercritical steam in deep boreholes, that will make an order of magnitude difference to the amount of geothermal energy the wells can produce,” Arnar Guðmundsson from Invest in Iceland, a government agency that promotes energy development, told New Scientist.
If this project this sounds a little dicey, as Motherboard explained, this isn’t the first time IDDP has tapped into Icelandic lava power:
“In 2009, an IDDP rig located in Krafla, northeast Iceland, accidentally struck a magma reservoir just over a mile underground. Excited about the prospects of new geothermal energy, the project partnered with Iceland’s National Power Company, and installed a perforated steel casing at the bottom of the well. This successfully allowed the flow of magma to create superheated, extremely pressurized steam at temperatures exceeding 800°F—at the time, a world record for geothermal heat.
“Power created by the Krafla borehole was never fed back into the grid, and the project was shuttered in 2012 after a critical valve needed repairing.”
“In the future, the success of this drilling and research project could lead to a revolution in the energy efficiency of high-temperature geothermal areas worldwide,” said Wilfred Elders, a professor emeritus of geology at the University of California, Riverside who was involved in an earlier IDDP project.
According to DeSmogBlog , New Zealand, Indonesia, the Philippines, the U.S. and Mexico already have commercial geothermal plants.
Iceland, known for its numerous bubbling hot springs and geysers, already heats up to 90 percent of its homes and supplies about a third of its electricity with geothermal.

20355,20355,"‘Duck Dynasty’ Legacy: Real, Fake and Upfront About It - The New York Times",Neil Genzlinger,"Interesting juxtaposition of the week: The AE show “Duck Dynasty” announces that the current season will be its last, and Paul Horner, who creates fake news stories on the internet, tells The Washington Post: “My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. ” “Duck Dynasty,” the reality show about the Robertson family of Louisiana and its   business, became a spectacular hit for AE after its debut in March 2012, then a spectacular headache in late 2013 when Phil Robertson, the patriarch, made remarks in a GQ interview that were widely seen as offensive to gay people. At that point the show was averaging nine million viewers a week, an amazing number for a   reality series, but the controversy cost it cachet among some viewers, and ratings have fallen considerably since. Overexposure no doubt also played a role in the show’s decline. Members of the clan became celebrities and started turning up all over the place, and the producers churned out too many episodes too quickly. Even viewers who still loved the Robertsons and their homespun antics may have been tiring of the whole premise. During Wednesday night’s Season 11 premiere, the family announced that the series would end with the finale in April. Don’t bother making a joke about the Robertsons shelving the series so they could join Donald J. Trump’s administration  —   social media was flooded with them by Thursday morning. Sure, that could happen  —   there are certainly enough Robertsons to fill every cabinet post, and Willie Robertson, the show’s central figure, was a supporter of Mr. Trump  —   but this is more likely just an example of a TV show that has run out of gas. Not without leaving a legacy, however. The series helped solidify the idea that distinguishing between real and fake, truth and fabrication, isn’t really important. I spent a day with the Robertsons in West Monroe, La. in the summer of 2012, between the show’s first and second seasons. The series was still building momentum, but even at that early stage, the Robertsons readily acknowledged that their “reality show” wasn’t real at all. That’s hardly rare  —   most reality shows are staged or at least steered toward a preplanned result, of course. But the Robertsons were unusual in that they freely admitted it. “Guided reality” is the phrase they used. The episodes didn’t simply follow the Robertsons around in their daily lives the producers would often sketch out the parameters of a situation and have the family live it. What made the show work so well was that the Robertsons, fitting the Eastern elite’s image of hicks, were in fact savvy media manipulators, excellent improvisers and telegenic as heck. And they seemed to intuit that although many of the show’s episodes were obvious setups, no one would care. “Duck Dynasty” sensed that viewers would happily embrace the reality that they wanted, even if it was a manipulated or outright invented version of reality. And now, in 2016, we have seen this flexible definition of what’s real carry into the political arena. As Mr. Horner noted, fabricated news articles streamed into receptive minds through Facebook feeds and such were a worrisome phenomenon in the presidential election, and they continue to be. “The   era,” it’s being called. (Earlier this week, “ ” was named Oxford Dictionaries’ 2016 international word of the year.) Politicians have only recently figured out how to exploit it. The Robertsons and other   dynasties have been doing it for years.",0
20356,20356,Silicon Valley Finds Trump’s Disruption Unwelcome - The New York Times,David Streitfeld,"PALO ALTO, Calif.  —   Donald J. Trump would not be Silicon Valley’s first choice as president. Or its second. Or maybe even its third. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee wants to restrict immigration while bringing back manufacturing. He compulsively uses tech products like Twitter but is not in awe of the people who built them. He made his fortune the   way, by going into the family business, in the   industry of real estate. He’s not the valley’s kind of entrepreneur. Worst of all, Mr. Trump is revealing Silicon Valley’s vulnerability. In recent years, technology companies have extended their enormous reach while becoming ever wealthier and more powerful. Yet Mr. Trump has paid no political price for attacking them, with broadsides in recent months against Jeff Bezos at Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Timothy D. Cook at Apple. “There is some surprise among tech executives  —   or perhaps just naïveté  —   that the tech mainstream is now a target,” said Garrett Johnson, an entrepreneur and one of the founders of the Lincoln Initiative, which connects    tech workers. For all these reasons, support for Mr. Trump here is minimal. Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech maverick who backed Ron Paul’s presidential bid in 2008 with millions of dollars in support, is a Trump delegate. Mr. Thiel, who was revealed last week as a secret backer of the wrestler Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker Media, is the candidate’s first, and so far only, prominent enlistee in Silicon Valley. Support for Mr. Trump here may deepen. Brian Krzanich, the chief executive of Intel, was planning to hold a   for Mr. Trump on Thursday night at his Atherton, Calif. house that included “a full exchange of views,” an Intel spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Hours later, Intel said the event was canceled. It did not give an explanation. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not return a message for comment. He is holding a rally in San Jose, Calif. on Thursday instead. The Trump campaign just opened an office in Burlingame, Calif. south of San Francisco and on the northern fringes of Silicon Valley. One recent afternoon, two volunteers were running a phone bank. Trump lawn signs were piled up, as were  . Mr. Trump has no meaningful opposition in the California primary on June 7. “I have great respect for Silicon Valley and all of the people in Silicon Valley,” the candidate said in an email message through an aide. Silicon Valley technophiles cannot necessarily claim the same. In April, as Mr. Trump was wrapping up his quest for the nomination and beginning to look ahead to the general election, a handful of people who work in tech around the country gave a grand total of $5, 395 to his campaign, according to figures that will be released Thursday by Crowdpac, a   that tracks donations. Add that paltry sum to the $16, 420 that Mr. Trump raised since last summer from people who work in tech and it is still nowhere near enough to cover the cost of a year at Stanford. Hillary Clinton has raised $2. 7 million from tech donors since beginning her campaign, while Bernie Sanders has raised $6 million, according to new Crowdpac research. Mr. Trump was largely   his campaign. Now, however, he requires cash  —   and lots of it. “Out of the millions of people who work in technology, from engineers to Uber drivers, just 52 have given to Trump. He’ll need many more if he truly intends to build a   finance organization,” said Mason Harrison, a Crowdpac spokesman. “Mitt Romney raised over $8 million from the technology sector in 2012. That’s a lot of money to leave on the table. ” Whether those tech backers are out there, however, is an unsettled question. Scott Slinker, a    entrepreneur in San Jose, Calif. gave the candidate $250 last summer. “I know Trump’s supporters are here,” he said. “They’re just not vocal. They don’t want to be stereotyped and pigeonholed and labeled. ” In at least some cases, this is correct. One employee at a software firm declined to speak on the record, saying it would be a bad career move for a Google search of his name to turn up any Republican connection, let alone one with Mr. Trump. Mr. Slinker, whose latest   Paradata, uses big data to help brands find suppliers, said Mr. Trump was a candidate very much in the spirit of Silicon Valley: “He’s a   kind of guy. He has a lot of ideas and pivots away from them if they don’t work, just like the Valley does. He’s more viral than Facebook ever was. ” Still, even Mr. Slinker says there is good reason for the lack of enthusiasm. “Silicon Valley is an extremely disruptive place, but the one thing it doesn’t want disrupted is Silicon Valley,” he said. “And so it’s pushing back on Trump. ” The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who backed Mr. Romney in 2012, said on Twitter that he was supporting Mrs. Clinton. Meg Whitman, a former candidate for governor in California who now runs Hewlett Packard Enterprise, labeled Mr. Trump “unfit to be president. ” When Mr. Thiel was revealed as a Trump delegate, a columnist for the tech news site Pando said he was “utterly ashamed” that Mr. Thiel was a Pando investor. Mr. Thiel declined to comment. Another Trump supporter in Silicon Valley, Tyrone Pike, had some business dealings with the candidate many years ago in Atlantic City, N. J. and was favorably impressed. As for Mr. Trump’s more extreme pronouncements, “I kind of write them off,” said Mr. Pike, who sold a software   to Citrix and is building another company. “He’s more of a moderate than any of his words. ” Earlier in the primaries, Mr. Trump suggested boycotting Apple if the company did not help the government crack the iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting last year in San Bernardino, Calif. clashed with Mr. Zuckerberg over immigration and posted on Twitter that if Amazon “ever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash. ” Bobby Franklin, the president of the National Venture Capital Association, thinks Mr. Trump will pick up support among tech people as he moderates his views. “The Trump we have all witnessed for the past several months is probably not the Trump we will all be thinking about as we go into the voting booth,” said Mr. Franklin, whose organization does not endorse presidential candidates. “A general election candidate has always been different than a primary candidate. ” Yet a few weeks ago, after Mr. Trump’s primary opponents all dropped out and he might have been expected to make conciliatory noises, he unloaded again on Amazon and Mr. Bezos. Mr. Trump said, among other things, that Mr. Bezos has “got a huge antitrust problem because he’s controlling so much. ” Mr. Bezos owns The Washington Post, which has covered Mr. Trump intensively and critically. The internet tycoon said at a   tech conference that he was “very, very comfortable with all of Amazon’s approaches and behaviors,” The Post reported. Mr. Trump’s comments signal a turnabout from Amazon’s experience under President Obama. The retailer helped instigate and was the major beneficiary of an antitrust case the Justice Department brought against Apple and the major book publishers. Jay Carney, a former press secretary for Mr. Obama, is now senior vice president for corporate affairs at Amazon. He declined to comment. The Obama administration was even closer to Google, drawing several staff members from the search giant, including Megan Smith, the chief technology officer of the United States. Mrs. Clinton is a closer fit with Silicon Valley than Mr. Trump, both ideologically and culturally, but she is not campaigning as tech’s champion. Whoever wins in November, the tech community is likely to look back longingly at the last eight years. “That tech is now a flash point in campaign debates is a reflection of the industry’s power and ubiquity in American life,” said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican strategist who has worked with the tech industry. “Silicon Valley will need to learn to expect that it won’t be seen as a benevolent actor in every quarter, and prepare accordingly. ” In other words, he said, “the era of Silicon Valley exceptionalism is over. ”",0
20357,20357,Portugal Detains Former C.I.A. Officer Sought by Italy - The New York Times,Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura and Elisabetta Povoledo,"The Portuguese authorities have detained a former undercover C. I. A. officer whose extradition has been sought by Italy, where she faces a prison sentence over her role in the 2003 kidnapping of an Egyptian cleric as part of a secret United States rendition program. The former officer, Sabrina De Sousa, 60, was detained Monday night and is awaiting imminent extradition to Italy, one of her lawyers, Dario Bolognesi, said. Ms. De Sousa was among 26 Americans convicted of grabbing the cleric, Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, in Milan in February 2003. The operation was one of the   renditions ordered by the George W. Bush’s administration after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Suspects were captured and taken to other countries for interrogation. The program was ended by the Barack Obama administration. Mr. Nasr was taken to a military base before being moved to Egypt, where he said he was tortured. In 2013, an Italian court sentenced him in absentia to six years in prison for   activities. At the time he was plucked off the streets, Ms. De Sousa, a native of India and a dual citizen of the United States and Portugal, was in Milan posing as a diplomat. She resigned from the C. I. A. in 2009. Convicted in absentia, she was sentenced to four years in prison. Despite facing possible arrest, she returned to Portugal in 2015. That October, she was briefly detained under a European arrest warrant and her passports were confiscated. She was arrested Monday as she was on her way to India to visit relatives, according to news accounts that cited her lawyer in Portugal. Mr. Bolognesi, her lawyer in Milan, said Tuesday that she emailed him Monday night to tell him that she had been arrested in Lisbon and was awaiting transfer to Italy. He said he had not heard from her since. Mr. Bolognesi met with Italian Justice Ministry officials in Rome on Tuesday, but he said that the officials told him that they “had not received any official communication” from the Portuguese authorities. At the ministry, Mr. Bolognesi reiterated his request that Ms. De Sousa be given a pardon, as had been granted to some of the officers involved in the rendition. He has also requested that she serve her time doing public service, rather than be jailed. Ms. De Sousa is likely to serve her prison sentence in Milan, Mr. Bolognesi said, because the European arrest warrant had been issued by prosecutors there. Her lawyer in Portugal, Manuel de Magalhães e Silva, could not be reached for comment. Ms. De Sousa’s case is among several related to rendition operations that have been brought to trial. In January, Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that Abdel Hakim Belhaj, a Libyan dissident who said he was abducted and tortured by American and British intelligence agents, could sue the British government and a former foreign secretary over his rendition.",0

Holmes didn’t have $40 million to pay for a high school. Community leaders reached out to Derrick Johnson, state president of the N. A. A. C. P. who also helps underserved Mississippi neighborhoods and districts with strategic planning. “Poor communities here are especially vulnerable,” Mr. Johnson told me the other day. “The whole system perpetuates exploitation. Residents need people they can trust. ” So Mr. Johnson enlisted Roy Decker and Anne Marie Duvall,    architects from Jackson. Since they founded Duvall Decker nearly 20 years ago, the Deckers, as they’re known, have focused mostly on neglected corners in and around Jackson, Mississippi’s capital. To pay the bills, the two have redefined for themselves the ambit of a small architectural practice. They have become developers and even branched into building maintenance: a    strategy that has allowed them more than just financial breathing room. “Assuming more risk and responsibility has also given us a stronger voice, upfront, in this community, with politicians and businesspeople,” Ms. Duvall pointed out. “That’s because we have skin in the game. ” Architects are forever complaining about feeling undervalued, about having lost a seat at the   table. Big ideas  —   the ones that shape whole cities and ultimately determine what is built, for whom and where  —   mostly happen “during the first 10 percent of any project,” as Mr. Decker likes to put it, meaning before architects are called in to design something. For the Deckers, like more and more socially minded architects today, reclaiming that seat is an increasing priority. “When young architects apply to work for us,” Ms. Duvall said, “we ask what they want. Sometimes they say they want to design buildings that are unique, to express themselves. Other times they say they hope their work will have good consequences in a community. We’re finding more young people answering the second way. ” The architect Billie Tsien was a juror for the Architectural League in New York that just gave the Deckers an Emerging Voices award. “There’s a lot of fashionable work out there,” Ms. Tsien said. “Anyone who has done public work for nonprofits can appreciate the effort it takes to make even a smidgen of architecture happen. ” I met some of the people who live and work in the buildings the Deckers have designed. For Midtown, a Jackson neighborhood where the poverty rate hovers around 50 percent, the architects produced a master plan with affordable housing. The   homes  —       modernist duplexes with solar panels and tall   porches  —   have helped resuscitate a main street. Duvall Decker also renovated a nearby strip mall long dominated by a pair of liquor stores. The stores are now gone, replaced by a community health center, the mall painted a stylish slate gray, with shiny   benches and window frames beneath a lofty new portico. The Deckers eked their smidgens out of the arrangement of drainpipes and new signage. With a little money from the city housing authority and a mix of local nonprofits, a mall that used to blight the neighborhood has become an advertisement for it. The architects are looking to do something as transformative for Up in Farms, a food hub that links farmers (average income: $10, 000 a year) with Jackson restaurants, groceries and food banks. The Deckers are upgrading a dilapidated 1940s farmers market in the city. “They have also helped clarify our organization and reduce our costs,” said David Watkins Jr. who runs the hub. “They’re focused on our whole business and our outcomes, not just on designing space. ” Likewise, with Holmes County, the architects consulted parents and teachers on curriculums for kindergarten through 12th grade because the schools’ problems clearly went well beyond a single building. The Deckers brought in a tech consultant to help develop interactive digital learning tools  —   thinking about virtual space “in the same way we are thinking about buildings,” as Mr. Decker put it. Duvall Decker’s plan consolidates several     schools in the shell of an abandoned factory whose reconfiguration will cost residents a fraction of the $40 million the earlier firm originally discussed for just the high school. It’s instructive that Mr. Decker once taught architecture alongside Samuel Mockbee, the beloved, charismatic   of the Rural Studio, who died in 2001. Rural Studio trains Auburn University students to design highly refined buildings for poor communities, mostly in west Alabama. The Deckers acknowledge Rural Studio’s impact. But they don’t think of themselves as part of that legacy. Mr. Decker describes Mockbee’s initial strategy as a kind of   “creative abduction and aestheticized version” of Southern vernacular design. “Rural Studio has always done great   work, but we can’t depend on free labor,” Ms. Duvall added. We were talking on the sunny patio of a restaurant near Duvall Decker’s office, in a growing commercial area of   1950s buildings a couple of miles from downtown. What Mr. Decker said is the only abortion clinic left in Mississippi is just up the block. Next door is a building the Deckers bought years ago. They became almost accidental developers, acquiring a derelict site for a potential studio, receiving an offer to buy it within weeks, and realizing that real estate, on a modest scale, could subsidize their practice. Across the street, in what used to be a dry cleaner, they’re now partners in what expanded will become a hotel. At the same time, the firm fixes leaky pipes and broken windows for clients like an   program called Operation Shoestring. When the lights go out at a veterans’ home mortgage association, another client, Duvall Decker sends over an electrician. When rain falls on the headquarters of a community college honor society, the Deckers themselves sometimes go up on the roof afterward to clear the gutters and sweep away puddles. It’s all of a piece: architecture conceived as buildings with many lives. Tough and pragmatic, Duvall Decker’s work relies on an evolving vocabulary of economical materials and attunement to Southern light. A state library the Deckers designed exploits the changing shadows cast by an irregular grid of precast concrete panels on the facade. Light pours through huge windows into a     reading room for the state book collections. At a civil rights research center and art museum on the campus of Tougaloo, the historically black college on the northern edge of Jackson, I asked Beverly Wade Hogan, the president, what it’s like to work with Duvall Decker. “I talk a lot about what this school means and what it stands for,” she told me. “Roy and Anne listen. ” That’s the goal, Mr. Decker said. “The world is what you make of it,” he added. “For most people here in Mississippi, it’s hard. Our fundamental job as architects is to make it better. ”",0
20360,20360,The Secret to Good Toast? It’s Your Freezer - The New York Times,Emily Weinstein,"Toast lovers, I have a modest proposal for you: Do not bother with bad bread. Say goodbye to sweet, cottony, lightweight toast, the kind that squishes under a butter knife or slumps under a blanket of jam. Just get the good stuff instead, the best bread you’re able to buy, preferably handmade loaves with sturdy crusts and tender crumbs, imbued with the flavors of fermentation. It’s more expensive, and that’s no small thing. But unlike some other items for which you may pay more, good bread is worth a little extra. Then always keep it on hand. I would argue that the best way to store bread isn’t to wrap it in foil, plastic or brown paper bags, sheath it in a pillowcase or stash it in the breadbox. The best way to keep bread is to put it into the freezer  —   sliced. The slicing is crucial here. (It’s also a minor heresy, but hear me out.) Home bread bakers know that a whole loaf freezes incredibly well. But when you defrost it, you replicate the problem of a whole loaf fresh out of the oven: Unless you have a full house, it’s a race to finish it before it goes stale. (Yes, you could make bread crumbs, but with apologies to devotees of schnitzel and gratins, who actually needs that many bread crumbs?) There are only two of us at my place, so a big loaf of fresh bread is difficult to take down. By contrast, slices of good bread in the freezer practically qualify as convenience food: single serving and ever ready, the base of a luxuriously simple breakfast, a satisfying lunch, a restorative snack, a relaxed supper. And because you have stored your slices in the freezer, they do not degrade in the quick and nasty style of sliced bread left to languish at room temperature. Here’s what I do: Whenever I see an alluring loaf of bread, I buy it, take it home, then start slicing, cutting about half the loaf into thick,   slices. I put the pieces in a plastic zipper bag and pop them into the freezer. (Halved bagels work well, too.) Then any time I want a piece of toast, I take a slice out of the freezer and put it directly into the toaster. Professional bakers may blanch, but I think the results are nearly as good as toasting a slice from a   loaf on the counter. You don’t need any particular type of toaster. But you do need to think of your freezer periodically. You don’t want to just abandon bread to time and freezer burn, though I can tell you from experience that neglected slices will still work, even if the toasted texture won’t be nearly as good. Whatever you do, do not drag the microwave into this, no matter how deeply frozen the bread. This is between you, the freezer and the toaster. Bear in mind that the fresher your bread is when it goes in the freezer, the better your results will be. So gauge how much you want to eat fresh, and just freeze the rest. You could even freeze it all at once, a formidable supply of toast in case the craving strikes.",0
20361,20361,"For Those Keeping Score, American Women Dominated in Rio - The New York Times",Jeré Longman,"RIO DE JANEIRO  —   The very idea of a medal count might seem contrary to the spirit of the Olympics, which are supposed to bring the world together for a couple of weeks and suspend the nationalism that keeps us apart. Yet keeping score is the essence of sport. And measured by the haul of gold, silver and bronze, the United States had an extraordinary Olympics in Rio, winning 121 medals, the most by an American team in a Summer Games free of boycotts. The size and depth of the United States team resulted in the most gold (46) silver (37) and bronze (38) medals of any nation. Only five countries have topped each medal category at the same Games. The Americans were the first to do it in 40 years, enabled in part by the barring of nearly a third of Russia’s team after revelations of   doping. (Another reliable powerhouse, China, underperformed.) “This has been an incredible Games for Team U. S. A. by any measure,” Alan Ashley, the chief of sport performance for the United States Olympic Committee, said Sunday at a news conference. Most striking was the performance by the American women. The American men won 18 gold medals, the same as Britain. But the American women were dominant with 27 (not including a gold in mixed doubles tennis). Had the women competed as a separate country, they would have ranked third in the overall medal chart (61) behind China (70) and Britain (67) and just ahead of the American men (60). There are two primary reasons for this  . The United States is one of the few countries to embed sports within the public education system. And equal access to sports for women comes with legal protections, gained with the education amendment known as Title IX in 1972 and the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act in 1978. About one of every two American girls participates in sports in high school. Of the 213 American medalists in individual and team sports in Rio, according to the U. S. O. C. nearly 85 percent participated in   sports. “Those things don’t exist elsewhere in the world,” said Donna Lopiano, a former executive director of the Women’s Sports Foundation. “We have the largest base of athletic development. Our women are going to dominate, not only because of their legal rights but because women in other parts of the world are discriminated against. ” In the United States, more women than men watch the Summer Olympics on television. Girls see role models to emulate, and success perpetuates success. The champion performances by three   athletes  —   Simone Biles, who won four gold medals in gymnastics Simone Manuel, the first black woman to win Olympic gold in an individual swimming event and Ashleigh Johnson, the goalie for the    women’s water polo team  —   are certain to broaden participation in sports that have historically been white. Ibtihaj Muhammad, who won a bronze medal in saber team fencing, became the first Olympic athlete to compete for the United States while wearing a hijab. And it was a women’s team, in the   medley relay in swimming, that won the 1, 000th gold medal for the Americans since the modern Games began, in 1896. “You get on a roll,” said David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians. “Girls are looking and saying, ‘Wow, I can do that,’ whereas 30 years ago, not so many American girls thought that. It builds and builds. ” A country of 320 million, the United States ranked only 43rd in medals per capita, well behind small countries that won multiple medals, like Jamaica, New Zealand, Denmark, Croatia, Azerbaijan and Hungary, according to medalspercapita. com.   of the medals won by the United States, more than half of its total, came in swimming and track and field, the two sports offering the most chances to win medals. It also surely helped that American athletes competed in a time zone only one hour ahead of Eastern Daylight Time and did not have to risk jet lag by traveling to an Olympics in Europe or Asia. And some American success can be attributed to underperformance by other nations. Because of the doping controversy, Russia’s entire weight lifting team was barred, and so was all but one athlete on its track and field team. Australia won its fewest Olympic medals (29) since the 1992 Barcelona Games. With 70 medals, China finished second over all, but that was 30 fewer than it won at the 2008 Beijing Games. This fits a pattern of host countries’ ebbing two Olympics later, Wallechinsky said. “You have seven years to prepare for an Olympics, everybody gets pumped up, you put money into different sports, you do well at home, and you develop a bunch of role models,” Wallechinsky said. “But that doesn’t necessarily carry over twice. There’s a consistent pattern of the host doing well, then pretty well at the next Olympics, then back to normal. ” Brazil won 19 medals, its highest total ever, but not as many as recent host nations like Britain (65) in 2012, China (100) in 2008 and Australia (58) in 2000. Home teams generally receive increased financial support in preparation for a Summer Olympics, but Brazil lacks an organized funding system for sports, and the Rio Games arrived with the country in an economic and political crisis. Still, Brazil won the gold medal it prized most  —   its first in men’s soccer. More ambitious drug testing may have also affected the makeup of the Chinese team and others in Rio, Wallechinsky said. Several experts said that although enhanced international antidoping measures are far from perfect and have ensnared Americans, they might have particularly aided the success of the United States’ track and field team in Rio, as enhanced funding and training camps supported by shoe companies and U. S. A. Track  Field did. Michelle Carter became the first American woman to win the Olympic  . And the United States, long a sprint power, won medals in   and   running from 800 meters to the marathon, highlighted by Matt Centrowitz’s victory at 1, 500 meters, the metric mile. He was the first American to win the event since 1908. “A level playing field benefits all athletes and helps our medal chances,” said Jill Geer, a spokeswoman for U. S. A. Track  Field. The ruthless nature of selecting a team at the Olympic trials, instead of by past performances, also appeared to be an important factor, Centrowitz said. Brianna Rollins, Nia Ali and Kristi Castlin of the United States swept the   hurdles in Rio while the   holder, an American named Kendra Harrison, did not make the team. “It’s not the three fastest people on paper it’s the best three people on a given day,” Centrowitz said, describing team selection per event at the Olympic trials. “And that’s what you had to do here, perform on that specific day. ”",0

20364,20364,"ESPN’s Historic Setback: Celebrate It, but Not for Too Long - Breitbart",Dylan Gwinn,"The era of big cable sports is over. [It ended on Wednesday, April 25, 2017, when ESPN began laying off 100 writers and   radio and television talent.  The era began after 2011, ESPN’s high water mark, with the network viewed in over 100 million households. Then, resulting from a combination of   and wanton leftist propaganda disguised as sports coverage, the cable dinosaur saw its once flourishing empire reduced to a relative fiefdom. ESPN lost over twelve million subscribers since 2012, and according to some reports, 10, 000 subscribers a day. The subscriber losses led to layoffs in 2013, and again in 2015. For much of America, and certainly most on the right, the message of ESPN’s historic setback seems clear: stop bringing leftist activism into our sports escapism. Cease using sports as a Trojan horse to masquerade a social justice agenda, and maybe people will want to watch your network. But, what lesson did ESPN take from their setback? For the purposes of this discussion, it’s more important to take a look at who ESPN didn’t layoff, as opposed to who they did. According to the sports media site Awful Announcing, which kept a tracker of the ESPN layoffs throughout Wednesday, of the 60   talent and writers who publicly acknowledged being laid off before midnight central time on Wednesday, none of them, not a single one, were among the usual suspects when it comes to purveying leftist activism at ESPN. Tony Kornheiser, who once likened Tea Party Republicans to ISIS remains at ESPN. So does his     partner Michael Wilbon. Bomani Jones, who once appeared on Mike  Mike in a “Caucasians” tee shirt remains at ESPN as does Kevin Blackistone, who once ripped Michael Jordan for donating one million dollars to the police. Granted, only 60 of the reported 100 have been laid off, and some of the more liberal personalities at ESPN could very well find themselves without a job on Thursday. However, as of the time of this writing, one thing is clear: If America’s   and ratings killing of ESPN was an attempt to send the message that we wanted less politics in their sports coverage, that message fell on deaf ears. Not that anyone should shed a tear about what happened on Wednesday. ESPN losing influence and power is a great thing. Anytime the people who gave Caitlyn Jenner the Arthur Ashe Courage Award lose the ability to influence young minds, that’s a win for America. However, the fact that ESPN laid off none of their worst political offenders, clearly shows that the leftists are still very much in control in Bristol, and if that didn’t change after losing twelve million subscribers, it won’t change anytime soon. Why does that matter? ESPN may have laid off nearly half their total talent on Wednesday, but they didn’t hang the “going out of business” sign on the door either. The era of big, cable sports died Wednesday, but the era of big liberal sports will go on. ESPN is currently investing massively in their digital properties, sensing that digital and online offerings will become the wave of the future as more and more people move away from cable and traditional television. But, if the same people who turned the ESPYs into an   Amendment infomercial are still calling the shots, then ESPN’s future digital properties will represent just as big a threat to our culture as they did when they appeared on Channel 206 of your DirecTV package. In fact, if anything, ESPN will likely become more political in the future, especially after their social justice agenda was so roundly rejected by so many. Sports fans who want to watch games and debate free of political persuasion won a battle yesterday. But, the war will go on. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0
20365,20365,James Comey Denied Leaking Under Oath — Days Before Leak from One-on-One Dinner with Trump,Aaron Klein,"How things have changed. Only nine days ago, James Comey, then director of the FBI, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on FBI oversight that he had never been an anonymous source for news reports related to the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. [Comey further testified that he never authorized anyone else at the FBI to serve as an anonymous source in news media coverage of that investigation or the agency’s probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server.  Fast forward to yesterday. The New York Times published intimate details allegedly from inside a    dinner at the White House between Comey and Trump that took place seven days after the president was sworn in. The article quoted liberally from “two people who have heard [Comey’s] account of the dinner” in what seems to be a leak from Comey’s camp to fight back after Trump fired Comey earlier this week.  At one point in the article, the Times describes the sources as “associates” of Comey’s. The White House disputed the Times’ dinner account, which claims that Trump asked Comey to pledge loyalty to him. “We don’t believe this to be an accurate account,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, told the Times. “The integrity of our law enforcement agencies and their leadership is of the utmost importance to President Trump. He would never even suggest the expectation of personal loyalty, only loyalty to our country and its great people. ” Trump also tweeted the following warning about Comey leaking to the news media. James Comey better hope that there are no ”tapes” of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017,  The alleged leaks follow Comey’s May 3 testimony in which he steadfastly denied aiding in leaks to the news media regarding the FBI’s investigations into alleged Russian interference or the Clinton email probe. The denials came during the following exchange with Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley ( ): GRASSLEY: And thank you for your opening statement. I’m going to start out probably with a couple subjects you wish I didn’t bring up, and then a third one that I think everybody needs to hear your opinion on on a policy issue. It is frustrating when the FBI refuses to answer this committee’s questions, but leaks relevant information to the media. In other words, they don’t talk to us, but somebody talks to the media. Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation? COMEY: Never. GRASSLEY: Question two, relatively related, have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?

20366,20366,40-Year Sentence Handed Down in Kidnapping Case Police Called a ’Hoax’ - Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,"On Thursday a   kidnapper was sentenced to   in prison in a kidnapping case that Vallejo Police Department described as a “hoax. ”[The kidnapper, Matthew Muller, was a Harvard Law School graduate and former Marine. He was found guilty and sentenced over the March 23, 2015, kidnapping of Denise Huskins.  According to the Los Angeles Times, Huskins and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn were asleep in a home on Mare Island when they awoke to see Muller standing by them. He held them at bay with a water gun —  which was painted to look real —  then drugged, bound, and blindfolded them. He put Huskins in the trunk of Quinn’s car, then moved her to the trunk of a second vehicle and drove her to his parents’ South Lake Tahoe home. Once there, Huskins said she was “secured on a bed with a zip tie and a bike lock and blindfolded with a pair of   swim goggles” and sexually assaulted. On March 25, 2015, Muller drove Huskins to Huntington Beach and released her. Vallejo police were suspicious because Huskins “reappeared carrying an overnight bag and wearing sunglasses. ” Vallejo police Capt. James O’Connell said Huskins “did not act like a kidnapping victim. ” Less the 24 hours after Huskins was released the VPD equated the kidnapping investigation to a “wild goose chase. ” Vallejo Police Lt. Kenny Park said, “Today, there is no evidence to support the claims that this was a stranger abduction or an abduction at all. Given the facts that have been presented thus far, this event appears to be an orchestrated event and not a crime. ” CBS San Francisco reports that the police actually “accused” Huskins and Quinn of “making up the crime. ” The FBI arrested Muller on June 8, 2015, after identifying him from a failed kidnapping attempt that had occurred prior to Huskins’ abduction. The Vallejo PD sent a letter to Huskins and Quinn a month after Muller’s arrest, saying, “It is now clear that there was a kidnapping on March 23, 2015, that it was not a hoax or orchestrated event and that VPD conclusions were incorrect. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

20368,20368,How Do You Tell a Better Story in Sports? - The New York Times,Jay Caspian Kang,"The modern N. B. A. era began in the 1980s with two    if only   narratives. The rivalry between Larry Bird and Magic Johnson was transmitted to the public through sportswriters who typecast Bird as the white country bumpkin who gritted his way to excellence and Johnson as the black,   savant who whipped up his   talents into the best show on the hardwood. The cities of Boston (parochial and solemn) and Los Angeles (flashy and morally suspect) were featured in supporting roles that echoed the best and worst traits of the main characters. The reality behind “Bird versus Magic” was mostly irrelevant. What mattered was that the choice you were supposed to make between them was laid out as   as possible. In recent years, there has been a movement to replace these hoary old sports stories with an atomized landscape of numbers, stats and transactional analysis  —   and its adherents harbor a healthy amount of scorn for anyone who thinks differently. The move toward dispassionate stats is for the greater good sportswriting and fandom are too often unctuous and absurd and lend themselves to blanket moralizing in which the athlete is reduced to some lesson about life itself. If he does not hustle to first base on a ground ball, he becomes a   for the insufficient work ethic of his entire generation. If he happens to be an immigrant or from a racial minority, he becomes a   for his entire people. Despite the growing influence of the rationalists  —   the analysts and wonks who want to tear this all down  —   the mainstream sports industrial complex, especially in the loftier parts of the media, doesn’t share their vision. Narrative, with all its lies, still dominates. This has been a summer filled with silly sports schlock, spurred by NBC’s Olympic Games coverage, which carried on its tradition of dramatically lit,     reels: a young athlete learns to swim after meeting a dolphin at a water park in Tarzana, Calif. a towheaded future equestrian rider falls in love with a   horse in Darien, Conn. and so on. But the season’s story time had already started on July 4, when Kevin Durant, one of the most beloved players in the N. B. A. announced that he would be leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder for the Golden State Warriors. The expected take quake was set off, split along the usual lines. The new rationalists pointed out that Durant is a man and argued that nobody has any right to criticize any decision a man makes for himself and his family  —   before they quickly pivoted to their charts showing how Durant would change the Warriors’ expected win total. The traditionalists chanted their   odes to loyalty, competitiveness and Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, who each played their entire careers with one team. In Oklahoma City itself, the reaction played out much as it had in Cleveland when LeBron James left. Fans ripped up Durant jerseys and delivered weepy testimonials to the powerful bonds between a city and its star athlete. Overnight, Durant went from fan favorite to just the latest in the N. B. A. ’s litany of “selfish” players like Allen Iverson, Dennis Rodman or LeBron James, people who have come to embody everything that’s wrong with America. The next episode in this melodrama came in early August, when the Thunder and their other great player, Russell Westbrook, agreed to a contract extension. (People had speculated that he would leave too.) There were a lot of reasonable fiscal reasons for Westbrook’s decision  —   within the N. B. A. ’s byzantine   rules, it helped him maximize the money he could make over the rest of his career  —   and none of Westbrook’s other rumored destinations, whether Boston or New York or Los Angeles, guaranteed the success that Durant will surely enjoy with the Warriors. But Westbrook, who has mostly stayed quiet about Durant’s exit, will now be the living embodiment of every traditional thing that fans,   callers and screaming TV heads have demanded from athletes. He is staying with the   team with which he began his career,   saving the relevance of professional basketball in Oklahoma. He is also spurning, at least for now, the impulse to join a superteam with other superstars. Westbrook has decided to go it alone, and every Dennis from Dumont or Paulie from Passaic who calls in to WFAN and asks the   host Mike Francesa how he can possibly raise a son in a world where   disloyal athletes strut around unpunished has a new hero. Durant’s departure for Golden State seemed to be a bellwether moment, not only in the potential fortunes of two basketball teams but also in the way that sports news is transmuted into fable that has its own relatable and    lesson. The old, familiar moralizing, mainly delivered in   rants about loyalty or cowardice or traditions by a       on ESPN or Fox Sports, was met with a swift and forceful response by the rationalists. During the night of Durant’s announcement, in fact, it felt as if the counterreaction beat the reaction, as hundreds of rationalists tweeted   against an opinion that hadn’t even yet been aired. Sean Newell, writing for Vice Sports (I am also a correspondent at Vice) voiced their frustration when he wrote: “No one in the world should care where Kevin Durant plays basketball, and they certainly shouldn’t care enough to scream about it on ESPN. But sportswriters, even though their job is to report on   topics, write fiction. ” The problem with Newell’s critique is that nearly everyone who watches the N. B. A. except a small population of analytics wonks and insiders, really does care where Kevin Durant plays basketball. The zealotry of those in pursuit of some objective “truth” in sports, I’ve started to think, might be turning the entire spectacle into something that can no longer be recognized by a vast majority of fans. If you excise both fandom and the metaphorical weight of how the actions of an athlete might reflect on your own life, then what, exactly, are we watching? And why? The impulse to expunge all this and turn watching sports into an accounting exercise filled with insider jargon reflects some of the   elitism that has entered our national political conversation. While neither the stakes nor the messages are analogous, the mechanism through which they are conveyed feels very much the same. It is, in essence, a   between those who believe themselves to be in the know and the simps who lap up everything they watch on cable news. But not all narratives, whether political or athletic, are fictions, and there are still emotional and existential lessons that can be summoned by the sight of men and women chasing a ball around a field. There is ample ground between the current approach to N. F. L. news, for example, which amounts to treating it as either a stock ticker of microtransactions or a perpetual   machine, and the attitude given expression earlier this month by John Miller, chief marketing officer for NBC’s Olympic Games coverage, to explain why his network relegated several key Olympic events to tape delay. “More women watch the Games than men,” Miller said, “and for the women, they’re less interested in the result and more interested in the journey. ” A defense of sports narratives does not have to accept Miller’s retrograde thinking. That it so often has is not proof that every telling is corrupted, but rather that the authors have mostly failed. Durant versus Westbrook will be next year’s dominant N. B. A. motif because it brings in the full breadth of the rich, if at times overblown, metaphors that have always driven the best sportswriting: loyalty versus   the individual versus the empire and solidarity with the underdog versus the cynical efficiency of the superteam. The personalities of both players, on court and off, should be enough to compel our attention, supplemented by all the data analysis you could ever want. Even if we should balk at any easy moralizing, there’s no need to sacrifice a good story in the process.",0
20369,20369,Why isnt observer evidence like eyewitness accounts counted as evidence for UFOs?,neoholographic,"Why isn't observer evidence like eyewitness accounts counted as evidence for UFO's? page: 1 link Eyewitness accounts have been used by Science for years. Newton used eyewtiness accounts in the Principia when talking about comets. He came up with a theory on comets based on recorded sighting throughout the world like a boy saw a comet and this is what he described. There wasn't any internet to even verify the credibility of these eyewitness accounts yet Newton used them to come up with a theory about comets which helped lead to his equations of Gravity. So if eyewitness accounts are so unreliable, how did Newton use them to come up with his theories? We also saw this with meteorites. This is from Wiki: Although meteors have been known since ancient times, they were not known to be an astronomical phenomenon until early in the 19th century. Prior to that, they were seen in the West as an atmospheric phenomenon, like lightning, and were not connected with strange stories of rocks falling from the sky. In 1807, Yale University chemistry professor Benjamin Silliman investigated a meteorite that fell in Weston, Connecticut.[27] Silliman believed the meteor had a cosmic origin, but meteors did not attract much attention from astronomers until the spectacular meteor storm of November 1833.[28] People all across the eastern United States saw thousands of meteors, radiating from a single point in the sky. Astute observers noticed that the radiant, as the point is now called, moved with the stars, staying in the constellation Leo.[29] ASTUTE OBSERVERS saw meteors radiating from a single point in the sky and to this day this is still called the radient. I thought Science never uses eyewitness accounts? Also, here's a list of published papers and studies on U.F.O.'s. This page offers a list of 100+ articles, papers and monographs about UFOs / UAPs published in professional journals and specialty publications. Two polls of professional & amateur astronomers respectively, on whether they see UFOs or not. Finally 60+ PhD dissertations and academic publications about UFOs. Very little peer-reviewed literature has been published in which academics have proposed, studied or supported non-prosaic explanations for UFOs. www.hyper.net... Why aren't there more non-prosaic explanations of U.F.O.'s? That alone lends support to the notion that extraterrestrial visitation has occurred. I have had 3 sightings myself. Two looked like probes. It was real windy one day and the wind was almost knocking me over, then this round orb passed in front of me going against the wind. It slowed down and then it sped back up. Where are all the Scientist explaining U.F.O.'s? Why are there still these unidentified objects in the sky? We have aeriel phenomena in the sky that can avoid radar, outrun our best planes and cause nuclear facilities to malfunction. After 60 or more years of these sightings why can't Scientist explain these things like Newton did with comets based on eyewitness accounts or what happened with metorites? Here's 565 eyewitness accounts",1
20370,20370,Exposed: AT&T Has Been Working With Washington to Spy on Americans for Years,nan,"Get short URL 0 6 0 0 Secret surveillance software developed by US communication giant AT&T to track and spy on drug traffickers for the government appears to have been migrated to be used as a universal tool to surveil the company’s entire network, additionally bringing profits to the multinational conglomerate, new documents reveal. New Reality: Future Space Weapons Will Be Able to Destroy Enemy Satellites The quietly developed program, known as Project Hemisphere, was first detailed by the New York Times in 2013, but few know when the program was initially launched. In the 2000s, AT&T was said to have created software to dig through its databases, in an attempt to identify criminal activity. The communications company was revealed in 2007 to have handed over personal user data to law enforcement, causing public outcry.
In the 2013 Times report, Project Hemisphere was branded as a cooperative effort between AT&T and the Federal Drug Administration. It was said that the communication corporation used its data-mining software to surveil its phone records, analyzing and handing over information to authorities. The data includes user locations, timing of conversations, as well as possible reasons for talks. © REUTERS/ Mike Blake Nevermind Transparency: White House Unlikely to Declassify Secret Yahoo Email Order AT&T is the second-largest communication provider in the US, after Verizon, and operates a large complement of cell towers and wireless infrastructure. It retains cellphone records of its customers, beginning in 2008.
On Tuesday, the Daily Beast released AT&T documents detailing that the corporation has been quietly cooperating with law enforcement for years, providing huge amounts of data on customers without going through the legal channels required by US law. 
Episodes include the concealed facilitation by AT&T into far-reaching homicide and Medicaid fraud inquiries. The only condition that AT&T laid down on the federal surveillance agencies was that the phone company not be revealed to have freely participated in investigations. One paper details that the corporation sought to disallow law enforcement to use evidence obtained through Project Hemisphere in court. From Flying Start to Abrupt End: Sweden Bans Drone Photography “The Government agency agrees not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceedings unless there is no other available and admissible probative evidence,” the 2014 statement reads.
Adam Schwartz, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explained that the request pushed investigators to create false investigative narratives, that allowed for digging up evidence on suspects and keeping their sources hidden. In the meantime, AT&T enjoyed growing revenues from allowing authorities to use Project Hemisphere. According to documents, the spy-program earnings grew, from $77,924 in 2007, to $940,000 in 2011. 
Christopher Soghoian, an ACLU analyst, sees Project Hemisphere as a natural evolution of AT&T’s cooperation with federal surveillance networks. 
“They’ve developed this massive program and of course they’re going to sell it to as many people as possible,” he said to the Daily Beast. 
The revelation has stirred controversy in the US, especially in the wake of the recently-announced merger deal between AT&T and Time Warner, which still must undergo regulatory scrutiny before being closed. ...",1
20371,20371,Satisfaction and Fear of Reprisals in Syria After Missile Strike - The New York Times,Hwaida Saad and Nour Youssef,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   For Syrians who have withstood years of unbridled assault and deprivation by the forces of President Bashar   the American missile strike on a military airfield served as a   adrenaline shot of vengeful satisfaction, tinged with cynicism and fear. Residents in the city of Homs, near Al Shayrat airfield, which was hit with dozens of   Tomahawk missiles in the predawn hours on Friday local time, praised the strike. So did residents of the northern   town of Khan Sheikhoun, the site of a deadly attack on Tuesday that used what was probably the nerve agent sarin  —   an attack the United States said had been carried out by Syrian warplanes from the airfield. “We will not kneel! We will not kneel!” dozens of marchers in Khan Sheikhoun shouted in a video that activists posted on Facebook. Small children later joined the protesters, and the group was filmed standing silently in a circle, carrying pictures of the victims of the attack. The smell from the chemical assault lingered in the air in parts of Khan Sheikhoun on Friday, residents there said via telephone, Skype and internet messaging. Some praised President Trump, contrasting him favorably with President Barack Obama, who studiously avoided using military force against Mr. Assad in Syria despite his famous “red line,” which was crossed by the first big chemical weapons assault there nearly four years ago. “The people here were suffocated by sarin, Trump came and vented the anger,” Abdul Wahab   a member of the Khan Sheikhoun local council, said in a message posted via WhatsApp. “It’s the best news I’ve heard in the past few days, it’s a revenge for the martyrs’ blood,” he wrote. “We’re feeling some relief now. In the past, Obama used to say only words Trump said and acted. ” At the same time, he said, many residents were still hiding in shelters, fearful that Mr. Assad’s forces would send their own message of defiance with another attack on the town. Othman   an   activist from Khan Sheikhoun, said Mr. Trump “finally broke the longstanding silence of the Obama administration” on American entanglement in the Syrian conflict. “This response is good in a way, but we can’t say that it is enough,” he said. Some in Khan Sheikhoun were cynical, saying Mr. Assad’s behavior would not change. “We were all happy until they said that America gave Russia notice. That means that they probably emptied the airport of all the working planes,” said Refaat Youssef, who lost 26 relatives in the chemical attack. “This is a tranquilizer shot. If you really want to put an end to the suffering, hit all the airports. ” The official Syrian news agency’s account of the missile strike called it a “blatant act of aggression” by the United States that killed nine civilians, including four children, and caused “huge material damage. ” Russian news footage of the aftermath, posted on YouTube, showed damage to some reinforced hangars at Al Shayrat, but the runways appeared intact. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, reported later on Friday that two Sukhoi warplanes had been seen taking off from the base. The extent of damage could not be independently verified, but   activists felt some vindication regardless. “Homs is more beautiful without the airport of death,” Osama Mohammed Ali, a resident of a besieged area near Homs, said in a posted message. He urged the United States to launch “Tomahawks on all the airports of death, the airports of killing and extermination and displacement in Syria. ” Mohamed Khaldiyeh, an   activist who lives near the airfield, said residents had often awakened to audio alerts about impending takeoffs of warplanes on bombing missions. “This base was the main reason of the huge destruction in Homs and the displacements of our families,” he said, and on Friday, people “woke up to the news of its destruction. ” “Praise God,” he added. Syrians in other besieged parts of the country, learning about the American airstrike, reacted with a mix of gratification and worry. “The hit on Bashar   should have happened three years ago, from the beginning, when Bashar   used chemical weapons,” said Hala Abdulwahab, a teacher in Madaya, a besieged city. “Children are choking and dying. Entire families are dying. ” Wissam Zarqa, an English teacher from the northern city of Aleppo who now lives in Idlib Province, called the missile strike a positive step. But like others in Syria and elsewhere, he questioned whether it signaled the beginning of a stronger American military strategy in Syria. “One killing tool was targeted, which is good,” he said. “We hope more steps would follow to punish Assad for all attacks against civilians, whether chemical or not. ” Malek Al Shimali, an   activist displaced from his home in Aleppo a few months ago and now staying in Turkey, expressed mixed feelings about the missile strike. “I feel the ecstasy of revenge now,” he said in a Facebook message. But he added, “I don’t feel the strike will change anything  —   unless Bashar left, nothing will change. ”",0
20372,20372,Why Can’t My BFF and My New Boyfriend Get Along? - The New York Times,Philip Galanes,"I have been single for several years, and my best friend and I have come to count on each other for daily   frequent dinners and weekend plans  —   almost like a couple, but without the sex. Recently, I met a great guy, and we’ve been dating. I was really looking forward to introducing them. But it was a disaster. Later, he said, “She’s totally possessive of you and mean. ” She said, “He’s all wrong for you. ” I decided to give them a break from each other until I consulted with you. What should I do? K. B. NEW YORK A few weeks ago, I was riding shotgun with a friend in the country. Her    was strapped into his (much loathed) car seat in the back. It must have been the morning after prom. Because a   limo drove toward us and a teenage girl popped up through the sunroof  —   topless and whooping. My friend looked at her son anxiously. He said, “Mommy, that girl isn’t wearing her seatbelt. ” Perspective is everything  —   both for a little boy who is wrestled into his car seat every day and also for a BFF who fears that she is on the brink of losing her support system. Be patient. Start with two conversations, one with your boyfriend and another with your bestie. To him, explain the history and emotional heft of your long friendship. With your pal, try to reassure her that while things may change a little, you aren’t going anywhere. (No need to defend your taste in men.) Shut down any snark that they may offer with a simple: “He’s my boyfriend” or “She’s my best friend,” as needed. In a couple of weeks, try another dinner for three (or four, if your boyfriend has a pal). Be direct in demanding kindness from both of them. In my experience, it will take about twice as long as you think it should for everyone to acclimate to the new arrangement. Change is scary. A new staff member at an office I visit regularly is of a gender I cannot identify. It is not my business, and I don’t care. But I would like to be able to address this person with civility and good manners. “Sir” and “ma’am” have a 50 percent chance of being wrong and possibly causing offense. I’ve decided to ask this person how he or she would like to be addressed. How should I phrase the question? ANONYMOUS You shouldn’t. Simply revert to the second sentence of your question (with a Social Q’s proviso): this person’s gender is, indeed, not your business, and allegedly you don’t care about it. What possible difference does it make in the context of visiting an office occasionally? Pinning down a person’s gender has no more to do with civility than fixing their race or age. Just smile and say, “Hello. ” If your contact is more substantive, introduce yourself. “Nice to meet you. I’m Wolfgang Mozart. ” Like magic, this other creature will then pour forth his or her name. I have a serious medical condition that is addressed with a very low sodium diet. This is not a preference it is medical necessity. When we are invited to dinners, some friends have made   meals and allowed salt lovers to add salt to their hearts’ content. But recently, I told a host about my issue, and she responded,“I am making ribs with a rub containing salt. ” I almost told her that I’d eat before I came. How should I properly address this? ROBERTA I’d say you are doing a great job already, by communicating directly with your dinner hosts beforehand. Some will rethink their menus to suit your medical issue others will make sure that a few offerings comply and still others will let you know that the (true) impetus of the evening is a desire to make those ribs they saw in Bon Appétit. All three types of host are behaving just fine. And you can decide to attend (or not) based on your preference. Hosts have a responsibility to make their guests feel comfortable in their homes, not to become   cooks for us. If the   chef also serves a green salad and cornbread, it’s not as if you are going to die of starvation, correct? My husband and I are well off. We like to go out to dinner with friends, and sometimes we pick up the check. Always (seriously, always) our friends thank my husband, but not me. I think they should thank both of us because we are married and our money is shared. So far, I’ve kept my mouth shut. What’s your advice? L. M. Next time, pay with your credit card, and watch your guests thank you for treating them. (Just a hunch.) Your point about shared finances may be true for most married couples, and I tend to thank both partners when one pays for my dinner. But for sure, the one who whips out the credit card will always be thanked.",0

20374,20374,Second Avenue Subway’s Arrival Brings Fear That Rents Will Soar - The New York Times,Emma G. Fitzsimmons,"Few cities in the world are as closely linked to their subways as New York City  —   the vast network helped shape the city and now carries nearly six million people a day. So when the most ambitious expansion of the subway system in half a century opens on Sunday, it will be a transformative moment, promising to alter the future of a large slice of Manhattan. The new Second Avenue subway will provide badly needed relief to one of New York’s most congested transit corridors and is expected to be a boon to the local economy, making restaurants and stores suddenly easier to reach. But even as the city celebrates a line many doubted would ever open, its arrival has prompted fears that rising rents could force out longtime residents and shops  —   the kind of displacement that has swept through many other parts of an increasingly affluent New York and deepened its inequality. People living near three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets could face rent increases as high as $462 per month, according to a report by StreetEasy, a real estate website. Sleek   are already popping up above the   apartment buildings that have served as first homes for many New Yorkers. One of those is Dina Zingaro, who gravitated to the neighborhood when she moved from New Jersey. She and a roommate pay $2, 400 a month for a   apartment on the fifth floor of a   building. While the new line will shorten her trip to work, she worries that it could also bring a major rent increase and ultimately push her out of Manhattan. “If it was over $200, that would be tough,” she said. “We’d have to consider moving. ” Once a German enclave where elevated trains ran above Second and Third Avenues, the Yorkville neighborhood on the Upper East Side is now home to millennials looking for a deal, families drawn by good schools and older people with limited budgets. Rowdy bars with beer pong games exist alongside hordes of strollers. On its eastern border sits the verdant but    way Carl Schurz Park and Gracie Mansion, the mayoral estate, whose current resident, Bill de Blasio, prefers to use chauffeured cars over the   subway. The elevated lines were razed in the 1940s and 1950s, to the delight of many residents who viewed them as noisy eyesores and expected a new subway line to open soon. Instead, the area became a   desert, one of the few neighborhoods in Manhattan that the subway did not reach. But this has also made the neighborhood relatively affordable by Manhattan standards. Yorkville’s median rent is about $2, 700 per month, lower than Manhattan’s rate of about $3, 300, according to StreetEasy, and there are clusters of   and   apartments. A real estate wave seemed forever around the corner as plans for the subway line were delayed again and again. Until now, residents have been forced to trek blocks to the nearest packed subway stops to board No. 4, 5 and 6 trains on Lexington Avenue, the nation’s   subway line. The first phase of the new line, which cost about $4. 4 billion, is opening at a critical moment, with subway ridership reaching its highest level since 1948. The flood of riders has led to uncomfortable crowding and increasing train delays, while people who choose to drive or take the bus face intensifying gridlock. Since the subway first opened in Manhattan in 1904 and expanded farther into the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, it has paved the way for development, and it propelled the city’s soaring population in the first half of the 20th century. But in recent decades, the system has largely remained the same size, even as the city’s population of 8. 5 million is the highest ever and continues to climb. The city’s first new subway station in a   opened at Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan in 2015, but that was only one stop and the formerly industrial neighborhood was largely a blank slate for developers. The Second Avenue line is a different story, traversing an already dense neighborhood, and the full economic impact is not yet clear. Local businesses are bracing for steep rent increases. Peter Psirakis, the owner of a shoe repair shop on Second Avenue near 70th Street, worries that his rent each month, now more than $6, 000, could rise by thousands of dollars. He would likely have to shut his store when his lease ended in a couple of years. “I’m here 23 years,” he said. “I can’t go to another neighborhood and start a business from the beginning. ” At the same time, though, many restaurants and shops are also eagerly anticipating the return of foot traffic many people avoided the area when construction of the subway line began in 2007. Tunnel blasting rattled buildings, broke windows and produced noise and dust. Local business leaders held a news conference recently on Second Avenue with Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat who represents the area and is a longtime supporter of the project, to praise the anticipated economic stimulus. Even before the first train rolls, the area’s housing market has been heating up. New condos have risen on First and Second Avenues, with sales topping $2 million for a   apartment. In the last five years, median rents near Second Avenue have grown by 27 percent to about $2, 520 per month, according to StreetEasy. Many of the same concerns over gentrification could arise as the line is ultimately extended uptown to 125th Street in East Harlem. “Displacement is a real concern,” said Thomas K. Wright, the president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group. “When you increase the values in areas like this, you need to do things to protect affordable housing and retail. ” He said officials should consider a host of policies to keep the neighborhood within reach, including securing affordable housing as part of any zoning changes. A lifelong resident of the neighborhood, Carol McCabe moved to Knickerbocker Plaza on Second Avenue in 1975. Ms. McCabe, 67, who runs a senior center in the complex, is struggling to pay her rising rent of about $3, 000 per month after her husband died, and might eventually have to leave New York. “I’m not so certain about the future,” she said. “I’m worried about my apartment. ” Even Yorkville’s city councilman, Ben Kallos, 35, who grew up in the neighborhood, is weighing how he and his wife can afford to stay in the district. He said there was little he could do to slow rising rents. “Where I have to place much of my focus is on helping   tenants stay in their apartment and exercise their rights,” said Mr. Kallos, a Democrat who has also pushed to set a height limit on   superscrapers in the neighborhoods he represents. Austin Finan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said the administration’s top priority remained protecting affordable housing and building new units. “We pursue that goal in every neighborhood in the city, including on the Upper East Side,” Mr. Finan said. Across the United States, good transit access often leads to higher real estate prices, with home values near rapid transit in Boston, Chicago,  . Paul, Phoenix and San Francisco far outpacing other properties during the last recession, according to a report by the American Public Transportation Association. But New York City is a special case, where proximity to the subway is perhaps the most important factor for renters and buyers. Just look at the recent panic in trendy Williamsburg, Brooklyn, over the impending shutdown of the L line for more than a year. Still, the Upper East Side is unlikely to become suddenly hip, said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University. “The neighborhood is intrinsically boring,” Mr. Moss said. “People don’t live there for excitement. They live there for stability. ” Some predict an influx of   shops and more chain stores, even as shuttered storefronts along Second Avenue highlight the places that closed rather than wait out the disruptive construction. Dave Goodside kept the Beach Cafe restaurant open, borrowing money, laying off employees and sometimes working nonstop to remain afloat. A sign in the dining room is a reminder of the tumultuous construction era: “One long whistle: Preparing to blast. ” Mr. Goodside expects his rent will soon rise sharply. “What we talk about all the time,” he said, “is how we can increase business and be ready for that day. ”",0
20375,20375,Women Suspected in Killing of Kim Jong-nam Are Charged - The New York Times,Richard C. Paddock and Choe Sang-Hun,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia  —   Two women were charged with murder in a Kuala Lumpur court on Wednesday in connection with the assassination of Kim   the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader, Kim  . Siti Aisyah, 25, of Indonesia, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, of Vietnam, could receive the death penalty. The police said the two women rubbed a deadly nerve agent on Mr. Kim’s face as he prepared to check in for a flight at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on the morning of Feb. 13. The women were charged as North Korea began a diplomatic effort to repair the damage from the killing, sending delegations to Beijing and Kuala Lumpur in a rare bit of outreach by the reclusive nation as it faced accusations that it had carried out the brazen assassination. The delegation to Beijing was led by Vice Foreign Minister Ri   said the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, which did not provide further details. The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed that Mr. Ri was visiting at its invitation and would meet with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi. Mr. Ri is the most senior North Korean official to visit Beijing since a delegation met with President Xi Jinping of China in May. His trip came five days after the North lashed out at China in unusually bitter language for tightening sanctions by suspending all coal imports from North Korea for the rest of the year, depriving North Korea of one of its most important sources of hard currency. The two women charged in Mr. Kim’s murder were arrested soon after the Feb. 13 attack and have said they thought they were participating in a prank. The police have also arrested a North Korean man, Ri   and are seeking seven others. South Korean officials have accused the North Korean government of ordering the assassination. There was no word yet on whether Malaysian officials would charge Ri   in the attack. With relations between Malaysia and North Korea fraying over the killing, a   North Korean delegation, including the former deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Ri   arrived in the Malaysian capital to discuss taking Mr. Kim’s body to North Korea, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported from Kuala Lumpur. Ri   the envoy, said he also would demand the release of Ri   Yonhap reported. “We are here to discuss human rights issues and find an agreement,” Mr. Ri told reporters outside the North Korean Embassy. North Korea is widely considered to have one of the world’s worst human rights records, one that includes enslavement and torture of political prisoners, extrajudicial executions and forced abortions. Mr. Ri also said he would discuss “strengthening friendly relations” with Malaysia. Whether Malaysia is prepared to discuss friendly relations remains to be seen. Officials at the Malaysian Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the standoff over the release of the body and the detention of the North Korean suspect.",0

20377,20377,The Adults a Medicaid Work Requirement Would Leave Behind - The New York Times,Abby Goodnough,"JACKSONVILLE, Ark.  —   On a frigid morning here, Nancy Godinez was piling bread and other staples into her car outside a food pantry. She had lost her job as a custodian, her unemployment checks had run out, and her job search had proved fruitless. One thing she still had was health insurance, acquired three years ago after Arkansas’   legislature agreed to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The coverage, she said, has allowed her to get regular checkups and treatment for tendinitis in her foot. But unless she finds a new job, Ms. Godinez, 55, could be at risk of losing her insurance, too. Gov. Asa Hutchinson is among a number of Republican governors hoping to impose a work requirement on Medicaid recipients. They believe that extending Medicaid to millions of   adults without disabilities under the health law gave them an incentive not to work. Since its creation as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society agenda in the 1960s, Medicaid has grown to become a robust safety net program for poor Americans, providing health care for 74 million people. The new Republican ideas for the program, including work requirements and changes in how it is paid for, could make Medicaid much more limited, with a smaller impact on the federal budget but more obstacles to becoming and staying enrolled. The outline of a new replacement plan, presented to House members last week, shows just how far some Republican leaders hope to go in overhauling a program that has grown under the Affordable Care Act to insure one in five Americans, including more than half of the roughly 20 million people who have gained coverage under the health law. It would give each state a fixed amount of money for each Medicaid beneficiary, instead of paying a large share of whatever it costs to cover everyone who qualifies. And it would substantially reduce the amount that the federal government pays to help cover the Medicaid expansion in Arkansas and 30 other states, a change that would most likely result in many people losing coverage. In return, states would get far more freedom to structure their Medicaid programs as they wished. Now, even as divisions among Republicans in Congress slow efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Hutchinson and other Republican governors are developing proposals to require many Medicaid recipients to have a job, participate in job training or perform community service. “It gives dignity it gives responsibility,” Mr. Hutchinson said in a recent interview at the State Capitol. “And if somebody wants to say, ‘That’s not for me,’ if they’re   they ought to be kicked off the system. ” Work requirements have long been central to the Republican goal of instilling a sense of “personal responsibility” in people who benefit from government programs. But it was an Arkansas Democrat, Bill Clinton, whose embrace of work requirements for welfare recipients when he was governor became the basis for the 1996 federal welfare law enacted during his presidency. In fact, 59 percent of nondisabled adults on Medicaid do have jobs, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But advocates for the poor say   people often face numerous roadblocks in finding work. Some have criminal records. Others lack a cellphone or reliable transportation, said Mandy Davis, a social worker at Jericho Way, a resource center for the homeless in Little Rock. “  America believes in work because we do it ourselves,” Ms. Davis said. “But we have resources, an education, transportation, a supportive family. ” Mr. Hutchinson and a few other governors, including those in Arizona, Indiana and Montana, have already sought work or   requirements for those who received Medicaid under the expansion over the last few years but were rebuffed by the Obama administration. President Barack Obama would allow them only to refer Medicaid recipients to   programs, with no requirement that they participate. One early indication of the Trump administration’s stance will be whether it approves Kentucky’s request to require   Medicaid recipients to either work, enroll in school, get job training or volunteer 20 hours a week. Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, submitted the request last year. President Trump’s nominee to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, a health policy consultant, helped with the proposal. Ms. Verma has also helped other Republican states push for, and in some cases win approval of, new rules for Medicaid enrollees, including charging them premiums and temporarily revoking coverage from those who fail to pay the premiums. It was Mr. Hutchinson’s Democratic predecessor, Mike Beebe, who got the state’s   legislature to expand Medicaid by using federal funds to buy private insurance for the poor. Mr. Hutchinson said in the interview that he wanted to continue the expansion here, but that if the federal government stopped paying most of the cost as the health law requires, “we’ll just have to look at it again. ” He said he would either seek the Trump administration’s permission to impose a work requirement or seek a block grant  —   and, with it, leeway to create new rules  —   to cover those who newly qualified for Medicaid under the health law. As a rough model, Mr. Hutchinson pointed to a work requirement for certain food stamp recipients  —   a federal policy that was part of the landmark 1996 welfare overhaul  —   that Arkansas reinstated last year. Under that rule,   adults without dependents cannot receive food stamps for longer than three months unless they are working, volunteering or getting job training for 20 hours a week. States were allowed to suspend the requirement during the recession, but most have brought it back as unemployment has dropped. It generally applies to adults ages 18 to 49 unless they are pregnant, have dependent children or are medically certified as “unfit for employment. ” Since Arkansas reimposed the work requirement last year, its food stamp rolls have lost about 36, 000 people, according to the State Department of Human Services. Mr. Hutchinson said the drop was partly explained because people had found jobs, but advocates for the poor said many appeared to have been cut off. For now, Arkansas is sending letters to Medicaid enrollees to let them know they are eligible for “free job search assistance,” including career counseling and help writing résumés. The state is putting together a system to keep track of those who take advantage of the offer and whether they end up finding jobs. Many Medicaid recipients here already have   jobs, but roughly 40 percent report having no income, according to the state. “If you look at the statute, it is one of the purposes of Medicaid to help people attain independence and ” said Dennis Smith, senior adviser for Medicaid and health care reform at the Arkansas Department of Human Services and a Medicare and Medicaid director under President George W. Bush. But Leonardo Cuello, director of health policy for the National Health Law Program in Washington, said work requirements for Medicaid recipients would very likely be challenged in court. “Applying work requirements to health coverage gets it exactly backward,” he said. “An individual needs to be healthy to work, and a work requirement may prevent them from getting the health care they need in order to be able to work. ” Christopher Caveney, 38, of Blytheville, recently found   work as a security guard after a long recovery from surgery to remove a benign tumor in his spine. Mr. Caveney has Medicaid coverage but lost his food stamps last fall because he was not working the required 20 hours a week. “I went from being able to eat vegetables to eating Hamburger Helper every day,” said Mr. Caveney, who earns $10 an hour. “I think most people want to work, but I also know a lot of people work when it’s not necessarily in their health’s best interest. ” Mr. Cuello also said it would be difficult for states to determine which of their Medicaid enrollees were truly capable of work. Someone may be legitimately disabled but not yet approved for disability benefits, for example. That is the case with Jimmy T. Brunson, 44, whose diabetes has caused painful neuropathy in his feet. Mr. Brunson, who was playing dominoes one recent morning at Jericho Way, a resource center for the homeless, said he sporadically found temporary jobs but had a hard time keeping them because of the pain in his feet. Mr. Brunson said he had qualified for Medicaid under the health law and was using it to get his diabetes medication. If a work requirement was imposed, “I’d probably be out,” he said. “Even though sometimes I can get a job, you’ve got to understand  —   sometimes I can’t even walk. ” Daniel   a Medicaid recipient who makes a modest income singing at churches around Little Rock, said he worried that a work requirement would reduce the Medicaid rolls without connecting many people to jobs or training. “Are these   centers going to be robustly funded and have the means to identify prospective employers and make matches happen?” asked Mr.   29, who is also a graduate student at the University of Arkansas. “I worry that this is all for show. ” But even some of Arkansas’ poorest residents are quick to say public benefits should be conditioned on work. “I’m glad we have it, but people should have to do something for it,” said Ms. Godinez, who had stopped by the Fishnet Missions Food Pantry in Jacksonville, outside Little Rock. “This is America, right? You’re supposed to work for what you get. ” Some who make a living helping the poor also said they were strongly against providing a public benefit to those who are physically able to work but do not. “If you’re of able mind and body, you should be able to make something happen for yourself,” said Edward Brown, the daily operations manager at Stewpot, a soup kitchen in Little Rock. “But some people just don’t want to work  —   they’re too taken care of. ” Dewey Sims, the founder and chief executive of Fishnet Missions, which runs the food pantry here, agreed. “I ain’t got no damn entitlement,” he said. “I earned everything I got. ”",0

20379,20379,"Students Denounced as ’Racist’ For Wearing Red, White and Blue Clothing at Basketball Game - Breitbart",Warner Todd Huston,"Students at an Iowa high school have been criticized for wearing red, white, and blue clothing to a recent basketball game with some calling the patriotic colors “racist. ”[As they have done several times in the past, students at Valley High from Des Moines, Iowa, organized a U. S. A. colors day and wore red, white, and blue and U. S.   clothing to last week’s game against North High School.  But the effort was deemed “controversial” by members of North High because their school has a “diverse” student body. “A lot of people were very upset about it,” North sophomore DeNasja Spencer told CBS affiliate KCCI TV. “Even if that was their theme for the game, I feel like they should have switched that because everyone knows North is a more diverse school,” she added. On Facebook, a Valley High alum named Ty Leggett slammed the students. “This is an example of BLATANT racism,” he wrote. “ALL participating should have been pulled and banned from ALL VHS extracurricular events for the remainder of the year! As a parent, I’d be mortified that my son or daughter thought this way, acted in this fashion and refrained from taking a stand against this 21st century inexcusable behavior!” Des Moines North coach Chad Ryan claimed he didn’t want to “judge those young people not knowing their motive,” but went on to say, “It’s been good for us, as a school. They learn from each other about people with different cultures and backgrounds  —   and we try to use it as an educational piece. ” This isn’t the first time Valley has sponsored a patriotic day. Valley High fans reportedly wore patriotic colors during a football game against rival Dowling Catholic this year as well. “We had a USA theme, which we’ve done many times in the past,” Valley freshman Dayna Dunnwald told the media. “It’s really sad, and I hope everyone can resolve it in the end because no one at Valley meant it in that way. And it was just for fun. ” Another student, Melissa   was disgusted by the attacks on her school, “Now we can’t wear USA stuff without making someone upset? Oh please  …    . ” Despite the past patriotic events, Valley High School’s student leadership members apologized to North High’s principal. “It has been brought to our attention that the decision by the Valley High School student section to wear U. S. A. apparel at our game last night was offensive to members of your community and fan base,” the student letter read. “We are deeply sorry if we have offended anyone in any way. We have traditionally dressed in such a fashion for great games such as the one last night. Everyone here at Valley has immense respect not only for your team and players but for your community as a whole. Please know that our intent was in no way to offend or demean —  just to support our own team in a way we have done before. ” Valley High’s Tigers ended up defeating the Des Moines North Polar Bears  .

20380,20380,"Walter Hautzig, Pianist Whose Talent Helped Him Flee Nazis, Dies at 95 - The New York Times",Sam Roberts,"Music was not only Walter Hautzig’s vocation. It also won over the young woman who would become his wife. And it saved his life. Mr. Hautzig, a concert pianist who escaped from   Vienna as a teenager armed with a fellowship from the Jerusalem Conservatory and went on to become a touring musical   ambassador, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 95. The cause was congestive heart failure, his daughter, Deborah Hautzig, said. Only five years after he blustered his way into an audition with the conservatory’s director in 1938, the    Mr. Hautzig made his American debut at Town Hall in New York with an ambitious program of Bach, Beethoven and Chopin. A reviewer for The New York Times said it “augured a brilliant career. ” Years later, Mr. Hautzig recalled, “My father said I should be a doctor or a lawyer, but after Town Hall, he never left the house without the New York Times review in his pocket. ” Mr. Hautzig (pronounced  ) won the 1943 Town Hall Endowment Series Award for best young artist that year. He later became a cultural ambassador for the United States, performing around the world for three decades. In the 1950s he performed frequently in Japan under State Department sponsorship. In 1979, after relations thawed, he was the first American artist officially delegated to perform in mainland China. “Beethoven and Chopin are as good for the Asians as for the Europeans as for the Jews as for the gentiles,” he told The Forward in 2007. He refused, however, to perform before a racially segregated audience in Alabama in the 1940s. “He told the concert manager, ‘You’re as bad as the Nazis! ’” Ms. Hautzig, his daughter, recalled in her eulogy at his funeral on Thursday. “They said, ‘Go back where you came from. ’” While music affected Mr. Hautzig profoundly, the instrument that spared him from Nazi persecution and led to his marriage entered his personal life serendipitously. “His father had had a big success in his business and told my grandmother she had two choices: She could have a fur coat, or she could have a piano,” Ms. Hautzig said in her eulogy. “She chose the piano. ” Her father began playing it when he was 4. Walter Hautzig was born on Sept. 28, 1921, in Vienna to the former Rosa Zwim and David Hautzig, a bookbinder. He studied at the Vienna Academy of Music until the German annexation of Austria capped a period of growing   there, during which he was arrested at least once and also forced to scrub streets on his knees. “They made the world believe that they were Hitler’s first victims, but Hitler’s army was received with kisses,” he said of Austrians. When the music academy was shuttered and seized by German soldiers, he practiced the piano on his own at home. “I said to myself, ‘This they can never take away from me,’” he recalled in a documentary filmed by his granddaughter Molly DeVries. Responding to an advertisement in a Jewish newspaper, he arrived at a Vienna hotel at 8 a. m. to audition for Emil Hauser, director of the Jerusalem Conservatory and a founder of the Budapest String Quartet. Mr. Hauser was not just offering fellowships he was also offering exit visas. Mr. Hauser finally surfaced at 2 p. m. and apologized, saying he had had to rush to another appointment. Audaciously, Mr. Hautzig joined him in a taxi, and when they arrived at a private apartment that happened to have a piano, Mr. Hauser pointed to it and said, “Spiel!” (“Play! ”) Mr. Hautzig performed Beethoven’s “Waldstein” Sonata. “When I finished playing,” Mr. Hautzig said, “he exclaimed, ‘No matter what it takes, I will make sure that you come to Jerusalem. ’” A month later he arrived in what was then Palestine, where he studied under Josef Tal and Alfred Schroeder and performed as a soloist with the Jerusalem Academy Orchestra. After a year and a half, he joined his parents and sister, who had fled through Switzerland, in New York. He studied privately with Artur Schnabel and enrolled in the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He was later a professor of piano at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, from 1960 to 1988. He continued to perform until a few years ago. Returning from Scandinavia, where he performed to raise money for war victims of the Nazis, he met Esther Rudomin. She was on her way to New York from Siberia, where her family had been exiled. She was 16 and seasick. “I played for her the G minor Ballade of Chopin,” Mr. Hautzig said, “and she said, ‘Anybody who plays like that has to be good. ’” They married in 1950. Esther Hautzig, who became an author of children’s books, died in 2009. In addition to his daughter, Mr. Hautzig is survived by a son, David, and three grandchildren. The Hautzigs lived in an Upper West Side apartment building, and Mrs. Hautzig once cited the unique challenges that urban acoustics posed for a professional musician. “A neighbor called and said, ‘Mrs. Hautzig, your husband’s practicing is driving me crazy,’” she recalled. “I gulped and apologized. The neighbor interrupted my apologies: ‘No, what’s he practicing? I know the piece and can’t remember what it is! ’”",0

20383,20383,Generation Adderall - The New York Times,Casey Schwartz,"Have you ever been to Enfield? I had never even heard of it until I was 23 and living in London for graduate school. One afternoon, I received notification that a package whose arrival I had been anticipating for days had been bogged down in customs and was now in a FedEx warehouse in Enfield, an unremarkable London suburb. I was outside my flat within minutes of receiving this news and on the train to Enfield within the hour, staring through the window at the gray sky. The package in question, sent from Los Angeles, contained my monthly supply of Adderall. Adderall, the brand name for a mixture of amphetamine salts, is more strictly regulated in Britain than in the United States, where, the year before, in 2005, I became one of the millions of Americans to be prescribed a stimulant medication. The train to Enfield was hardly the greatest extreme to which I would go during the decade I was entangled with Adderall. I would open other people’s medicine cabinets, root through trash cans where I had previously disposed of pills, write friends’ college essays for barter. Once, while living in New Hampshire, I skipped a day of work to drive three hours each way to the health clinic where my prescription was still on file. Never was I more resourceful or unswerving than when I was devising ways to secure more Adderall. Adderall is prescribed to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, a neurobehavioral condition marked by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that was first included in the D. S. M. in 1987 and predominantly seen in children. That condition, which has also been called Attention Deficit Disorder, has been increasingly diagnosed over recent decades: In the 1990s, an estimated 3 to 5 percent of   American children were believed to have A. D. H. D. according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by 2013, that figure was 11 percent. It continues to rise. And the increase in diagnoses has been followed by an increase in prescriptions. In 1990, 600, 000 children were on stimulants, usually Ritalin, an older medication that often had to be taken multiple times a day. By 2013, 3. 5 million children were on stimulants, and in many cases, the Ritalin had been replaced by Adderall, officially brought to market in 1996 as the new, upgraded choice for A. D. H. D.  —   more effective, longer lasting. Adderall’s very name reflects its makers’ hopes for an expanding customer base: “A. D. D. for all” is the phrase that inspired it, Alan Schwarz writes in his new book, “A. D. H. D. Nation. ” And in fact, by the time I arrived at college in 2000, four years after Adderall hit the market, nearly five million prescriptions were written in 2005, the year after I graduated, that number was just under nine million. By then, sales of A. D. H. D. medication in the United States totaled more than $2 billion. By the   adults were the   group receiving the drug. In 2012, roughly 16 million Adderall prescriptions were written for adults between ages 20 and 39, according to QuintilesIMS, an     company that gathers    data. Adderall has now become ubiquitous on college campuses, widely taken by students both with and without a prescription. Black markets have sprung up at many, if not most, schools. In fact, according to a review published in 2012 in the journal Brain and Behavior, the   use of prescription stimulants had come to represent the    form of illicit drug use in college by 2004. Only marijuana was more popular. We know very little about what Adderall does over years of use, in and out of college, throughout all the experiences that constitute early adulthood. To date, there is almost no research on the   effects on humans of using Adderall. In a sense, then, we are the walking experiment, those of us around my age who first got involved with this drug in high school or college when it was suddenly everywhere and then did not manage to get off it for years afterward  —   if we got off it at all. We are living out what it might mean, both psychologically and neurologically, to take a powerful drug we do not need over long stretches of time. Sometimes I think of us as Generation Adderall. Adderall as we know it today owes its origins to accident. In the late 1920s, an American chemist named Gordon Alles, searching for a treatment for asthma, synthesized a substance related to adrenaline, which was known to aid bronchial relaxation. Alles had created    the chemical now known as amphetamine. Injecting himself to test the results, he noted a “feeling of well being,” followed by a “rather sleepless night,” according to “On Speed: The Many Lives of Amphetamine,” by Nicolas Rasmussen. By the 1930s, the drug Benzedrine, a   amphetamine, was being taken to elevate mood, boost energy and increase vigilance. The American military dispensed Benzedrine tablets, also known as “go pills,” to soldiers during World War II. After the war, with slight modification, an amphetamine called Dexedrine was prescribed to treat depression. Many people, especially women, loved amphetamines for their   side effects and took them to stay thin, often in the form of the diet drug Obetrol. But in the early 1970s, with around 10 million adults using amphetamines, the Food and Drug Administration stepped in with strict regulations, and the drug fell out of such common use. More than 20 years later, a pharmaceutical executive named Roger Griggs thought to revisit the now largely forgotten Obetrol. Tweaking the formula, he named it Adderall and brought it to market aimed at the millions of children and teenagers who doctors said had A. D. H. D. A   version of Adderall came out a few years later, which prolonged the delivery of the drug to the bloodstream and which was said to be less addictive  —   and therefore easier to walk away from. In theory. The first time I took Adderall, I was a sophomore at Brown University, lamenting to a friend the impossibility of my plight: a   paper due the next afternoon on a book I had only just begun reading. “Do you want an Adderall?” she asked. “I can’t stand it  —   it makes me want to stay up all night doing cartwheels in the hallway. ” Could there be a more enticing description? My friend pulled two blue pills out of tinfoil and handed them to me. An hour later, I was in the basement of the library, hunkered down in the Absolute Quiet Room, in a state of peerless ecstasy. The world fell away it was only me, locked in a passionate embrace with the book I was reading and the thoughts I was having about it, which tumbled out of nowhere and built into what seemed an amazing pile of riches. When dawn came to Providence, R. I. I was hunched over in the grubby lounge of my dormitory, typing my last fevered perceptions, vaguely aware that outside the window, the sky was turning pink. I was alone in my new secret world, and that very aloneness was part of the great intoxication. I needed nothing and no one. I would experience this same sensation again and again over the next two years, whenever I could get my hands on Adderall on campus, which was frequently, but not, I began to feel, frequently enough. My Adderall hours became the most precious hours of my life, far too precious for the Absolute Quiet Room. I now needed to locate the most remote desk in the darkest, most neglected corner of the   stacks, tucked farthest from the humming campus life going on outside. That life was no longer the life that interested me. Instead, what mattered, what compelled, were the hours I spent in isolation, poring over, for instance, Immanuel Kant’s thoughts on “the sublime. ” It was fitting: This was sublime, these afternoons I spent in untrammeled focus, absorbing the complicated ideas in the texts in front of me, mastering them, covering their every surface with my   comprehension, devouring them, making them a part of myself. Or rather, of what I now thought of as my self, which is to say, the steely, undistractable person whom I vastly preferred to the lazier, glitchier person I knew my actual self to be, the one who was subject to fits of lassitude and a tendency to eat too many Swedish Fish. Adderall wiped away the question of willpower. Now I could study all night, then run 10 miles, then breeze through that week’s New Yorker, all without pausing to consider whether I might prefer to chat with classmates or go to the movies. It was fantastic. I lost weight. That was nice, too. Though I did snap at friends, abruptly accessing huge depths of fury I wouldn’t have thought I possessed. When a roommate went home one weekend and forgot to turn off her alarm clock so that it beeped behind her locked door for 48 hours, I entirely lost control, calling her in New York to berate her. I didn’t know how long it had been since I’d slept more than five hours. Why bother? By my senior year of college, my school work had grown more unmanageable, not less. For the first time in my life, I wasn’t able to complete it. My droll, aristocratic   professor granted me an extension on the final term paper. One Friday evening well into December, when the idyllic New England campus had already begun to empty out for winter break, I was alone in the Sciences Library  —   the one that stayed open all night  —   squinting down at my notes on the Russian intelligentsia. Outside, it was blizzarding. Inside, the fluorescent lights beat down on the empty   room. I felt dizzy and strange. It had been a particularly chemical week several days had passed since I had slept more than a handful of hours, and I was taking more and more pills to compensate. Suddenly, when I looked up from the page, the bright room seemed to dilate around me, as if I weren’t really there but rather stuck in some strange mirage. I seized with panic  —   what was happening? I tried to breathe, to snap myself back into reality, but I couldn’t. Shakily, I stood and made my way toward the phones. I dialed my friend Dave in his dorm room. “I’m having some kind of problem in the Sci Li,” I told him. My own voice sounded as if it belonged to someone else. An hour later, I was in an ambulance, being taken through the snowstorm to the nearest hospital. The volunteer E. M. T. was a Brown student I’d met once or twice. He held my hand the whole way. “Am I going to die?” I kept asking him. Dave and I sat for hours in the emergency room, until I was ushered behind a curtain and a   doctor came in to see me. I wasn’t used to being looked at the way he was looking at me, which is to say, as if I were potentially insane, certifiable even. By then, I was feeling a little better, no longer so sure I was dying, and as I lay down on the examination table, I joked to him, “I will recline, like the Romans!” His expression remained unamused. I described what I’d been taking. His diagnosis: “Anxiety, amphetamine induced. ” I had had my first panic attack  —   an uncommon but by no means unknown reaction to taking too much Adderall. When I left the hospital, I left behind the canister of blue pills that I had painstakingly scrounged together. I still remember the sight of it sitting next to the examination bed. A few days later, I drew incompletes in my classes and went back home to New York. My father knew about the hospital incident, but I promised him I would stop taking the drug. And I fully intended to. I spent that long winter break at the public library on 42nd Street, soldiering lethargically through the essays I hadn’t been able to cope with while taking amphetamines. What I didn’t know then, what I couldn’t have known, was that the question of whether Adderall actually improves cognitive performance when taken    —   whether or not it is a “smart drug”  —   was unresolved. It would be another few years before studies appeared showing that Adderall’s effect on cognitive enhancement is more than a little ambiguous. Martha Farah, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania, has conducted much of this research. She has studied the effect of Adderall on subjects taking a host of standardized tests that measure restraint, memory and creativity. On balance, Farah and others have found very little to no improvement when their research subjects confront these tests on Adderall. Ultimately, she says, it is possible that “  people actually do improve on the drug, and   people show no improvement or actually get worse. ” My   period didn’t last very long. I turned in my incomplete school work and duly received my grades, but by graduation that spring, I was again locked into the familiar pattern, the blissful intensity and isolation followed by days of   comedown, when I would laze around for hours, eating spoonfuls of ice cream from the carton, desperate for the sugar rush, barely able to muster the energy necessary to take a shower. It took me exactly one year from the time of college graduation to come to the decision that would, to a great extent, shape the next phase of my life. It hit me like a revelation: It might be possible to declare my independence from the various A. D. H. D. kids who sold me their prescription pills at exorbitant markups and get a prescription all my own. The idea occurred to me as I walked among the palm trees on the campus of U. C. L. A. By then, I was living in Los Angeles, working as a private tutor for   kids, many of whom were themselves on Adderall, and taking   classes in psychology and neuroscience in order to be able to apply for graduate school. I had decided I wanted to be a psychologist  —   infinitely more manageable than my secret ambition of being a writer, I thought. Infinitely more realistic. Like many   my decisions were informed by panic and haste, but also, of course, by whatever   supply of the pills I happened to be in possession of. I was now surrounded  —   or had surrounded myself  —   by others caught up in the Adderall web. Together with two of my closest friends in Los Angeles that year, we traversed the city in a state of perpetual,   intensity, exchanging confidences that later we would not recall. Adderall was the currency of our friendship when one of us ran short of pills, another would cover the deficit. Driving through Los Angeles in a   trance, weaving in and out of traffic, I found it all too easy to lose track of exactly how many pills I had swallowed that day. As soon as it occurred to me that I might be able to get my own prescription, I went to the nearest campus computer and searched for “cognitive behavioral psychiatrist, Westwood, Los Angeles, California. ” I knew enough about psychology by then to avoid the psychoanalysts, who would want to go deep and talk to me for weeks or maybe months about why I felt I needed chemical enhancement. No, I couldn’t turn to them  —   I needed a therapist with an M. D. a focus on concrete “results” and an office within a   drive of U. C. L. A. The very next day, I was sitting in exactly the kind of place I had envisioned, an impersonal room with gray walls and black leather furniture, describing to the attractive young psychiatrist in the chair opposite me how I had always had to develop elaborate compensatory strategies for getting through my school work, how staying with any one thing was a challenge for me, how I was best at jobs that required elaborate multitasking, like waitressing. Untrue, all of it. I was a focused student and a terrible waitress. And yet these were the answers that I discovered from the briefest online research were characteristic of the A. D. H. D. diagnostic criteria. These were the answers they were looking for in order to pick up their pens and write down “Adderall, 20 mg, once a day” on their prescription pads. So these were the answers I gave. Fifty minutes later, I was standing on San Vicente Boulevard in the bright California sun, prescription slip in hand. That single doctor’s assessment, granted in less than an hour, would follow me everywhere I went: through the rest of my time in Los Angeles then off to London, with the help of FedEx then to New Haven, where I would pick it up once a month at the Yale Health Center then back to New York, where the doctor I found on my insurance plan would have no problem continuing to prescribe this medication, based only on my saying that it had been previously prescribed to me, that I’d been taking it for years. Any basic neuroscience textbook will explain how Adderall works in the brain  —   and why it’s so hard to break the habit. For years, the predominant explanation of addiction, promulgated by researchers like Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, has revolved around the neurotransmitter dopamine. Amphetamines unleash dopamine along with norepinephrine, which rush through the brain’s synapses and increase levels of arousal, attention, vigilance and motivation. Dopamine, in fact, tends to feature in every experience that feels especially great, be it having sex or eating chocolate cake. It’s for this reason that dopamine is so heavily implicated in current models of addiction. As a person begins to overuse a substance, the brain  —   which craves homeostasis and fights for it  —   tries to compensate for all the extra dopamine by stripping out its own dopamine receptors. With the reduction of dopamine receptors, the person needs more and more of her favored substance to produce the euphoria it once offered her. The vanishing dopamine receptors also help explain the agony of withdrawal: Without that favored substance, a person is suddenly left with a brain whose capacity to experience reward is well below its natural levels. It is an open question whether every brain returns to its original settings once off the drug. Nearly three years after getting the prescription, in 2008, I found myself sobbing in a psychiatrist’s office in New Haven, where I was finishing graduate school, explaining to him that my life was no longer my own. I had long been telling myself that by taking Adderall, I was exerting total control over my fallible self, but in truth, it was the opposite: The Adderall made my life unpredictable, blowing black storm systems over my horizon with no warning at all. Still, I couldn’t give it up. The psychiatrist was a kind Serbian man with an unflappable expression. He observed my distress calmly and prescribed Wellbutrin, an antidepressant with a slightly speedy quality that could cushion the blow of withdrawal and make it less painful to get off the Adderall. His theory was sound. But soon enough, I was simply taking both medications. Through my Adderall years, I lived a paradox, believing that the drug was indispensable to my very survival while also knowing that it was nothing short of toxic, poisonous to art, love and life. By 2009, I had a contract to write a book about psychoanalysis and neuroscience shortly after, I took a day job as a reporter for a news website. What was required of me there was the constant filing of short, catchy pieces: to be quick and glib and move on to the next one. It was the kind of rhythm perfect for an   like me  —   and the kind of writing at odds with the effort to think slowly and carefully, at book length. The goal of slow and careful thinking came to feel more and more anachronistic with each passing week. It didn’t escape me that just as Adderall was surging onto the market in the 1990s, so, too, was the internet, that the two have ascended within American life in perfect  . Occasionally, I would try to get off the drug. Each attempt began the same way. Step 1: the rounding up of all the pills in my possession, including those secret stashes hidden away in drawers and closets. Debating for hours whether to keep just one, “for emergencies. ” Then the leap of faith and the flushing of the pills down the toilet. Step 2: a day or two of feeling all right, as if I could manage this after all. Step 3: a bleak slab of time when the effort needed to get through even the simple tasks of a single day felt stupendous, where the future stretched out before me like a grim series of obligations I was far too tired to carry out. All work on my book would stop. Panic would set in. Then, suddenly, an internal Adderall voice would take over, and I would jump up from my desk and scurry out to refill my prescription  —   almost always a simple thing to achieve  —   or borrow pills from a friend, if need be. And the cycle would begin again. Those moments were all shrouded in secrecy and shame. Very few people in my life knew the extent to which the drug had come to define me. Over the years, I’ve been told by various experts on the subject that it should not have been so hard to get off Adderall. The drug is supposed to be relatively quick and painless to relinquish. I’ve often wondered whether my inability to give it up was my deepest failing. I’ve found some comfort in seeing my own experience mirrored back to me in the dozens and dozens of disembodied voices on the internet, filling the message boards of the websites devoted to giving up this drug. One post, in particular, has stayed with me, a mother writing on QuittingAdderall. com: I started taking Adderall in OCT 2010. And my story isn’t much different than most. . .. The honeymoon period, then all downhill. I feel like I cannot remember who I was, or how it felt, to go one minute of the day not on Adderall. I look back at pictures of myself from before this began and I wonder how I was ever “happy” without it because now I am a nervous wreck if I even come close to not having my pills for the day. There have been nights I have cried laying my daughter down to sleep because I was so ashamed that the time she spent with her mommy that day wasn’t real.  “Nobody starts off by saying, I’m going to go develop a drug problem,” said Jeanette Friedman, a social worker with a specialty in addiction, when I met her in August at her Upper East Side office. “No one means to get addicted. But there’s such a casual use of something like Adderall nowadays  —   because it’s seen as benign, or a help to becoming more productive. And in our culture, to be productive is kind of everything. There’s a tremendous pressure not just to do well but to excel. ” When she is face to face with an addicted patient, Friedman explains, what is at stake is that patient’s very ability “to become a full person without the shadow of always needing something. ” Adderall complicates the usual dynamic of drug addiction by being squarely associated with productivity, achievement and success. “It’s very hard to think about going off it, because you don’t know if you’re going to be able to produce,” she says. “Plenty of people have gone off of it and have been able to tell the story, that yes, they definitely can produce. But the fear of not being able to is what keeps people still using. ” I remember that fear, in school and, later, at work, and it’s palpable in those   pleas: The way I feel now is way worse than my A. D. D. ever was before I went on this stuff. I no longer feel, at this present time, able to get a Ph. D. I don’t feel able to do coursework, I don’t feel interested and passionate about the things I loved. I need to know from you, dear readers, that this will be temporary. Harris Stratyner, a psychologist and addiction specialist at the Caron Treatment Center in Manhattan, told me that each year he’s in practice, he sees more people desperate to get off Adderall. Stratyner estimates that he has treated more than 50 patients trying to stop using the drug currently, they range in age from 24 to 40. His Adderall patients are overwhelmingly creative people who wanted to work in the arts  —   yet, he says, many have chosen other paths, safer paths, resigning themselves before they’ve even really tried to achieve what they hoped for. “They often give in to practicality,” he says. “Then they feel they missed out. And when they take Adderall, it makes them feel good, so they don’t focus on the fact that they feel like they sold out. ” Many people are using Adderall to mask a sense of disappointment in themselves, Stratyner says, because it narrows their focus down to simply getting through each day, instead of the larger context of what they’re trying to build with their lives. “It becomes extremely psychologically and physiologically addictive,” he says. “It’s really a tough drug to get off of. ” The side effects of Adderall withdrawal that his patients report include nausea, chills, diarrhea, body aches and pains, even seizures. Occasionally, it is necessary for him to hospitalize his patients as they come down off Adderall. In the end, I did not get off Adderall alone. I had a brilliant psychiatrist. I believe she saved my life. On the wall of her office, she had a single image: a framed print of an Henri Matisse painting. Through our time together, Matisse came to stand for the creative process. You start one place, go through hell and wind up somewhere else, somewhere that surprises you. Adderall, we both agreed, was a perversion of that journey. Gradually, her words entered my inner dialogue and sustained me. I was 30 by the time I got off Adderall for good. This statement horrifies me even now, more than three years later, recognizing the amount of precious time I gave away to that drug. During the first weeks of finally giving up Adderall, the fatigue was as real as it had been before, the effort required to run even a tiny errand momentous, the gym unthinkable. The cravings were a force of their own: If someone so much as said “Adderall” in my presence, I would instantly begin to scheme about how to get just one more pill. Or maybe two. I was anxious, terrified I had done something irreversible to my brain, terrified that I was going to discover that I couldn’t write at all without my special pills. I didn’t yet know that it would only be in the   years to follow that my book would finally come together. Even in those first faltering weeks, there were consolations. Simple pleasures were available to me again. I laughed more in conversation with my friends, and I noticed that they did, too. I had spent years of my life in a state of false intensity, always wondering if I should be somewhere else, working harder, achieving more. In the deep lethargy of withdrawal, I could shed that chemical urgency that kept me at a subtle distance from everyone around me  —   and from myself. On one of those earliest days of being off the drug, I was moving slowly, more than a little daunted, trying to walk the few miles to an appointment I had in Midtown Manhattan. It was a glorious summer evening, the sun just going down. As I approached Bryant Park, I heard live music and wandered in to see. A rock band was performing onstage. I hovered at the back of the crowd. The singer, muscular and bearded, gripped the microphone in front of him with two hands, pouring his heart into every word that left his mouth. His voice soared into that summer night. Suddenly, tears were streaming down my face. I was embarrassed, but I couldn’t stop. It was as if I hadn’t heard music in years.",0

LONDON City came to a standstill this morning as 40,000 insect rights activists came out in protest against ITV’s popular reality television game show I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, over the mass slaughter of critters. 
Complaints poured in to the ITV studios following last night’s trial, which saw callous contestants stomp and crush hundreds of insects live on air following a trial, which saw hundreds of thousands of organisms being forced into a box with four celebrities. 
“The cruel bastards just got up after their trial and squashed everything in their path,” insect rights activist Dona Smith told WWN, “These vile people have no regard for life and tonight they’re actually going to eat insects alive. They obviously get off on murdering innocent insects. This show should be banned from the air – it’s disgusting”. 
London police were later called to disperse today’s protesters as things got heated when one of the producers of the show tried to enter the ITV building in London situated in the south of the city. 
“Tempers flared and several insect activists attacked and injured some three policemen, before overturning a car and burning it out,” confirmed one officer. 
ITV confirmed that 2,345 cockroaches were killed in Australia during last night’s episode, along with 456 mealworms and 17 spiders. One rat was also treated for shock and is said to be in a stable condition today at a local vet’s surgery. 
Insect rights groups have vowed to keep protesting the show’s ongoing cruelty, and a million strong march is being organised for next week in central London.",1
20385,20385,Uber Defies California Regulators With Self-Driving Car Service - The New York Times,Mike Isaac,"For seven years, Uber’s stance on complying with regulations has been consistent: Ask forgiveness, not permission. On Friday, the   company stuck to that position. It said it had no intention of ending a new test of its   vehicles in San Francisco, even though California regulators had said the service was illegal because Uber had not obtained the necessary permits. Uber said its   cars were still on the road and picking up passengers. The dispute is rooted in Uber’s refusal to seek a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which would allow it to test autonomous vehicles under certain conditions. Companies like Google, Tesla Motors and   have all gotten such permits. Uber officials contend that under the letter of California law, the company does not need a permit because the motor vehicles department defines autonomous vehicles as those that drive “without the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person. ” Uber said its modified,   Volvo XC90s require human oversight, and therefore do not fit California’s definition of an autonomous vehicle. “This rule just doesn’t apply to us,” Anthony Levandowski, vice president of Uber’s advanced technologies group, said in a conference call with reporters. “You don’t need to wear a belt and suspenders and whatever else if you’re wearing a dress. ” The motor vehicles department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But in a letter to Uber on Friday, lawyers in the California attorney general’s office reiterated the state’s position that the company pull the   off the road until it got the permits or face unspecified consequences. The episode serves the latest volley in Uber’s war with local and state regulators  —   not only in the United States, but in many of the more than 70 countries in which the company operates. Uber has previously grappled with the authorities in California over safety concerns. And Otto, the   trucking   founded by Mr. Levandowski and acquired by Uber in August, has flouted state laws in Nevada in the past. Uber argues the way its technology is used differs little from the way Tesla Motors, the electric carmaker founded by Elon Musk, uses its technology. Tesla offers a   system called Autopilot, which gives drivers the ability to “match speed to traffic conditions, keep within a lane, automatically change lanes without requiring driver input,” according to the company’s website. As of Dec. 8, Tesla held a permit in California for   testing. Uber said that permit did not apply to the wider commercial use of   cars bought by consumers, and that the motor vehicle department’s   process should be consistent across the types of vehicles on the road. “It’s an important issue of principle about when companies can operate   cars on the roads and the uneven application of statewide rules across very similar types of technology,” Mr. Levandowski said. A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment.",0

20387,20387,"NATO, US, And UK Assemble Largest Troop Buildup On Russian Border Since Cold War",Activist Post,"By John Vibes 
In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war. 
NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters , thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. 
It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russia’s border. 
On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia’s borders as part of a huge military deployment. 
A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia’s borders since the Cold War. 
In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time. 
The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a “deterrent” to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. 
“This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday — ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. 
Just imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to ‘prevent conflict.’ 
The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. 
The United States’ envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute, told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO’s deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the one that is many miles from home on the border of someone else’s lands. 
“This deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia’s) security posture,” Lute said. 
If anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government. 
These military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which Western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds. 
Until now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous Cold War, and the same type of situation is developing today.

20388,20388,Soldier Headed Home from Deployment Says United Airlines Charged Him $200 for ’Overweight’ Military Bag,Katherine Rodriguez,"A National Guard soldier headed home from a deployment to Afghanistan says he was charged a hefty fee to check his military bag. [First Lieutenant John Rader said United Airlines made him pay $200 to check a   bag on his flight to Austin, Texas, from El Paso, the final leg of his trip home from his deployment to Afghanistan, because it was overweight, Fox News reported.  “I was told point blank that I’d have to pay $200 for the overage or find another bag to siphon stuff off with,” Rader told FOX 7. “Well, I didn’t have another bag so I was caught in a bind. ” Some of the things in his bag included Kevlar vests, two helmets, and boots. Rader said he was initially required to serve a   deployment, but he volunteered to extend his deployment to 21 months. United says   military can check up to five bags as long as they are each 70 pounds or less, according to the airline’s website. Delta has a similar policy, while American and Southwest allow   military to check their bags for free provided that they are 100 pounds or less. Rader said he tried to work it out with the ticket agent so he would not have to pay the fee but was told his bag was too heavy for the military benefit. “There was no empathy to the situation. I’m not looking for sympathy, but some form of empathy in the situation. There was none of that. It was just cold. I had to either pay or leave the bag,” Rader said. He added that another soldier on his flight also had to pay a fee. United Airlines released a statement apologizing for the incident: “We are disappointed anytime a customer has an experience that doesn’t meet their expectations, and our customer care team is reaching out to this customer to issue a refund for his oversized bag as a gesture of goodwill. ”",0
20389,20389,A Tradition of Forgetting Indian Rights,Consortiumnews.com,"A Tradition of Forgetting Indian Rights November 22, 2016 
Ironically, as Americans commemorate how Native Americans helped save the Pilgrims in 1621, Indian-rights activists are under attack today in defense of land that a 1868 treaty guaranteed as theirs, observes Nat Parry. 
By Nat Parry @natparry 
Making official a quintessential American tradition dating back to the 1621 feast between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag tribe, President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 declared the last Thursday of November to be the national day of Thanksgiving – a vain attempt to unite the North and South at the height of the Civil War. 
Five years later, continuing a closely paralleled American tradition, the U.S. government signed the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, which established the Great Sioux Reservation west of the Missouri River and promised no more white settlement in a huge, 18-million acre swath of land. 
Over the next two decades, as Civil War Reconstruction was completed and a nationwide Thanksgiving date was finally agreed upon by Northern and Southern states, the U.S. continuously reneged on the Fort Laramie Treaty, eventually breaking the Great Sioux Reservation up into five smaller reservations: Cheyenne River Reservation, Lower Brule Indian Reservation, Rosebud Indian Reservation, Pine Ridge Reservation, and Standing Rock Reservation. 
More than a century later, in 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the government had illegally taken this land, and awarded $120.5 million to the Sioux Nation, based on the market value of the land in 1877, plus interest. For nearly four decades, however, the Lakota Sioux have refused to accept payment and instead continued to demand that the United States return the territory. 
Today, the Sioux people are continuing to take a stand on these principles – the flashpoint now being the Dakota Access Pipeline, which, upon its completion is expected to transport some 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across several states. Sioux tribe members and their allies have protested this pipeline for months, raising concerns about the threat it poses to their water supply, the effects that the fracked oil will have on the climate, and the process by which the project was approved, saying that it failed to take into account Native rights. 
“We live with so many broken promises, there’s no reason for it,” said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. “We understand what lands we own, and what lands were illegally taken from us.” 
The government, of course, is responding the way it always has to Native American resistance – through brute force. Over the past few months, police and private security forces have viciously suppressed the water protectors, siccing dogs on them and arresting them for “trespassing.” The repression, which a group of United Nations experts called “excessive” and “increasingly militarized,” culminated Sunday night in some of worst violence against Native people seen since the 1973 siege of nearby Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. 
Police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper spray and water at hundreds of protesters in the subfreezing North Dakota weather late Sunday night and early Monday morning, following an attempt by protesters to remove burned vehicles blocking Backwater Bridge in order to enable emergency vehicles and local traffic to move freely. 
The police assault led to several reported cases of life-threatening hypothermia. “It is below freezing right now and the Morton County Sheriff’s Department is using a water cannon on our people – that is an excessive and potentially deadly use of force,” said activist Dallas Goldtooth. 
Every aspect of this appears to violate the letter and spirit of the 1868 Laramie Treaty, in which the federal government not only promised to respect Sioux land rights, but also to come to the aid of Native people if they are wronged by outside forces. 
“If bad men among the whites, or among other people subject to the authority of the United States, shall commit any wrong upon the person or property of the Indians, the United States will … proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States, and also re-imburse the injured person for the loss sustained,” the treaty reads . 
At this time of Thanksgiving, it would only be appropriate for President Barack Obama to insist that the “bad men” who are committing wrongs “upon the person or property of the Indians” stand down immediately, as well as to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and reimburse the Sioux for losses already sustained. 
Then, perhaps, the shameful tradition of breaking treaties while giving thanks might itself be broken, and Americans might be able to enjoy their turkey dinners and family reunions without a cloud of hypocrisy hanging over their heads.",1

20391,20391,"If You Dress Like An Attention Whore At Work, Expect To Be Treated Like One",David G. Brown,"A favorite trope of feminists and women claiming workplace discrimination is that female staff are the victims of “sexism” due to judgments about their appearance. But how many times have we all seen girls working in our building or out on their lunch breaks in attire more befitting of a Tinder date, raunchy nightclub, strip joint, or even the gym? Meanwhile, men must keep their fashion within a very narrow range of acceptability, otherwise they risk failing to get that fancy new job or could lose their current one.
Furthermore, guys learn to deal with the fact that the world does judge you based on your appearance. Many women have zero idea about this concept, only accepting the judgments they agree with or those ones that further their interests and career. For those opinions they don’t like, they can always conveniently claim the person giving them is sexist or misogynist, or, just as amorphously, “objectifying” a woman. This is classic attention-seeking.
Attention-whore Jayde Phoenix.
The epitome of this growing female narcissism is a British woman by the name of Jayde Phoenix . Touting herself as a “IT security expert” (despite her academic and job credentials being a fraction of what it means to be highly qualified or plain non-existent), she suggested a “guess the number of USBs in a jar” competition to promote her company. With her breasts nearly spilling out of a see-through top, she looked at the camera with a lustful gaze, what many on the Roosh V Forum would call “a thousand cock stare.” Her clothes (and demeanor) better suited a street hooker than a “professional.”
As we should have expected in our troubled times, the many critics of Phoenix’s contrived appearance were labeled as “sexists,” “bullies,” and “misogynists.” She herself tried to excoriate her detractors, emphasizing how “good” she was at her job and the professional standards she supposedly meets every day. But there are a few questions both the original photo exercise and her subsequent justifications failed to answer, namely:
If she’s so good at her job, why did she need to use a see-through bra in the picture? Why doesn’t she wear a top size that comfortably contains her breasts, rather than flaunting them? Why is she and not someone else in the photo? Though the attention-seeking of Jayde and her employer first flared up several months ago, the dilemma of girls like her is an ongoing one.
Try getting employed in an office as a man with this sort of attire Baggy pants with your underwear showing 
The male office worker could be wearing black pants and not jeans, like in the photo, and sporting a typical business shirt. That doesn’t matter. No white collar company worth a dime is going to hire a man whose boxers or briefs are showing down to his ass. Compare this to the parade of female office workers who go beyond showing their arms and the hint of a bra strap to exhibiting half the surface area of their breasts. In addition, if you haven’t already noticed, the very short crop top is now a staple garment within American office (un)culture. It is not unusual to see a large part of a woman’s bare stomach and back, including over-the-top tattoos.
Hawaiian shirts and board shorts 
Some workplaces, most notably those trying to appear “hip,” have drastically relaxed the need for business attire. But these employers are definitely in the minority. A man with a penchant for Hawaiian shirts, board shirts or other beach clothing will find his career options drastically limited. As they should be! The way in which you relate to your friends or fellow tourists on a holiday is almost always far different from how you should deal with clients, investors, stakeholders and the like in your profession. Men save their best (or worst) Hawaiian shirt for office charity fundraising days, company summer parties and related functions, not an average day.
Leather, lycra or ridiculously tight clothing in general 
Inasmuch as tight clothing on men doesn’t tickle your or my fancy, it’s how ironic how an obese woman can wear garments twice or thrice as close-fitting in the workplace than a fit male. And, male office workers of the world, don’t even consider wearing leather pants during your next boardroom presentation. The occasional gay man or metrosexual might escape sanction for some outlandish or garish outfit, but most industries, if they value their reputation with clients, will prohibit you from donning clothing that looks like it came from the wardrobe of Lance Armstrong or someone from Queer Eye for the Straight Guy .
Excuses for female attention-seeking are out of control It seems that “Lady” Victoria Hervey and Jayde Phoenix read the same book.
There is little doubt that Jayde Phoenix’s employer expected a backlash against her. In this sense, it was a very good marketing and advertising ploy (for those prospective clients who do not care about actual professionalism, of which there are many). As for Phoenix and other women like her, this situation is win-win. At the very least, she and those of her ilk can continue their day-to-day objectification of themselves, generating desperately craved male attention in particular. Even for girls who do not receive the public’s spotlight, any roadblock or mishap in their career can later be blamed on “misogyny” after judgments about their appearance.
At best, as happened in Phoenix’s situation, she gets nation-wide and even global coverage. For narcissistic girls who take zero responsibility for how others may negatively perceive them, this is the coup of a lifetime. Yet as they age (and Jayde Phoenix looks far older than her early 20s), expect their antics to become more straw-clutching. And while these girls engage in sexual self-advancement and wage war over imaginary discriminations, the vast majority of male employees have no scapegoat they can use to rationalize their failures and virtually no means of combating institutionalized prejudice against their so-called “privilege.”

NIGEL Farage will be Donald Trump’s high powered ‘go-between’ whenever the new president wants to eat some pizza. 
An excited Farage was summoned to New York by Trump yesterday to be appointed as one of the billionaire’s eight ‘fast food ambassadors’. 
Farage said: “It will be my job to sit down with the nearest Domino’s and talk through Donald’s approach and his priorities. They need to understand that he wants to a deal about pizza, but it has to be the right deal. 
“His claim that anchovies were only fit for Mexican rapists was campaign trail rhetoric. 
“He wants to work with anchovies, he wants to work with thinly sliced ham and he wants to work with black olives. 
“Well, maybe not black olives. Do olives come in beige? And if not, why not?”

20393,20393,Американо-корейские отношения и новый президент США | Новое восточное обозрение,nan,"Регион: Восточная Азия Наблюдая реакцию корейской общественности на победу в президентских выборах Трампа, можно отметить «великую печаль» — политические круги Южной Кореи скорее болели за Клинтон, вспоминая желание Трампа как минимум повысить плату за содержание американского контингента в РК. Сегодня в состав этой группировки входят 28,5 тыс. военнослужащих, истребители F-16, ЗРК Patriot и другие виды наступательных и оборонительных вооружений. На их замену южнокорейскими потребуются примерно 16,3 млрд долларов, и на фоне экономического кризиса и политических проблем Сеулу будет непросто раскошелиться на такую сумму. Конечно, как только результаты выборов в США стали известны, Пак Кын Хе поздравила Трампа с избранием, указав, что американский народ выразил доверие его лидерским качествам и огромному успешному опыту в различных сферах. Глава РК также подчеркнула, что Сеул будет продолжать тесное сотрудничество с Вашингтоном в целях стабильности и процветания во всем мире. В тот же день 9 ноября администрация президента РК провела экстренное заседание Совета национальной безопасности. Там Пак Кын Хе дала указание подготовить экстренные меры реагирования в сфере экономики и безопасности в новой обстановке. 10 ноября заседание по оценке итогов президентских выборов в США провело министерство обороны РК. По его итогам военные подтвердили позицию о продолжении сотрудничества с американской стороной по вопросам ротационного размещения стратегических сил США в РК, мобильной системы ПРO THAAD и передачи Сеулу оперативного контроля над своими войсками в военное время. Кроме того, принято решение о создании рабочей группы по сотрудничеству с США в оборонной политике, направленной на сохранение крепкого союза РК и США. Первый итог работы этой группы – сделанный 14 ноября доклад о том, что новое правительство США может потребовать увеличения расходов южнокорейской стороны на содержание американского военного контингента, а также наращивания возможностей собственной армии. Прежняя политика Барака Обамы будет изменена на более активное санкционное давление, допускающее, однако, диалог. В этом контексте американской стороне надо объяснить, какие меры принимает РК для обеспечения комфортного пребывания контингента США, и указать, что вооружённые силы США вносят вклад в мир и стабильность в регионе. Ведь расходы РК на содержание американского контингента по доле к ВВП выше, чем в Японии и Германии. Отмечается и вероятность полного пересмотра условий свободной торговли. Вице-премьер по вопросам экономики Ю Иль Хо заявил, что победа Дональда Трампа на выборах может дать южнокорейской экономике новые возможности. Поскольку южнокорейские компании могут принять участие в развитии инфраструктуры и производственной отрасли США. Таким образом, правительство РК приступило к подготовке к работе с новым американским правительством, проводя тщательный мониторинг экономической программы Трампа. Комментируя действия власти, СМИ РК пишут, что оценить направления политики Дональда Трампа в отношении Севера трудно. Он то называл Ким Чен Ына «маньяком», то не исключал возможности диалога с Пхеньяном, говоря о решении ядерной проблемы Севера через давление на Китай. Что же до потенциально острых моментов в отношениях РК и США, требующих пересмотра, то это не только доля РК в расходах на содержание американского военного контингента. В настоящий момент южнокорейская сторона покрывает половину, но Трамп выражал мнение о том, что РК должна взять на себя 100% расходов, а деньги, которые США тратят на безопасность союзников, должны быть направлены на собственные нужды. Более того, им озвучивалась позиция о возможности ядерного вооружения РК и Японии, и хотя радикал-консерваторы РК уже открыто обсуждают такой вариант, официальный Сеул против, полагая, что это только ухудшит региональную стабильность. Кроме того, Дональд Трамп считает условия соглашения о свободной торговле между РК и США неравноправными и лишающими американцев рабочих мест. Он говорил о необходимости пересмотра соответствующих договорённостей. Всё это не могло не вызвать обеспокоенности традиционных союзников США. Не обходится и без опасений по поводу отсутствия прямых каналов связи с командой Дональда Трампа. Надеясь на успех Клинтон, южнокорейские политики не занимались налаживанием мостов с альтернативным кандидатом и необходимость в предварительной подготовке к сотрудничеству с новым правительством США чувствуется как никогда. Однако признаков резкого изменения политики пока нет. 9 ноября 2016 г. в ходе очередного брифинга представитель Белого дома Джошуа Эрнест указал, что, скорее всего, администрация Дональда Трампа будет придерживаться линии сохранения крепких отношений между Вашингтоном и Сеулом. Над укреплением отношений между США и РК работали и демократы, и республиканцы и, более того, определенные проблемы в отношениях двух стран (как это было, скажем, при Пак Чон Хи и Картере) чаще случались при демократах. На следующий день, в ходе состоявшегося 10 ноября телефонного разговора с президентом РК Пак Кын Хе Дональд Трамп подтвердил приверженность Вашингтона союзу с Сеулом и обеспечению безопасности РК. По данным МИД РК, в ходе десятиминутного разговора Дональд Трамп заявил, что Вашингтон без каких-либо колебаний будет продолжать сотрудничество с Сеулом в вопросе безопасности. Некоторые американские эксперты тоже полагают, что перемен не будет. Так, экс-председатель комитета по делам разведки Палаты представителей Конгресса США Питер Хукстра считает, что новое правительство во главе с Дональдом Трампом будет сохранять крепкие отношения с РК. Хукстра подчеркнул, что сегодня Сеул и Вашингтон поддерживают тесное сотрудничество в сферах экономики и безопасности, и в Южной Корее полагают, что это заявление направлено на сглаживание опасений. Конечно, пишут на международном радио РК, резкие заявления Трампа являются отражением его убеждений. Но, возможно, это связано лишь со стремлением заручиться поддержкой большего количества избирателей, и южнокорейские эксперты надеются, что жесткие высказывания Трампа не найдут продолжения в реальной политике нового правительства, которое будет придерживаться более сдержанной и разумной линии. Похоже думает и южнокорейская оппозиция. Лидер фракции оппозиционной Демократической партии Тобуро У Сан Хо заявил, что американские парламентарии не хотят изменений в отношениях РК и США, поэтому граждане РК могут особо не беспокоиться по поводу избрания президентом США Дональда Трампа, а председатель оппозиционной Народной партии Пак Чи Вон также указал на то, что Дональд Трамп будет вести политику с практической точки зрения и это может дать РК некоторые преимущества. Автор также склоняется к позиции, что радикального изменения в отношениях двух стран не произойдет и не раз высказывал эту точку зрения . Поэтому к данной теме мы вернемся только если возникнет серьезный повод для беспокойства.

20394,20394,Who Is Elena Ferrante? Supporters Say NOYB - The New York Times,Rachel Donadio and Jennifer Schuessler,"The readers of Elena Ferrante are devoted  —   and fiercely protective  —   of that anonymous Italian author. That much was clear from the swift and unforgiving backlash after an investigative journalist used financial documents to suggest in an article  published on Sunday that Anita Raja, an Italian translator, was behind Ms. Ferrante’s books. Many readers saw the story  —   which appeared simultaneously on the website of The New York Review of Books and in an Italian, a German and a French publication  —   not only as a violation of privacy but as an unprovoked aggression against an author known for female protagonists who use radical   to exert power over their lives and fates. In his article, Claudio Gatti, a reporter for Il Sole 24 Ore, an Italian financial daily, did not definitively name Ms. Raja as Ms. Ferrante, but he described financial records indicating that payments from Ms. Ferrante’s publishing house, Edizioni   to Ms. Raja, a consultant there, had risen dramatically since 2014, when Ms. Ferrante’s four Neapolitan novels became an international publishing phenomenon. His report drew broad condemnation in the literary world, with writers for The New Yorker, The New Republic, The Times Literary Supplement and elsewhere questioning whether an intriguing literary mystery needed to be resolved through tough investigative journalism techniques. “You do an investigation into property for tax evaders, not for those who want to preserve their anonymity,” the Italian novelist Erri De Luca wrote in an email. “It’s a serious violation of the right to privacy. I’m sorry for Anita Raja, who will now be forced into celebrity. ” Running through the conversation was the notion that Mr. Gatti’s exposé was a sexist violation  —   yet another example, critics said, at a moment of intense debate over gender inequality, of how successful women find themselves bullied and demeaned by men. “People really went there very quickly,” Elaine Showalter, a retired professor at Princeton University and the author of numerous works of feminist criticism, said of the charge of sexism against Mr. Gatti. “Here’s a woman who is not only extremely successful but explores women’s lives in a way that doesn’t depict men very favorably,” Ms. Showalter continued. People may be seeing Mr. Gatti’s unmasking of the author, she added, “as a kind of revenge. ” Mr. Gatti said in an interview that he did not understand the strong reactions. “I wasn’t going after a woman, I was going after a mystery,” he said. “I would like to ask the people who didn’t want to know, ‘Explain what work of art in the history of art has been ruined or damaged by knowing who the artist is?’ I can name many, many cases where the art is enhanced. ” Hugh Eakin, editor of The New York Review’s blog, which published the   version of Mr. Gatti’s report, said the occasion for the piece was the forthcoming   release of an expanded version of a book of Ms. Ferrante’s nonfiction writings, in which the author says she grew up in Naples as the daughter of a seamstress. “Now that an expanded version is about to be published in English, it seemed there was a legitimate occasion to inquire about the relation between the book and its author,” Mr. Eakin wrote. Ms. Raja was born in Naples, but grew up in Rome, the daughter of an Italian father and, as Mr. Gatti said in a deeply reported sidebar, a Polish Jewish mother who fled Nazi Germany for Italy. Ms. Raja’s husband, the novelist Domenico Starnone, has said in interviews that he grew up in Naples and that his mother was a seamstress. He has spent years saying that he is not Ms. Ferrante. Ms. Raja has also denied authorship of Ms. Ferrante’s books. Mr. Eakin added of Mr. Gatti’s reporting, “Though it amasses considerable evidence it’s also worth noting the article does not make a conclusive statement. ” (Mr. Gatti had approached The New York Times several weeks ago about possibly publishing his research, but the newspaper decided not to pursue the arrangement, which would have involved coordinating with multiple journalistic partners.) Over the years, there have been other attempts to unmask authors, such as Joe Klein, who wrote “Primary Colors,” a roman à clef about Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign, or Anne Desclos, who used a pseudonym when she wrote the 1954 erotic classic “The Story of O. ” But the effort to unveil Ms. Ferrante seemed to hit a deeper chord, perhaps because she has said in interviews that anonymity was crucial to her writing process. And it seemed to reveal a clash of sensibilities  —   between the journalistic and the literary, between those who believe anyone who publishes is fair game and those who believe some secrets should be kept. In short, a clash between the world of   reporting and the emotional truths of fiction. The publication in four languages simultaneously was “very aggressive  —   more appropriate to the capture of a criminal,” the novelist Alexander Chee wrote in an email. “She seems to have offended him by keeping herself private  —   it’s like the literary version of ‘How to Talk to a Woman Wearing Headphones,’” he added, referring to recent controversy over a blog post. Even some readers who admit they were curious to know say that they somehow didn’t want Ms. Ferrante’s identity to be made public. The editor of The Times Literary Supplement, Stig Abell, wrote a piece called “Why the TLS Would Not Have Named Elena Ferrante,” citing the author’s right to privacy. Salman Rushdie took to Facebook. “I am Elena Ferrante,” he wrote. “In the spirit of ‘I am Spartacus,’ in the wake of the New York Review of Books’ tawdry ‘exposé’ of her identity, every writer in the world should do this now. ” Not all writers shared that position. The critic Marco Roth said that Mr. Gatti’s reporting was valuable, even inevitable. “Conditions change for all writers once they’ve been published and it’s naïve to assume that Ferrante’s pseudonymity (had it been protected) would have allowed her to flower forever in the brilliant vein of ‘My Brilliant Friend,’” Mr. Roth wrote on Facebook, referring to the first of Ms. Ferrante’s Neapolitan novels. “Anita Raja will now have to work this new twist in her life into the next stage of her work, whatever that may be. No writer can control or really has the right to control the conditions of her reception,” Mr. Roth added. Some writers invoked the rhetoric of sexual assault in condemning Mr. Gatti’s approach. Alexandra Schwartz, on the website of The New Yorker, blasted Mr. Gatti’s justifications for his unmasking  —   that Ms. Ferrante is a public figure and the public who buys her books has a right to know. “Certainly Gatti does not explain why he feels so free to interpret Ferrante’s ‘no’ as his ‘yes,’” Ms. Schwartz wrote. Some critics speculated on why readers were so protective of Ms. Ferrante’s anonymity. “By protecting her privacy, she protected ours,” the critic Dayna Tortorici wrote in a post on N+1. “More than Ferrante herself, her readers have benefited from her choice. ” “We are as invested in her anonymity  —   and her autonomy  —   as she is,” she added. “It is a compact: she won’t tell us, we won’t ask, and she won’t change her mind and tell us anyway. In exchange, she’ll write books and we’ll read them. ” Ann Goldstein, who translated Ms. Ferrante’s novels into English, said in an interview that she hoped the latest revelations, however inconclusive, would not change how readers approached Ms. Ferrante’s books. “I think people will read them the same way they’ve always read them,” she said. “I don’t know how important the author is. I’d take her position the books are in the world. They are what they are. ”",0
20395,20395,Homeschoolers Revolt Against Republican School Choice Bill - Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,"Homeschooling families throughout the nation are voicing opposition to a   school choice bill that they say will ultimately result in regulation of homeschooling in the United States. [Many parents who homeschool their children, as well as their numerous local and national homeschooling organizations, are protesting the bill, introduced by Iowa Rep. Steve King (R) and calling upon the members of Congress who are its sponsors to “leave homeschooling families alone. ”  School vouchers created by H. R. 610, the Choices in Education Act of 2017, “would be a slippery slope toward more federal involvement and control in homeschooling,” asserts William Estrada, director of federal relations for the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA). King’s bill would first repeal the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. While many homeschoolers agree with the repeal of ESEA, the bill next would send all federal education funds to the states in the form of grants, which states would then distribute as vouchers to public, private, and homeschooled students. Estrada asserts the bill would essentially create a “federal right to homeschool. ” Section 104 of the bill states, “To be eligible to receive a grant  …    the State will  …    make it lawful for parents of an eligible child to elect  …    to enroll their child in any public or private elementary or secondary school in the State or to   their child. ” Estrada explains: While this sounds good, HSLDA has fought  —   successfully —  for decades to make sure that there is no “federal right to homeschool” because what could be created by a favorable Congress could be regulated by a future, hostile Congress. It is far better (and far more constitutionally sound) for education decisions —  and homeschool freedom —  to be protected at the state level. We ask our friends at the federal level to simply leave homeschooling families alone. Section 105 of the bill further states: The State shall distribute funds  …    based on the number of eligible children enrolled in the public schools operated by each local educational agency and the number of eligible children within each local educational agency’s geographical area whose parents elect to send their child to a private school or to   their child.   …     On an annual basis, on a date to be determined by the Secretary, each local education agency shall inform the State educational agency of  …    the number of eligible children within each local educational agency’s geographical area whose parents elect  …    to   their child. Estrada says the bill allows states to “track” homeschooling students. “There is only one way that states and school districts can do this: by requiring homeschooling families to register with them, and be tracked by the school district,” he asserts. “This will be especially problematic in states that do not require homeschooling families to file a notice of intent with the local school district. H. R. 610 will require homeschooling families in all 50 states to register with the local school district. This would be just the first cost of ‘free government money. ’” In a statement on his website about the bill, King says: In order to receive a grant or voucher under my legislation, the State must ensure that the funds be distributed appropriately on a per pupil basis. Additionally and most importantly, this bill makes it lawful for the parent to make the ultimate decision between public, private or   education for their children. However, Estrada asserts it is not the job of the federal government to grant parents the freedom to decide their children’s education. “The Constitution protects the right of parents to direct the education and upbringing of their children, as the U. S. Supreme Court has ruled in its seminal cases of Meyer, Pierce, and Yoder,” he says. “Federal legislation to ‘protect’ homeschooling is unnecessary. ” In an interview with Breitbart News, King says he “regrets” most of all that a    meeting has not taken place with homeschooling parents prior to the uproar over his bill. The Iowa congressman says that while his legislative director has been on the phone with homeschoolers opposed to his legislation, a meeting he had slated with them may have been canceled due to his schedule. He said he and his staff have asked homeschoolers to hold back on their open criticism of the bill until he could meet with them. “And now we’ve got a national thing going on here that didn’t need to happen,” King says. “I’ve been trying for the last several weeks to have a meeting with them, and I’ve said to my staff I want to look them in the eye and I want to talk this through reasonably. ” “I’ve tried to talk openly and do business and we haven’t been able to have that meeting, and I regret that,” King emphasizes, still adding that he is surprised “there’s a nationwide effort to oppose the broadest, most sweeping bill that supports parents being in charge of their children’s education that this Congress has ever seen. ” He explains his view of the legislation: The objective is this, that we’re watching as a nationwide curriculum is being established, and that nationwide curriculum, coupled with the money that goes to that, pushes all the public schools into that system, and eventually drags the parochial schools into that curriculum. I’m watching as our   values are being undermined, and I’m watching as western civilization is being deconstructed systemically throughout our public school system and especially in our universities  —   which we don’t touch with this, by the way. The object is to put parents back in control of their children’s education and curriculum and put it in a position where the public schools compete with the parochial schools. To have exempted homeschools from this, would have made the bill the target of homeschoolers, too. King thinks homeschoolers should participate in his bill for the sake of the new system  —   the intention of which, he says, is to save the culture of the country that is being destroyed by the public school monopoly. He continues: They’re missing the objective of this bill, which is to put the public schools in a position where they have to compete with the parochial schools and respect and honor the homeschools, and let the states regulate those things at that level, not the federal government. States that are unwilling to pass a voucher program have to give up their federal money. So isn’t that a much bigger goal for us  —   to put the public schools into competition with parochial schools than it is to preserve the status quo of homeschool? Homeschoolers, King argues, want “to be protected from ever being threatened by a state approving federal funds going through a voucher system that might tempt some of their people to accept some money that comes from the state and federal government. ” “To do that, they would not want to have parochial schools have an opportunity to compete with the public schools, which takes down our ability to allow masses of parents to decide curriculums, moral values, etc. ,” he continues. “Many parents can’t afford to send their children to a parochial school, nor can they actually homeschool their children. ” Wisconsin homeschooling parent Tina Hollenbeck, however, writes at her blog about the level of regulation King’s bill is inviting in for homeschoolers. The measure, she says, provides for states to be “mandated to send information about all children  —   yes, every child using any form of education  —   to the federal Secretary of Education in order to get the voucher money H. R. 610 claims the states are due. ” Hollenbeck continues: Of course, the states will want to report on all the children anyway  —   more children equals more money for state coffers even if some of us don’t take it  —   but even if a state wanted to behave ethically in order to protect the privacy of home educators who refuse voucher money, they are not allowed to do so under this bill. Thus, any state that currently requires any sort of notification from homeschoolers  —   information that previously remained at the local or state level  —   will now violate our privacy by giving information about us to the federal Secretary of Education  —   without regard to either the 4th or 10th Amendments to the Constitution. And we can expect swift ( ) action from states whose homeschool laws currently require no  . They will assert that they “must” know who the homeschooled children are according to H. R. 610  …     Karen Braun, a homeschooling parent from Michigan, also tells Breitbart News she is opposed to H. R. 610. “Reading the fine print, it is clear they will make sure that states distribute the funds in a manner so as to ‘ensure that such payments will be used for appropriate educational expenses,’” she explains. “And who gets to define ‘appropriate educational expense?’ They do. ” “This isn’t about giving homeschoolers help, or offering choices, but about giving the nanny state more control,” Braun concludes. The bill is   by Republican Reps. Andy Harris (MD) Trent Franks (AZ) and Pete Olson (TX). Estrada observes to members of HSLDA that Franks has clarified his position on the bill after speaking with homeschoolers: [W]e talked with Franks and his staff and they agree with our concerns about homeschooling families being included in H. R. 610. As a result, there is no need to contact his office, and we are deeply grateful to him for his commitment to protecting homeschool freedom from “help” by the federal government. Here is the statement Franks gave us: “I understand the concerns of the homeschool community. My support for the bill only extends to vouchers for public school and private school students. If this bill moves forward, I would request that any language that would impose vouchers upon homeschools is taken out. ” Breitbart News reached out to Franks’ office, and his staff confirmed his statement to Estrada. The bill is introduced just as Betsy DeVos takes her post as U. S. education secretary. DeVos  —   whose primary areas of interest have been school choice and school voucher programs  —   experienced unprecedented controversy during her confirmation process from both those on the left, who fear privatization of public schools, and those on the right who have warned against regulation of private and home schools through vouchers. The school voucher  —   as a transfer of taxpayer funds  —   is a finance mechanism to create school choice and one that is associated with the highest level of regulation for schools that agree to accept them. If parents use vouchers to send their children to a private school or to homeschool them, that school choice may have additional regulatory burdens placed upon it by the state in which it is located  —   in the name of “accountability. ” In a 2010 study at Cato Institute, Andrew Coulson studied the question of school vouchers and increased regulation of private schools. He concluded that “vouchers  …     impose a substantial and statistically significant additional regulatory burden on participating private schools. ” Voucher programs, Coulson concluded, are more likely to “suffocate the very markets to which they aim to expand access,” because state funds —  which invariably come with state regulation —  are directly transferred, in the form of vouchers, to parents to spend in an alternate education setting. Cindy Nicolai writes at the   Constitutional Home Educators Alliance that, for homeschoolers, government regulations are binding “strings. ” “  and   home education must avoid those strings in order to retain our independence, sovereignty, autonomy, and most importantly, our freedom,” she explains. “We recognize the value of that freedom and are willing to pay the cost to keep   home education unrestricted and free from government control. ” “Homeschools are not threatened under this bill,” King insists, but adds, “I’m still open to listen to viewpoints, but they also must listen to mine, and they have not done that. They should come and talk to me in a reasonable fashion instead of unleashing letters across the state and asking people to send tweets at me, send letters, and call my office. ”",0
20396,20396,Coal Miners Hope Trump’s Order Will Help. But Few Are Counting on It. - The New York Times,Campbell Robertson,"Eddie Mounts, the son and grandson of miners, describes the past few years in coal country as a time of economic plague. Businesses closed and people scattered, he said. They went to Tennessee, North Carolina, anywhere work could be found. If they had to learn a new trade, they did that, too. The source of the affliction, he insisted, could be traced to Washington, to the Obama administration and to regulations that Mr. Mounts, 54, said were intentionally designed to shut down the mines: “Shut them down and get them not working. ” So he was thrilled with the news on Tuesday that President Trump was signing an executive order aiming to roll back some of those regulations. “It may take a couple of years to catch fire again,” Mr. Mounts said. “But I think it will. ” It is hard to overstate the antipathy in coal country to the Obama administration’s regulatory approach, beyond even the rules that Mr. Trump has moved to undo. It included the Clean Power Plan, which would shutter older   power plants, and which the Trump administration is planning to rewrite, but also the assertiveness of federal health and safety regulation. Some saw these as mere attempts to bully the mines. It came as little surprise that Mr. Trump, who was flanked by coal miners as he signed the executive order in Washington, won Appalachia by huge margins in November. Hope that he can reverse the fortunes of coal country still runs high, as could be seen in the reactions of politicians like West Virginia’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, a Republican: This is a widespread sentiment  —   even if there is little solid evidence that Mr. Trump, or any president, can make all that much of a difference. “The market’s going to be what the market is, and that’s what’s going to set the demand,” said Robert Stinson, who operates a small coal mine in the city of War, in southern West Virginia, a few miles from the Virginia state line. Regulations certainly played a part in coal’s downturn, Mr. Stinson said. But only a part. Some of the fiercest coal country critics of the Obama administration have acknowledged as much. Robert E. Murray, an outspoken mining executive, recently suggested tempered expectations for a coal rebound. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, cautioned in November that the potential impact of a regulatory rollback would be “hard to tell. ” There are too many other, more decisive factors behind the decline in central Appalachian coal mining, said Sam Petsonk, a lawyer for Mountain State Justice, a legal aid organization in Charleston, W. Va. “The reserves just aren’t there anymore,” Mr. Petsonk said, explaining that West Virginia reached its coal production peak 20 years ago, and that some of the state’s power plants had even been importing coal from elsewhere. Still, expectations are not so tempered where the downturn is most keenly felt. “We just came into work one day and they said we got a meeting, and they told us,” recalled Mark Gray, 58, of the day he learned that the mine where he worked in Harlan County, Ky. was in trouble. “They said we can’t go on with these regulations, we can’t go on with the way the government’s doing. ” A week before Christmas 2013  —   five years into the Obama administration, but well before the Clean Power Plan was even announced  —   the mine shut down for good. Many miners scattered to Virginia or other parts of Kentucky, Mr. Gray said: “They just followed the jobs but the regulations followed them. ” Those left behind had little to turn to besides public assistance. Mr. Gray, who has black lung disease, never went back to mining. But he doubts he would have retired so soon if his mine had kept operating. He said Mr. Trump’s moves might help, at least to some degree. “It won’t ever be back the same,” Mr. Gray said. “But I hope some of the jobs come back and fix up little places like Harlan County. ” Gary Bentley, who spent a dozen years as a coal miner in eastern Kentucky, is less optimistic. Now working as a mechanic and writing about his years in the mines, he does not see a big turnaround coming. Blaming environment regulations is an old tradition, he said, one encouraged by the coal industry’s lobbyists. But it ignores too many hard facts, he said, like the increase in mechanization and the abundance of cheap natural gas. “It’s not going to make a comeback,” Mr. Bentley said of coal mining in central Appalachia. “But you get a certain amount of desperation, where you’re willing to believe stuff even though you know in your gut it’s not true. ” As much of coal country happily welcomed the news out of Washington, Mr. Bentley pointed to an announcement closer to home: This month the municipal utility of Owensboro, Ky. said its power plant, after 117 years, was going to phase out the burning of coal altogether.",0
20397,20397,Podesta Emails: Memo Reveals Clinton Campaign’s Plan To Coordinate With DNC,Kevin Gosztola,"Following the publication of emails from the Democratic National Committee by WikiLeaks, chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz was pushed to resign around the same time as the political party’s national convention. She privately attacked the Bernie Sanders campaign and was fiercely loyal to Hillary Clinton. However, a document recently published by WikiLeaks clearly indicates the Clinton campaign had little confidence in Wasserman Schultz’s leadership.
The document titled, “DNC Leadership,” is a memo attached to an email released as part of the “Podesta Emails.” It was circulated in December 2015, before the primary officially kicked off with the Iowa Caucuses, and it contains the campaign’s plan to appoint a chief of staff at the DNC, who could work with them during the primary instead of the DNC chairwoman.
“Though we have reached a working arrangement with them, our dealings with party leadership have been marked by challenges, often requiring multiple meetings and phone calls to resolve relatively simple matters,” the memo declares. “We are frequently caught in the middle of poor communication and a difficult relationship between the chairwoman and the executive director.”
“Moreover, leadership at the committee has been slow to respond to structural challenges within their own operation that could have real impact on our campaign, such as research.”
“Jen O’Malley Dillon has entered into a contract with the DNC as a consultant for the general election, which addresses some of these challenges and provides a connection for us within the party,” according to the memo. “However, this arrangement does not change the need for systemic shifts at the DNC leadership level—to ensure that we have strategic and operational partners within the committee that can help drive a program and deliver on our general election imperatives.”
The memo further reveals there were an array of “special projects” the campaign agreed to work on with the DNC before Clinton secured the nomination. They included “GOP opposition research, communications, and discrete data and analytics projects.” And from March through July, the campaign planned to bring on a chief of staff to “drive the day-to-day work” with the party until the convention.
NBC News reported in February that the campaign hired Dillon, a former Obama deputy campaign manager. The report suggested it was to “retool messaging and strategy,” and it was perceived as a response to Sanders’s big victory in New Hampshire. None of the reports mentioned Dillon’s role at the DNC or that hiring Dillon was planned back in December.
The memo shows the campaign favored keeping Amy Dacey on as CEO .
There were three plans of action for the DNC after the convention, none of which were executed because Wasserman Schultz resigned.
One of them involved neutering Wasserman Schultz so her role was “largely ceremonial.” She would help with fundraising and serve as a surrogate. They planned to tell her the campaign would rely on Dillon to run the DNC.
Another scenario involved replacing Wasserman Schultz with former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, an ardent supporter of Clinton.
Throughout the primary, Wasserman Schultz constantly insisted she was neutral in her role as DNC chair.
“If I wanted to favor a candidate, I would not be DNC chair and I would support that candidate,” Wasserman Schultz said back in January. “It’s a pretty convoluted way to help a candidate when I have to actually function neutrally as the DNC chair.”
However, Democratic Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii resigned from her post as vice-chair of the DNC to endorse Sanders partly because she witnessed corruption in the DNC. The party inappropriately limited the number of debates. Wasserman Schultz even disinvited her from a debate in Las Vegas.
Sanders repeatedly criticized Wasserman Schultz and the DNC. The campaign’s lawyer, Brad Deutsch, condemned a fundraising arrangement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC.
“The Hillary Victory Fund has reported receiving several individual contributions in amounts as high as $354,400 or more, which is over 130 times the $2,700 limit that applies for contributions to Secretary Clinton’s campaign,” Deutsch wrote in a letter to Wasserman Schultz. “Bernie 2016 is particularly concerned that these extremely large-dollar individual contributions have been used by the Hillary Victory Fund to pay for more than $7.8 million in direct mail efforts and over $8.6 million in online advertising, both of which appear to benefit only HFA by generating low-dollar contributions that flow only to HFA, rather than to the DNC or any of the participating state party committees.”
DNC emails published by WikiLeaks revealed the party committee sought to cover up the fact that states were only permitted to keep a small portion of the funds raised. This allowed the campaign to skirt campaign finance laws and essentially operate a money laundering scheme to keep her campaign coffers burgeoning as Sanders consistently raised more funds than her with small dollar donations.
As POLITICO reported, Marc Elias, an attorney who advises the DNC and the Clinton campaign, wrote in an email to DNC officials, “The DNC should push back DIRECTLY at Sanders and say that what he is saying is false and harmful to the Democratic party.”
Dacey responded “I do think there is too much of this narrative out there — I also worry since they are emailing to their list (which has overlap with ours!)”
At virtually no juncture did the Clinton campaign have to address their plans to coordinate with the DNC, which explicitly undermined the impartiality of the committee.
So long as the efforts to work with leadership of the DNC to defeat Sanders and the GOP nominee remained secret, it made no sense to say anything. It was much easier to let Wasserman Schultz field all the blowback from their unethical cooperation and replace her when she was no longer needed.

20398,20398,WikiLeaks: Confirms Hillary Sold Weapons To ISIS,Starkman,"Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is a controversial character. But there’s no denying the emails he has picked up from inside the Democrat Party are real, and he’s willing to expose Hillary Clinton. 
Via AlternativeNews 

Now, he’s announcing that Hillary Clinton and her State Department were actively arming Islamic jihadists, which includes the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria. Clinton has repeatedly denied these claims, including during multiple statements while under oath in front of the United States Senate.
WikiLeaks is about to prove Hillary Clinton deserves to be arrested : 
The Reagan administration officials hoped to secure the release of several U.S. hostages, and then take proceeds from the arms sales to Iran, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua. Sounds familiar?
Scroll Down For Video Below! In Obama’s second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria.
Clinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called “Friends of Syria” (aka Al Qaeda/ISIS) to back the CIA-led insurgency for regime change in Syria.
Under oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early 2013 after the Benghazi terrorist attack. In an interview with Democracy Now, Wikileaks’ Julian Assange is now stating that 1,700 emails contained in the Clinton cache directly connect Hillary to Libya to Syria, and directly to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over 30,000 emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she was secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents span the time from June 2010 to August 2014; 7,500 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and what’s the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base?
JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesn’t exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And it’s gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases; hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs; feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some case—or contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilizations can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilisation is. We can’t possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand.
So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that’s there in those emails. There’s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton’s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.
It appears that Hillary Clinton committed perjury, just like her husband was caught doing as President.

20399,20399,Furious parents slam ‘damaging’ BBC sex change show aimed at six-year-olds,wmw_admin,"By wmw_admin on October 31, 2016 Sanchez Manning — Daily Mail Oct 29, 2016 
The BBC has been accused of acting recklessly after targeting children as young as six with a programme about a schoolboy who takes sex-change drugs. 
Parents are angry that the show, available on the CBBC website, features a transgender storyline inappropriate for their children. 
And concerned campaigners said it could ‘sow the seeds of confusion’ in young minds. The programme, Just A Girl, depicts an 11-year-old’s struggle to get hormones that stunt puberty, making it easier to have sex-change surgery in the future. 
One mother, writing on the Mumsnet website, said her daughter had become worried after seeing the video. She said her girl, who likes wearing boys’ clothes and playing football, had ‘asked me, anxiously, if that means she was a boy’. 
Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘It beggars belief that the BBC is making this programme freely available to children as young as six. I entirely share the anger of parents who just want to let children be children. 
‘It is completely inappropriate for such material to be on the CBBC website and I shall be writing to BBC bosses to demand they take it down as soon as possible.’ 
Former Culture Secretary Maria Miller voiced her concerns over the BBC tackling the subject in ‘an age-appropriate way’, saying such issues should be raised ‘where children can have support from parents’. 
And Tory MP Julian Brazier said: ‘This programme is very disappointing and inappropriate. Children are very impressionable and this is going to confuse and worry them.’ 
Family campaigner Norman Wells said: ‘It is irresponsible of the BBC to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex.’ 
Just A Girl is the fictional video diary of a child who calls herself ‘Amy’ and dresses as a girl. It is hosted on the CBBC website, aimed at children aged between six and 12. 
In the half-hour programme, Amy – played by an actress – reveals she was born a boy called Ben but has already started using puberty-halting drugs. 
Such hypothalamic blockers provoked a furore two years ago when The Mail on Sunday revealed an NHS clinic was willing to give them to children as young as nine. 
Critics cited research claiming that most teenagers confused about their gender never go through with surgery, with many realising they are gay. The BBC row comes amid growing controversy over gender issues, fuelled by a number of high-profile cases. In one, a Christian couple were threatened with having their 14-year-old daughter taken away because they oppose her plans to become a boy. 
In another, a seven-year-old boy was ordered to be removed from his mother’s care as ‘she was raising him as female’, causing him ‘a great deal of emotional harm’. 
In Just A Girl, Amy says: ‘When I was born, Mum said Dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football. But Mum knew I was different. She realised early on that I was born in the wrong body.’ 
She adds: ‘My Mum supported me when I did a PowerPoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that I wasn’t going to come to school in boys’ clothes any more, but girls’ clothes. I wasn’t Ben, I was Amy.’ 
Later Amy is shown telling a friend, Josh – a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl – that she is on hormone blockers, saying it took ‘ages’ to get them after ‘loads of tests and talks at the clinic’. ‘Once they realised I was trans for real, [I] got them,’ she says. In another entry, Amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called Liam, but confides: ‘Liam thinks I’m just a girl, but I’m not. I’m trans. And what’s he going to say if he finds out? Stop being my friend? Why? I’m still me, aren’t I?’ 
Child psychotherapist Dr Dilys Daws said the programme could confuse children. She said that, while it was natural for youngsters to wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex, the BBC was irresponsible to feature the ‘extreme’ step of gender change for six-year-olds because they were too young to grapple with such issues. 
The programme generated hundreds of comments on Mumsnet. 
One mother, who said her seven-year-old had watched the show, asked: ‘Am I being unreasonable to think this is an inappropriate topic for a young age group?’ 
Another replied: ‘Don’t think this is remotely suitable for a seven-year-old. To start suggesting that children can be transgender when they’re far too young to actually have a gender is reckless and damaging. A small boy who is told that he can become a girl may take this as meaning that sex changes are possible, that sometime in the future he’ll wake up with a girl’s body.’ 
Another user added: ‘I don’t think hormone therapy should be normalised any more than 12-year-olds drinking or doing recreational drugs should be normalised.’ 
Other critics slammed the BBC. Mr Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said: ‘The more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girl’s body and a girl can be born into a boy’s body, and that drugs and surgery can put things right, the more children will become utterly confused. Respecting and preserving a child’s birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue.’ 
But some parents on Mumsnet were more positive. One wrote: ‘I don’t believe there is “too young” for stuff like this. The earlier you teach your children that everyone is different and that nobody is “normal” the better.’ 
Dr Polly Carmichael, a clinical psychologist specialising in transgender children, said: ‘Raising awareness of these issues is the best way to challenge stigma and discrimination associated with identity issues. Programmes like Just A Girl can contribute to a healthy and informed public discussion.’ 
The BBC said: ‘Just A Girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to make sense of the world, deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends, which are universal themes that many children relate to, and which has had a positive response from our audience. 
‘CBBC aims to reflect true life, providing content that mirrors the lives of as many UK children as possible.’",1
20400,20400,DONALD TRUMP CLOSES GAP WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN MICHIGAN,Iron Sheik,"Home › POLITICS | US NEWS › DONALD TRUMP CLOSES GAP WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN MICHIGAN DONALD TRUMP CLOSES GAP WITH HILLARY CLINTON IN MICHIGAN 0 SHARES 
[10/27/16] Republican nominee Donald Trump is now within striking distance of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in Michigan, a state that has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. 
In the latest Fox 2 Detroit/Mitchell Poll , Trump trails Clinton by just six points. In the four-way poll, Clinton received 48 percent, Trump received 42 percent, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received 4.5 percent, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 1 percent. Clinton led Trump 50 percent to 44 percent, in the head-to-head. 
Fifty-nine percent of polled voters said that jobs and the economy are the most important issues, while 29 percent said that national defense and terrorism were most important. 
A Detroit Free Press/WXYZ-TV poll places Clinton ahead of Trump by 7 points, which is still a significant narrowing compared to previous polls. 
Public backlash against trade deals like President Barack Obama’s Tran-Pacific Partnership – a deal that Clinton once called “the gold standard in trade agreements”– was so fierce that Clinton changed her tune during the Democratic primary where she was defeated by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
“Across Michigan, Republicans are coming home and taking a united stand against Hillary Clinton’s radical, open-borders agenda and plan to double-down on failed Obama policies, such as Obamacare. We are also seeing independents, Democrats and union workers saying no to Clinton’s special interest driven agenda, and yes to Mr. Trump’s plan to put America first,” Tim Lineberger, communications director for Trump’s Michigan campaign team told The Daily Caller News Foundation. 
“Hard working Americans will be voting for change in November because they feel like the system is rigged against them, and they know that Clinton and her cohorts are the ones rigging it,” Lineberger added. 
Clinton was previously caught on tape telling a group of foreign bankers that her dream was a “hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.” Trump is also hoping to capitalize on the government’s recent report, stating that the price of Obamacare premiums are expected to increase an average of 22 percent.

20403,20403,‘I’ve Become a Racist’: Migrant Wave Unleashes Danish Tensions Over Identity - The New York Times,David Zucchino,"TAARNBY, Denmark  —   Johnny Christensen, a stout and   retired bank employee, always thought of himself as sympathetic to people fleeing war and welcoming to immigrants. But after more than 36, 000 mostly Muslim asylum seekers poured into Denmark over the past two years, Mr. Christensen, 65, said, “I’ve become a racist. ” He believes these new migrants are draining Denmark’s cherished   system but failing to adapt to its customs. “Just kick them out,” he said, unleashing a mighty kick at an imaginary target on a suburban sidewalk. “These Muslims want to keep their own culture, but we have our own rules here and everyone must follow them. ” Denmark, a small and orderly nation with a progressive   is built on a social covenant: In return for some of the world’s highest wages and benefits, people are expected to work hard and pay into the system. Newcomers must quickly learn Danish  —   and adapt to norms like keeping tidy gardens and riding bicycles. The country had little experience with immigrants until 1967, when the first “guest workers” were invited from Turkey, Pakistan and what was then Yugoslavia. Its 5. 7 million people remain overwhelmingly native born, though the percentage has dropped to 88 today from 97 in 1980. Bo Lidegaard, a prominent historian, said many Danes feel strongly that “we are a multiethnic society today, and we have to realize it  —   but we are not and should never become a multicultural society. ” The recent influx pales next to the one million migrants absorbed into Germany or the 163, 000 into Sweden last year, but the pace shocked this stable, homogeneous country. The   government has backed harsh measures targeting migrants, hate speech has spiked, and the   Danish People’s Party is now the second largest in Parliament. Some of the same hostilities were reflected this weekend in Germany, where voters in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s home state embraced   candidates  —   an emphatic rejection of her refugee policy. There is new tension between Danes still opening their arms and a resurgent right wing that seeks to ban all Muslims and shut Denmark off from Europe. Mr. Christensen, the retired banker, supports emerging proposals for his country to follow Britain in exiting the European Union. There is tension, too, over whether the backlash is really about a strain on Denmark’s generous public benefits or a rising terrorist threat  —   or whether a longstanding but latent racial hostility is being unearthed. Analysts say that the public voiced little opposition after 5, 000 Poles and 3, 300 Americans, among other Westerners, emigrated to Denmark in 2014, but that there has been significant criticism of the nearly 16, 000 Syrian asylum seekers who arrived that year and the next. They and other migrants were not invited, and many ended up here by accident, intercepted on their route to Sweden. Critics complain that these newcomers have been slow to learn Danish  —   though the Immigration Ministry recently reported that 72 percent passed a required language exam. Some Danes bristle at what they see as ethnic enclaves: About 30 percent of new immigrants lived in the nation’s two largest cities, Aarhus and Copenhagen, where Muslim women in abayas and men in prayer caps stand out among the blond and   crowds on narrow streets. Perhaps the leading  —   and most substantive  —   concern is that the migrants are an economic drain. In 2014, 48 percent of immigrants from   countries ages 16 to 64 were employed, compared with 74 percent of native Danes. The Immigration Ministry has sought to avoid what it calls “parallel societies” of migrants living in “vicious circles of bad image, social problems and a high rate of unemployment. ” Tightened immigration requirements, the ministry said in its latest annual report, weed out those “who have weaker capabilities for being able to integrate into Danish society. ” Omar Mahmoud, 34, an Iraqi engineer who entered Denmark a year ago and lives in a refugee center in Randers, a city of 60, 000, is trying his best to fit in. He and his wife are taking Danish classes, and their three children are learning the language and making Danish friends in school. They are Muslim, but attend church to learn about Christianity, and he said he was not opposed to his son’s eating pork, a staple of the Danish diet, though it is forbidden in Islam. Mr. Mahmoud said his family had not encountered direct insults or threats, but was frightened by the   and   tenor in the public discourse. “It’s like foreigners are put in a special clan, separate from the Danish people,” he lamented. Still, Mr. Mahmoud said that “some of the Danish people are angels” and that he was relieved to be far from the violence of Iraq. “I’m in my heaven now. ” Anders   a   city councilman in Randers, said the influx had forced a more honest conversation about national identity. “Our problem in Denmark is that we’ve been too polite,” he said. “No one dared talk about” immigration, he added, “because they were afraid they’d be called racist. ” Denmark is just one of many European nations grappling with the wave of migrants amid a spate of terrorist attacks across the Continent by Islamic extremists: A recent Pew Research Center survey found that at least half the citizens in eight of 10 countries polled said incoming refugees increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks. The confluence of these and other factors has prompted a   of the postwar promise of a unified, borderless Europe. Macedonia, Hungary and Slovenia have all built border fences. Denmark imposed new identity controls on its border with Germany in January, and for the first time since 1958, Sweden requires entering Danes to show identity papers. Many analysts saw Britain’s surprise vote to leave the European Union as an angry expression of concern that British  —   or, especially, English  —   identity was being diluted by the nation’s growing diversity. Debate is raging anew over whether certain Islamic modes of dress  —     swimsuits, known as burkinis, in France and face veils in Germany  —   inherently contravene countries’ values. Similar themes are seen as underpinning a wave of new measures here in Denmark. The government has made its citizenship test more difficult and slashed by nearly half a package of integration benefits. A measure passed in January, though rarely enforced, empowers the authorities to confiscate valuables from new arrivals to offset the cost of settling them. Last year, Denmark placed ads in   newspapers stressing its tough new policies, essentially suggesting: Don’t come here. Muslims do not assimilate as easily as Europeans or some Asians, said Denmark’s culture minister, Bertel Haarder, partly because, as he put it, their patriarchal culture frowns on women working outside the home and often constrains freedom of speech. “It’s not racism to be aware of the difference  —   it’s stupid not to be aware,” Mr. Haarder said. “We do them a blessing by being very clear and outspoken as to what kind of country they have come to, what are our basic values. ” But much of the difference remains unspoken. This is a country where pedestrians wait for a green light to cross even when no cars are in sight, a contrast to the bustling streets of Middle Eastern capitals. Birgitte Romme Larsen, a Danish anthropologist who has studied refugees and asylum seekers in rural areas, mentioned an African refugee who did not realize that closing his curtains during the day was interpreted as being unduly secretive. Other newcomers were not aware that congregating and talking loudly at a grocery might offend Danish sensibilities. “These implicit expectations cannot be written into an integration folder” migrants receive, Ms. Larsen said. Sherif Sulaiman, an organic food scientist who moved to Denmark eight years ago from Egypt, said Muslims must not close themselves off in enclaves but open themselves up for interaction. He is the manager of an Islamic center that opened in 2014 and invites Danes in for meals and for an annual “harmony week. ” Mr. Sulaiman pushed to have the mosque complex use Scandinavian architectural style and furniture, and lends its conference room to a church for meetings. “We should be like this glass  —   transparent,” he said, pointing to a window. “As long as we follow the rules of the country, we are part of Danish society. ” But some   immigrants who have lived in Denmark for decades say assimilation seems an elusive and   target. Patricia Bandak and her brother Sylvester Bbaale came to Denmark from Uganda as babies in 1989. Like their native neighbors, they are polite and punctual and ride their bicycles everywhere. The siblings are not Muslim but said they frequently encountered racism: In school, they were called the N word, and told that they should stop eating Ugandan food like matoke, a starchy fruit. Mr. Bbaale, 27, who operates a food truck, said he was beaten on the street last year by three men who cursed at him and told him to go back to Africa. “For a lot of people, being Danish is in your blood, so I will never be Danish,” said Ms. Bandak, 28, who became a Danish citizen in 2010 and is studying documentary film. “I call myself a Dane of a different color. ” Then there is Ozlem Cekic, a   Muslim who served as a leftist member of Parliament from 2007 to 2015. Her three children were born in Denmark, she wrote a 2009 memoir in Danish, and, she said, “I even dream in Danish. ” Yet Mrs. Cekic, 40, said she often received death threats and heard shouts of “Go home!” on the street. Every time terrorists strike Europe, she is bombarded by hundreds of hate messages. Lately, people have inundated her with accusations that Muslims are milking the welfare system and plotting against Danes. While in Parliament, Mrs. Cekic held “dialogue coffees,” at which she would explain  —   in fluent Danish  —   why she is as Danish as anyone. “They meet me for coffee and suddenly they say their problem isn’t with me but with those other people,” she recalled. “I tell them, ‘I am the other. ’” Karin Andersen is one of thousands of Danes trying to help the immigrants settle through groups formed on Facebook called Venligboerne, or Kind Citizens. She spends several days each month with Housam Mohammed Shamden, 38, his wife and two daughters, who fled Syria in 2014 and now live in Randers, with small Danish flags taped to the front door of their apartment and tucked into flower vases. “Danes are so concerned about losing their culture,” said Ms. Andersen, 62, a retired teacher. “But how many help the ones who want to be part of it?” However many, they are often drowned out by reports of Muslims being spat at and showered with racist slurs. In May, two Danes ripped the head scarves off two girls. The month before, a national controversy erupted after a public swimming pool in Copenhagen created   lessons in response to Muslim requests. “Freedom of speech is now interpreted as freedom to say anything hateful,” said Julie Jeeg, a law student who volunteers with an antiracism group. “Denmark is closing in on itself. People are retreating inward. ” Witness the “meatball war. ” In January, after revelations that a Randers day care center had stopped serving pork meatballs since its Muslim students would not eat them, the Town Council narrowly passed a measure requiring that pork be served “on equal terms with other kinds of food. ” The councilman who pushed the measure, Frank Noergaard of the Danish People’s Party, said he was incensed that “pork could be abandoned in Denmark,” adding, “If you give in on pork, what’s next?”",0

Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his bewilderment at why European countries were taking in so many migrants given the increasing number of rapes sweeping the continent, asserting that a society which cannot protect its children “has no future”. Putin made reference to a story out of Austria where an Iraqi migrant was not punished for raping a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna after he claimed it was a “sexual emergency” and that he didn’t understand the boy didn’t want to be raped. “I can’t even explain the rationale – is it a sense of guilt before the illegal alien Muslim migrants? A society that cannot defend its children today has no tomorrow, it has no future,” warned Putin, adding that he would not look to Europe for advice on Russia’s immigration policy given the situation that is unfolding there.

20405,20405,The Playboy Mansion Has a Buyer: A Twinkie King - The New York Times,Jonah Engel Bromwich,"The Playboy Mansion, the quintessential party house that held a special place in the imagination of American men for decades, has found a buyer, a Playboy spokesman said on Tuesday. The spokesman, John Vlautin, said the Los Angeles mansion, home to Hugh Hefner, 90, the founder of Playboy Magazine, was under contract to be sold to Daren Metropoulos, 32, a principal at the private equity firm Metropoulos  Company and an owner of Hostess Brands, the maker of that indestructible,   snack cake, the Twinkie. Mr. Vlautin declined to comment on the financial details, citing confidentiality restrictions. The house, which is nearly 20, 000 square feet, according to its sales listing, was built in 1927 in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles and has 29 rooms, including 12 bedrooms. It has a wine cellar, a theater, a gym, tennis courts and a huge swimming pool, complete with a shadowy grotto. Its listing price: $200 million. The listing also said the mansion was “one of a select few private residences in L. A. with a zoo license. ” Mr. Metropoulos will not have to go far once the purchase is completed: He lives next door in a house he acquired in 2009. He would, however, have to be willing to live with a nonagenarian celebrity roommate if he wanted to move in right away. Mr. Vlautin said that, regardless of the sale, Mr. Hefner planned to stay in the house indefinitely. Playboy bought the house in 1971, and Mr. Hefner moved in (permanently) in 1975. A spokeswoman for Mr. Metropoulos’s company said in a statement that after Mr. Hefner’s tenancy ends, the buyer hoped to connect his current house with the Playboy Mansion, “ultimately returning the combined 7.  compound to the original vision executed by noted architect Arthur R. Kelly. ” The mansion is famous for the lavish parties hosted by Mr. Hefner and attended by the rich, the famous and the  . The house has been featured as the ideal party destination for men in movies like “Beverly Hills Cop II” and television shows like “Entourage” on HBO. Holly Madison, a former girlfriend and housemate of Mr. Hefner’s and one of the stars of the E! reality show “The Girls Next Door,” which frequently featured the mansion, offered a different perspective on the house in her 2015 memoir. She called the climate “toxic” and described a stifling atmosphere that caused her to develop a stutter and even to consider suicide. Mr. Metropoulos told The Wall Street Journal, which reported the deal, that he was more interested in the mansion’s historic architecture than its reputation as a party pad. “The heritage of this property transcends its celebrity, and to have the opportunity to serve as its steward would be a true privilege,” he said. The Playboy Mansion was listed for sale early this year, and potential buyers expressed interest in acquiring Playboy Enterprises in its entirety. The company has suffered since the advent of internet pornography, and in March, its magazine stopped featuring fully nude women.",0

Whatever he does, he must be back at the police station before sundown. “Every second now is important,” said Maher, a slight    with a full beard, large eyes obscured behind tinted yellow lenses and a gray woolen ski cap that covered his bald pate. “If I want to visit my mother in Maadi, I can spend three hours getting there and back. ” The clock is ticking. “If I delay for 15 minutes, the police have the right to send me back to prison,” he said. Maher and I were sitting in his small, dark apartment at 3 o’clock on a Sunday afternoon in February, waiting for his children to return from their first day back at school after a   vacation. A television played a soccer match in a corner, and a coffee table was strewn with textbooks from Maher’s studies at Cairo University, where he is pursuing a second degree, in political science, this one begun behind bars. It was just six years ago that Maher was celebrated around the world as a symbol of freedom and democracy. In January 2011, as the leader of a    network of young activists called the April 6 Youth Movement, Maher mobilized hundreds of thousands of Egyptians in demonstrations in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and across the country that took down President Hosni Mubarak. The movement was considered for a Nobel Peace Prize, and Maher traveled across Europe and the United States talking about the Arab Spring and Egypt’s future with the likes of Ban   and Lech Walesa. But the hopes that were raised by the revolution dissolved into sectarianism and chaos, and Maher’s aspirations were extinguished within two years. Abdel Fattah   the defense minister and commander in chief of the armed forces, seized power in July 2013 and outlawed protests. Five months later, a judge found Maher guilty of illegal demonstration, rioting and “thuggery” and sentenced him to three years in jail. Another judge added six months to Maher’s sentence for “verbally assaulting a public officer while on duty” after he demanded that the police remove his handcuffs while in court for a 2014 appeal. Maher spent almost all of that period sealed in a small cell in a   wing at Tora Prison, a notorious complex on the outskirts of Cairo, built during British rule, that houses about 2, 500 political prisoners and common criminals. Hidden behind    walls, the vast compound encompasses seven prison blocks, ranging from a   facility for policemen and judges convicted of taking bribes to the supermax “Scorpion Prison,” a labyrinth of cells largely reserved for Islamists and April 6 leaders. Today Maher is nominally a free man, but the restrictions on his movements are stifling. The regime is deeply concerned that he could revive the   network that brought his followers to the streets six years ago. As it was explained to Maher, “tweets can lead to demonstrations, and demonstrations can lead to revolution, and that will bring down the regime and create martyrs,” he said. “So if you are tweeting, you are like a terrorist. ” Every day for the next three years, Maher must spend 12 of every 24 hours at his local police station, a “surveillance period” intended to ensure that he refrains from   activity. Under Egyptian law, he told me,   felons “have the right to have their surveillance inside the home with a guard downstairs. But they are using this surveillance as punishment. It is a kind of control to keep me all the time under pressure. ” The front door opened, and Maher’s wife, Reham, their daughter, Meral, 9, and their son, Nidal, 5, spilled into the room. Nidal raced to the television, switched it from the soccer match to a cartoon and then snuggled up to his father. “I missed these moments,” Maher said. During his incarceration, his contact with the children was limited to short visits twice a month. The encounters left his kids perplexed and disturbed. “At first I lied when they would visit me,” Maher recalled. “My daughter asked, ‘Why you are not in our home?’ and I said, ‘This is my job.’ She said, ‘So why are you wearing blue? ’’u2009” Reham, who met Maher at Cairo University 16 years ago and married him in 2007, told me that after a year they decided to explain the situation to their daughter. “I tried to make her grasp the difference between being detained for political reasons and being a common criminal,” Reham said. “I explained what the revolution was and how people protested. And I told her that when the current regime took over, it didn’t allow people to express their opinions. Sisi knew what happened to Mubarak, so he didn’t want them to speak out again. ” In prison, Maher earned a reputation as a defiant figure, repeatedly sending antigovernment criticism and vivid descriptions of his ordeal to the Western and Egyptian news media. “When I heard the president talk about the rule of law and human rights in Egypt, I said, ‘What is this bullshit? ’’u2009” he told me. “That made me want to write about the reality. ” Denied pens and paper, he scribbled messages on tissues, using pens smuggled into his cell, and managed to smuggle the notes out. After they were published, guards would tear apart his cell, removing bricks from walls to search for hiding places. They confiscated his books, radio and clothes, leaving him with only his thin prison uniform. At one point, they covered the open exercise yard with a tarpaulin, blotting out the sunlight, suspecting that Maher might somehow be smuggling messages through the air. Still he continued devising acts of rebellion. A year into his confinement, Maher grew an extravagant handlebar mustache and a long beard and then braided it. “It bothered them  —   it seemed like I was making fun,” he said. “The prison officials complained to my father. They said, ‘Please tell him to shave. ’’u2009” After getting out of jail, Maher decided to keep wearing facial hair it helped disguise his identity. Maher’s face is widely recognized in Egypt, and other April 6 Youth Movement leaders have been physically attacked by regime loyalists who blame them for plunging the country into instability and violence. When his wife enrolled their children in private school after Maher was sentenced to prison, she told the administrators that their father was “out of the country on business. ” The school never connected their father’s name to the famous activist, and even now, Maher said, when he picks his children up from their school, the staff has no idea who he is. Maher had to be careful with what he told me the regime might send him back to prison if he criticized Sisi too harshly. “Even if it was something minor, they would jail him,” Reham said. “It would be a catastrophe for us. ” Yet Maher’s reluctance runs against all his instincts. Since his release, he has sensed a deepening anger toward the regime, and he believes that the political climate may be changing. “People tell me that they can see through the lies,” he said, “and that they are supporting us. ” Sisi’s crackdown on the opposition far exceeds the darkest period of repression during the Mubarak era. Human rights groups claim that as many as 60, 000 political prisoners now languish in Egypt’s jails. (At the end of Mubarak’s rule, the figure was between 5, 000 and 10, 000.) Egypt’s prisons are filled to triple their capacity, and the regime has built 16 more prisons to handle the overflow. Once described by Amnesty International as “Generation Protest,” the youths who took to the streets in Egypt to bring down a dictator in 2011 have acquired a grim new nickname: “Generation Jail. ” Many Egyptians have accepted Sisi’s argument that another prolonged round of protests could invite radical Islamists to capitalize on the chaos. “He’s positioned himself as the sole leader who makes decisions because he knows what’s best for the nation, and he’s saving us from the fate of Syria and Libya,” Khaled Dawoud, a prominent Egyptian journalist and the leader of a small opposition party, told me. Egyptians are proud that the first Arab leader to whom President Trump spoke after his electoral victory was Sisi, a sharp contrast to Barack Obama, who had suspended military aid to Egypt for two years after the police massacre of 1, 000 Muslim Brotherhood supporters in August 2013 at Rabaa, a Cairo encampment. Obama never invited the Egyptian president to the White House. “The thinking is, Egypt is returning to its rightful place as a player,” said a veteran political observer in Cairo, who like many officials I spoke to feared retribution for discussing even   elements of Sisi’s policies. Sisi’s crackdown has unfolded amid one of the most expansive overhauls of the legal system in Egyptian history. After declaring a state of emergency and disbanding Parliament in 2013, he issued a series of presidential decrees that granted him unprecedented power to silence his critics. A protest law enacted in November 2013 requires three days’ notification before a demonstration can take place and gives the Interior Ministry the right to “cancel, postpone or move” the protest if it determines protesters will “breach . .. the law. ” Broad new counterterrorism laws have expanded the definition of terrorism to include civil disobedience this gives prosecutors latitude to roll over   pretrial detention periods, in many cases without limit. And once a case gets to court, a compliant judiciary, long regarded as hostile to the opposition, has been unforgiving in its sentencing. “This is an extraordinarily conservative institution,” one official told me, explaining that judges tend to favor a “maximalist approach” to eliminate threats to the public order and safeguard their own interests. “They are overwhelmingly the children of judges, like gondoliers in Venice. It is a family business. ” According to the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, a watchdog group in Cairo, the minister of justice has fired almost half of the 75 judges who called for more democracy in an open letter to Sisi and replaced them with  . Two hundred others have been sidelined with administrative chores or have left the country. One of the most notorious magistrates, Mohammed Nagy Shehata, known as the “executioner judge,” a holdover from the Mubarak era, has handed out hundreds of lengthy prison terms and death sentences to   activists. In early 2016, Shehata sentenced three young members of April 6, who were attending a memorial service for a murdered comrade when they were arrested, to life terms for protesting without a license, possessing fireworks and spreading false information. (The sentences were later reduced to 10 years.) In June 2014, another Cairo judge sentenced 25 peaceful demonstrators, some of them teenagers, to 15 years for violating the protest law, blocking roads and attacking public institutions. “Kids are going to jail for four or five years,” Dawoud said, “being portrayed as anarchists and terrorists. No country in the world jails its young people for that long for demonstrating peacefully. ” During the Mubarak era, he said, “I would take part in demonstrations and spend three days in a police station. We got released because we were students, and they were not going to destroy our future. There is no more of that kind of thinking. ” Sameh Samir, a lawyer with the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights, a nongovernmental organization that defends many protesters, told me that his office has been overwhelmed by the caseload. “They are making random arrests, just sweeping people off the streets,” he said. The regime has hampered the ability of human rights groups like Samir’s to defend protesters, freezing their bank accounts and making it increasingly difficult to accept foreign funds, often a lifeline for such organizations. Ten and a Half Kilometers Camp, a collection of concrete bungalows surrounded by a fence just off the    highway, typifies the prisons of the Sisi era. Built under Mubarak to house violent Islamists, the camp today serves as a pretrial detention facility for Islamists and a handful of secular political prisoners. A founding member of April 6 named Ayman, who did not want his last name mentioned, landed there in December 2015 after participating in an illegal protest. Thrown into a      cell with 35 Islamists, he slept amid a crush of other prisoners on a blanket on the concrete floor. They defecated in a hole surrounded by curtains and were never permitted to leave the cell. “You need to take the word ‘privacy’ out of your dictionary if you are going to survive,” he told me. After two weeks, Ayman was moved into a tiny disciplinary cell with 11 other prisoners to await interrogation. They shared a few thin blankets, drank unpurified water from a rusty pipe and survived on one piece of stale bread and cheese each day. A fluorescent light in the   ceiling shone day and night. “We learned how to get it unscrewed by standing on each other’s shoulders,” he said. “We had to use a little acrobatics. ” Twice during his 26 days in the unit, he was shaken awake in the night, blindfolded, taken to an interrogation room and questioned for hours. “They asked me how the hierarchy of April 6 worked, how do we communicate,” he said. “I didn’t give them any names. ” The authorities finally moved him to Al Kanatar Prison, 15 miles from Cairo, where, after 20 days, a judge ordered his release. Ayman said that many of the prisoners he met were from the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political organization that briefly held power after Mubarak. The group formally renounced violence in the early 1970s, but Ayman watched his cellmates grow hardened in prison. “The torture and unjust imprisonment for long periods without clear charges or trial dates created human bombs,” he said. “Each one of them was just waiting to get out. They are so thirsty for revenge. ” Last April, when he heard that the authorities were again looking for him, Ayman sought refuge in South Africa, where his wife and two young daughters eventually joined him. Egypt’s slide back into authoritarianism wasn’t foreordained. Today the leaders of April 6 admit that they weren’t prepared for the challenges that followed their initial success. Many of them were barely out of their teens Maher, from a politically aware,   family in Cairo, had built the group online, connecting on Facebook and embracing   techniques that he learned while demonstrating for human rights and judicial independence with a small   movement. He was beaten and jailed repeatedly. The group took its name from the date of a   strike in Cairo that Maher organized in 2008 in solidarity with textile workers in the Nile Delta. That led to small demonstrations against corruption and police brutality, which were quickly broken up by Mubarak’s security forces. Then, on Jan. 25, 2011, a protest march on Egypt’s National Police Day exploded into a nationwide movement. Late that morning, Maher watched with amazement as crowds filled Tahrir Square and said: “We made a revolution! We made a revolution!” Days after the Feb. 11 resignation of Mubarak, one of the world’s   tyrants, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, a transitional military body, sent a bus to pick up Maher and three other protest leaders and took them to a villa owned by   officials. Sisi, then the intelligence chief, and two other generals greeted them respectfully, Maher recalled. “Sisi said: ‘You are heroes. You did miracles. You brought down Mubarak. You did something we failed to do for years. But now we need you to stop demonstrating. ’’u2009” Maher and the others rejected Sisi’s request. “We said: ‘The revolution is not complete. We need to change the cabinet, change the structure of the government.’ We kept sending them demands. ” Over the next six months, Maher met with Sisi three times. “We said the same, and he said the same. ‘We need to stop demonstrating stand together against the enemies.’ Sisi always hated the protests. ” After Mubarak’s downfall, Maher traveled to the United States and captivated students in gatherings at New York University, Harvard, M. I. T. and American University, and met with leaders of the   community. In Europe, he talked politics and revolution with the first vice president of the European Commission, Catherine Ashton officials from the United Nations Human Rights Council and Green Party and Social Democratic representatives to the European Parliament in Brussels. Western diplomats and politicians underestimated the structural weakness of the secular democrats, the   appeal of the Islamists and the entrenched power of the “deep state”  —   military intelligence and the state security apparatus. Back in Egypt, the April 6 leaders searched for a strategy. “We didn’t have a vision,” admitted Walid Shawky, a dentist and a member of the April 6 Political Committee. “We didn’t have an answer for what comes next. ” Maher struggled to articulate an ideology, vaguely describing the group’s leanings as “social democratic, social liberal”  —   somewhere between unfettered capitalism and   communism. There were debates between those who wanted to transform April 6 into a secular political party that would challenge the Muslim Brotherhood and those, like Maher, who believed that such a transformation was too ambitious. The Brotherhood “outnumbered us 10 to one,” he told me. “I thought that being a pressure group to write a new Constitution would be a better role for us. ” April 6 began an awareness campaign throughout the country. “We used to go out with slide projectors in rural areas, teaching people of all the [human rights] violations made by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces,” recalls Mamdouh Gamal, one of tens of thousands of youths who joined the movement in the immediate aftermath of the revolution. He has since left it. While April 6 members continued their activism, the Islamists cemented their political advantage. The Muslim Brotherhood won parliamentary and presidential elections but enraged much of the population when it tried to draft a Constitution based largely on fundamentalist Islamic principles. By the end of 2012, Egypt was in chaos. “There were street fights, people at one another’s throats, a real possibility of civil war,” remembered Dawoud, the journalist. April 6 gave its support to Tamarod, a   movement that gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures favoring early elections that, they believed, would remove the Muslim Brotherhood from power. Maher believed that they had the military’s support. Instead, on July 3, 2013, Sisi went on television and announced that he was deposing President Mohammed Morsi and seizing power. He suspended the Constitution, disbanded Parliament, declared a state of emergency, ordered the arrests of Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders and then in August began the deadly attack on the Brotherhood protest camp at Rabaa. After nearly two years of turmoil, many Egyptians were desperate for stability, and April 6 suddenly found itself lacking any popular support. “At that time, there was not one person in the street who was against Sisi,” recalled Amal Sharaf, the April 6 spokeswoman for the foreign media. After the killings, Sharaf said, “we tried to make protests, and we got beaten. People with hammers and knives were chasing us. There was a lot of ugliness. ” Days after the coup, the interim president, Adly Mansour, a former Constitutional Court chief justice who was appointed by Sisi as a figurehead civilian leader, summoned Maher to the presidential palace. “He was asked to go on trips to Western countries and say, ‘This was not a coup, but something the people had asked for,’’u2009” said Ayman, the April 6 founding member. “Maher and the whole leadership of the movement refused to do it. We said, ‘This is a military coup  —   people asked for an early election. ’’u2009” (Maher won’t comment on the incident.) The movement’s leaders publicly denounced the Rabaa killings as a “massacre,” further antagonizing Sisi and sealing the group’s fate. Maher was arrested on Nov. 30 and sent to Tora Prison. In 2014, as Maher and other April 6 leaders languished in jail, Egypt’s Court for Urgent Matters, one of Sisi’s favored tools for stifling dissent, banned the group’s activities, accusing it of espionage and defaming the state. Last winter, Amr Ali, who succeeded Maher as the April 6 general coordinator, received a   sentence for conspiring to overthrow the government and joining an illegal organization, another crippling blow to the movement. “The case against us is not finished,” said Mohammed Samy, the acting coordinator of the outlawed movement. “They don’t need to capture that many people now, so they put this case in the drawer, and when they want to recapture us, they will open it again. ” The government remains resolute. “April 6 was not at all a peaceful organization,” said a top Egyptian official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. “It was an anarchist movement that used violence against the security forces and incited violence. They said, ‘We have to topple the government. ’’u2009” When I pressed him for an example of such violence, he cited, without offering proof, an April 6 member who, during the revolution, “seized a gun from a police officer and threw it in the Nile. ” One November afternoon in Cairo, I rode in a taxi along the bank of the Nile, passing the former site of Mubarak’s riverside National Democratic Party headquarters, now an empty lot. Set on fire and gutted by mobs of angry protesters in February 2011, the abandoned hulk was finally torn down more than a year ago, ridding the regime of a potent symbol of revolt. “We woke up one morning, and it was gone,” my translator told me. We soon found ourselves in Tahrir Square. Though protests still take place there from time to time  —     students assembled there last June to denounce corruption in Egypt’s abysmal education system  —   the police quickly break them up with tear gas. While the stability imposed by Sisi has gained him wide support, he has staked his presidency on an economic turnaround that has not materialized. Tourism has collapsed, and the regime spent over $8 billion on a huge expansion of the Suez Canal, a money pit that depleted   supplies and set off shortages of sugar, medicine and rice. Sisi alienated poor Egyptians by raising the price of gasoline and instituting a tax to obtain a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Two days before my arrival last November, the regime devalued the Egyptian pound by 48 percent to combat a black market that has siphoned almost all hard currency from the legal economy. Many economists applauded the move, but the punitive effects were being felt by everyone from   drivers to an administrator at an international high school in Cairo. The school was suddenly facing a doubling of its expenses, because its expatriate teachers were paid in euros. “We may not last until the end of the year,” he told me. I met the school administrator at an evening soiree, attended mostly by gay Egyptians, including my translator, and hosted by a European diplomat at his elegant apartment in a building a few blocks from the Nile. The atmosphere was festive but rife with anxiety: In a sweeping crackdown, the police have been shutting gay bars and nightclubs, entrapping gay people using online dating sites, even raiding private homes in the name of debauchery and prostitution laws. The persecution has gone far beyond the Mubarak regime’s sporadic attacks on the gay community. Over crème brûlée and Egyptian red wine, I chatted with a towering bearded man who had spent four years as a closeted member of a Salafist sect in Alexandria. “I hated myself, and I thought being a Salafist would cure me of being gay,” he told me. He had fallen in love with another fundamentalist, a Syrian who jilted him and joined the refugee flood to Europe. The man had returned to the gay scene in Alexandria and Cairo  —   but the oppressive atmosphere has made it nearly impossible for him to mix socially with other gay men. “We have never seen anything like this in Egypt,” he told me. “People are terrified. ” (A few days after I left Egypt, my translator would seek, and eventually gain, humanitarian asylum in Germany, claiming that the crackdown on gay Egyptians had endangered him.) Around midnight, the host cleared furniture from the salon, and the crowd gathered around the perimeter of the room to watch the evening’s entertainment. A lithe,   man danced erotically around another man swathed in a black burqa, prying apart the second man’s legs and removing a beach ball, a teddy bear and other objects and tossing them around the salon. The lewdly choreographed show, taking place out of sight of Sisi’s ubiquitous security forces, seemed an act of defiance. Yet I was asked repeatedly not to identify the location of the party or anything else that might compromise those in attendance. The country’s security forces have displayed their unbridled power in other startling ways. Last year, Ziad Hassan Qenawy, a    from the Cairo exurb of Al Shorouk, was detained at Cairo Airport with his father and hauled into court to face sentencing for six guilty verdicts handed down in absentia, ranging from theft to “resisting the authorities. ” Each was punishable by a year in prison. The boy’s lawyer, Mahmoud Al Shinawy, calls the case a revenge plot against the father, an affluent businessman who had refused to submit to a police shakedown. In the courtroom, Shinawy told me: “I had to lift Ziad up so the judge could see him. When the judge saw me carrying the boy, he asked me, ‘Why are you bringing your son to the court?’ I said: ‘This is not my son. This is the defendant. ’’u2009” Ziad was given suspended sentences, “but he now has a criminal record,” Shinawy said. “It will last for his entire life, and he will lose many rights. ” Egypt’s byzantine justice system seemed to be assiduous in sweeping up toddlers. Last February, a military court found    Ahmed Mansour Qorani Sharara and 115 others guilty of killing three people and damaging private and public property during a   Brotherhood demonstration. Ahmed was sentenced to life in prison, but the verdict was later thrown out of court. The police insist that it was a case of mistaken identity and that the real culprit, a teenager, is still being sought. One November evening, I met my translator at El Horreya cafe, an    beer hall that served as a refuge for protesters fleeing the crush of humanity and occasional clouds of tear gas in Tahrir Square. Today it is a popular   hangout for journalists, leftists and members of Cairo’s beleaguered L. G. B. T. community. Together we headed for a meeting with an original member of the April 6 movement who has also been caught up in the purgatory of Sisi’s courts and prisons. He had spent five months in jail for organizing the April 2016 protest against Sisi’s transfer of two uninhabited islands, Tiran and Sanafir, in the Gulf of Aqaba, to Saudi Arabia, apparently in a quid pro quo for desperately needed hard currency, gas and oil. (Egypt’s State Council, in a rare display of independence, later ruled the transfer illegal.) The activist had been given a provisional release weeks earlier and had broken a few appointments with me already, but this evening, he promised to make an appearance. My translator and I walked through the downtown streets, past stray dogs and cats feasting on piles of garbage in alleys, past derelict   buildings that looked dangerously close to collapse. After 15 minutes, we arrived at the Eish and Malh bistro, a      joint. The April 6 organizer, a skinny    with square   glasses, a white Tour de France shirt, a thin beard and a mop of curly black hair, was smoking furiously at a round table in the center of the large room. He insisted on being quoted anonymously, only to change his mind, saying, “I don’t want anyone who reads this to feel it’s a fabrication,” before anxiously changing his mind again. He recounted how plainclothes security men had jumped out of five cars at the April demonstration, punched and   him, then pushed him inside one of the vehicles and blindfolded him on the way to the security headquarters. He spent the next five months in pretrial detention, before a judge ordered his strictly supervised release. Every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday afternoon, in a ritual that mimics Maher’s, he walks or takes a   from his home to the local police station and sits on a bench for two hours, a humiliating routine that “has made it impossible for me to have a normal life,” he told me, lighting another cigarette. Around us, young Egyptians smoked, ate pizza and worked on their MacBooks, having settled back into their quotidian lives six years after Egypt’s aborted revolution and three years after Sisi’s military coup. At the end of five months, the organizer must appear again before a judge  —   who could renew his probation or send him back to jail. He checked his watch and told me he could talk for only 10 minutes more. He was worried that he would be picked up again if he stayed any longer. “I know that I am always being observed, and it drives you to an obsession,” he said. “I have thought about going abroad, but I need to be more psychologically stable first. I need to have the safe feeling, so that I can organize my life again. ” (His anxieties about being rearrested proved well founded. In February, the police detained him without explanation for six hours when he arrived late for that day’s scheduled detention, he was sent back to prison for 18 days.) As he stood up to leave the pizza parlor, I asked him if the campaign for democracy had accomplished anything. “I don’t believe it was a waste,” he told me after a pause. “It created a feeling, a space, even if we don’t have that now. Even if the people are afraid again, that experience was so important. In spite of everything, I believe it was worth it. ” In February, I returned to Cairo to meet Maher, who was released from prison on Jan. 5. As the April 6 leader prepared to report for his own far stricter surveillance, I asked him whether this routine, a constant reminder of the unyielding power of the state, demoralized him. Maher shrugged. He had recently finished reading Samuel Huntington’s 1991 book, “The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late 20th Century,” and he believed that history would prove his efforts worthwhile. “Huntington wrote that waves of revolution are greater than waves of counterrevolution,” Maher said. “So it’s three steps forward, two steps back. ” A friend picked up Maher at his home, and I followed them in my car to the station. The sun was sinking low over the desert as I drove down the wide street leading from Maher’s home, past shabby apartment blocks with laundry drying on every balcony and stunted palm trees lining the meridian. I parked at the bottom of a hill, across the street from the gated police compound, an Egyptian flag fluttering over the entrance. The wail of a muezzin wafted across the neighborhood four officers stood inside a   guard post just before the gate. The driver embraced Maher and then motored away. Maher wore his woolen ski cap and carried a black satchel containing a novel and a dinner that Reham had prepared for him. “It’s a surprise,” he told me, hoisting the bag over his shoulder. “I’ll find out what it is when I get inside. ” Then he crossed the road, walked past the four unsmiling policemen and disappeared into the shadows.",0
20407,20407,House G.O.P. May Seek to Punish Democrats for Gun Control Sit-In - The New York Times,Emmarie Huetteman and Jennifer Steinhauer,"WASHINGTON  —   Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, said Tuesday that Democrats who essentially seized the House floor last month to protest the lack of votes on gun legislation might be punished for breaking House rules. The behavior was not “becoming of the U. S. Congress,” Mr. McCarthy told reporters. He said he had been told that Democrats had mistreated House staff members and had perhaps even damaged congressional furniture during their    protest. Mr. McCarthy said that he and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, would soon meet with the House    to discuss investigative paths and possible ramifications for the Democrats. “This is not the way the House should work,” Mr. McCarthy said. “You first have to know all the facts. Action has to be taken on behavior taken toward professional staff. ” But Mr. McCarthy’s comments seemed more indicative of the gulf between the parties than of any real likelihood of punishment for Democrats. Censure of individuals seems very unlikely, given how many participated, and any attempts to penalize them could backfire, with Democrats wielding any such penalty as a badge of honor for their willingness to take on the majority. Filming and streaming video in the House  —   which the Democrats did after the regular television feed ended when Republicans gaveled the House into recess  —   are violations of the chamber’s rules. Other potential violations include standing in the well of the House floor and cutting off debate. An outside group has made a referral to the Office of Congressional Ethics regarding   solicitations issued during the  . As Democrats considered their next steps on gun legislation, Mr. Ryan was to meet Tuesday evening with Representatives John Lewis of Georgia and John B. Larson of Connecticut, the organizers of the  . But the outcome seemed predetermined: Mr. Ryan, who has dismissed the protest as “a political stunt,” suggested in an interview on a Wisconsin radio program  earlier Tuesday that he would not bring up Democratic proposals for a vote. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, scheduled a news conference with advocates for Wednesday morning to keep pushing Republicans, who could face significant risks in voting on gun legislation in a contentious election year. Republicans said they intended to hold a vote this week on a measure to prevent terrorists from obtaining guns. Under the bill, the government could block the sale or transfer of a gun if it demonstrated to a judge within a few days that an individual may have links to terrorism. Similar legislation recently failed in the Senate after Democrats panned it as toothless. “The lengths the House Republican leadership will go to follow the N. R. A. ’s marching orders know no bounds,” said Drew Hammill, Ms. Pelosi’s spokesman. House Democrats made it clear that they would not stand down and were keeping their options open as they returned from the Fourth of July recess. Last week, more than 60 Democrats participated in rallies, news conferences and other events around the country on a declared “national day of action,” trying to energize supporters and keep up pressure on Republican leaders. Speaking from the House floor before their meeting, Mr. Larson called on Mr. Ryan to hold votes on measures that would restrict access to guns for those on the government’s   list and expand background checks. Urging him to remember that “he is, indeed, speaker of the entire House,” Mr. Larson said that “we’re prevailing upon the decency of the other side, their understanding of the Constitution, their understanding of the rules of the House. ” Representative Tom McClintock, Republican of California, said Democrats had engaged in “one of the most disgraceful and childish breaches of the institution” by seizing the House floor on June 22. “They certainly have a right to their opinions,” he said. “They have a right to express those opinions on the House floor, and they have a right to use all of the procedures of the House to act on their opinions.

Pollak,"President Barack Obama’s National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, allegedly ordered surveillance of Donald Trump’s campaign aides during the last election, and maintained spreadsheets of their telephone calls, the Daily Caller reports. [The alleged spreadsheets add a new dimension to reports on Sunday and Monday by blogger Mike Cernovich and Eli Lake of Bloomberg News that Rice had asked for Trump aides’ names to be “unmasked” in intelligence reports. The alleged “unmasking” may have been legal, but may also have been part of an alleged political intelligence operation to disseminate reports on the Trump campaign widely throughout government with the aim of leaking them to the press.  At the time that radio host Mark Levin and Breitbart News compiled the evidence of surveillance, dissemination, and leaking  —   all based on mainstream media reports  —   the mainstream media dismissed the story as a “conspiracy theory. ” Now, however, Democrats are backing away from that allegation, and from broader allegations of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, as additional details of the Obama administration’s alleged surveillance continue to emerge. The Daily Caller reports: “What was produced by the intelligence community at the request of Ms. Rice were detailed spreadsheets of intercepted phone calls with unmasked Trump associates in perfectly legal conversations with individuals,” diGenova told The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group Monday. “The overheard conversations involved no illegal activity by anybody of the Trump associates, or anyone they were speaking with,” diGenova said. “In short, the only apparent illegal activity was the unmasking of the people in the calls. ” The surveillance and spreadsheet operation were allegedly “ordered one year before the 2016 presidential election. ” According to a Fox News report on Monday, former White House aide Ben Rhodes was also involved. Rhodes and Rice were both implicated in a disinformation campaign to describe the Benghazi terror attack in Sep. 2012 as a protest against a YouTube video. Rhodes also boasted of creating an “echo chamber” in the media to promote the Iran deal, feeding stories to contrived networks of “experts” who offered the public a steady stream of   propaganda. On Monday, Rhodes retweeted a CNN story quoting Rep. Jim Himes ( ) claiming that the alleged unmasking was “nothing unusual. ” To the extent they have reported the surveillance story at all, CNN and other news outlets have focused on Trump’s tweets last month that alleged President Obama had “wiretapped” Trump Tower, describing the claims as unfounded. CNN continued treating story dismissively on Monday, with The Lead host Jake Tapper insisting allegations of Russian interference in the election were more important than what he referred to as the president’s effort to distract from them. Later in the day, host Don Lemon declared he would ignore the surveillance story and urged viewers to do likewise. The potential abuse of surveillance powers for political purposes has long troubled civil libertarians, and could affect the   of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendments Act later this year.

Three years ago I did a blood-test and found that my B12 level was 179 and a normal would be up to 600,but still my doctor wasn’t convinced and he told me that I was borderline.So I started taking 1000mg everyday and my depression started to ease instantly.
You see, the problem with doctors is that they dont look at the real cause but only at the symptoms,they dont want to stop the cause,cos it will make you stop visiting,beside the fact that above all, the real cause before my B12 deficiency was that I recently had been through a traumatic situation and in order for the body to cope it releases cortisol and adrenaline which in turn eats up all your stored vitamins not just B12,so I also started taking magnesium and zinc as I also later discovered that I was also deficient in.
If you go back to your past before your the depression started you realize that there was trigger,say a bereavement of someone very close to you,a repossession of your house,news that a sibling has something terminal,in short, a very traumatic(shock) situation.
You said so yourself,you stopped taking and reoccurrence took place,which in turn means,you were doing what the doctor said,masking your problem,treating the symptoms and not the cause",1
20410,20410,Surprising Progress in Newtown Families’ Suit Against Maker of the AR-15 Rifle - The New York Times,Kristin Hussey and Lisa W. Foderaro,"For two years, a group of families in Newtown, Conn. quietly laid the groundwork for a legal case against the maker and sellers of the assault rifle that on Dec. 14, 2012, claimed 26 lives  —   and shattered their own  —   in less than five minutes. The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was carried out with an   a   assault rifle that has surfaced in recent mass shootings, like Aurora, Colo. and San Bernardino, Calif. On the eve of a hearing to determine whether the lawsuit can proceed, a rifle similar to the   was used yet again  —   in an attack early Sunday at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla. ,the deadliest shooting in American history. The legal challenge faces long odds, and a key hearing next week will determine its future. But the lawsuit has already progressed further than many had expected  —   a Connecticut judge has set a trial date and has ordered the defendants to turn over documents  —   and no matter the outcome, it represents a muscular campaign against the powerful gun industry. The lawsuit seeks to overcome the broad immunity given to gun makers and sellers under a 2005 federal law, protecting them from liability when guns are used in a crime. But there is a small window for holding companies accountable, including instances of   negligent entrustment, in which a gun is carelessly given or sold to a person posing a high risk of misusing it. The 10 Newtown plaintiffs argue that the   is a weapon of war  —   its cousin, the   was the rifle of choice in Vietnam  —   and therefore should never have been marketed to civilians. They say, in effect, that the availability of a   weapon capable of inflicting such rapid carnage constitutes such negligence. “The novelty of the approach is that it doesn’t depend upon an argument that the manufacturer knows that a particular shooter is a   buyer,” said Heidi Li Feldman, a professor at Georgetown University Law School, who has followed the Newtown litigation. “The novelty is that it substitutes the general public for a particular individual. ” The timing of the attack in Orlando, where 49 people were fatally shot, may invigorate and inflame the legal challenge against the gun industry.   advocates and victims’ rights groups have embraced the case as a way to knock down stalwart gun protections, while gun makers and dealers are watching the case intently. Eighteen months after it was filed, the lawsuit  —   naming the manufacturer, Remington the wholesaler and a local retailer  —   is still in the early stages. But the case has not yet been tossed out of court. Even some plaintiffs were startled when Judge Barbara N. Bellis of State Superior Court, who has yet to rule on a final effort to quash the case, set a trial date  —   two years from now  —   and ordered the defendants to disclose marketing materials and other internal documents. Also central to the case is the way that gun makers and dealers promote assault rifles. Just before a hearing in April, Bill Sherlach, whose wife, Mary, a school psychologist, was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting, said he was eager to see company memos. “We look forward to the discovery process, where we can see what goes on behind the curtain,” Mr. Sherlach said outside the courthouse in Bridgeport. The defendants have been vigorously seeking to have the lawsuit thrown out, and they have one last chance at a hearing on Monday in which both sides will make their cases. The judge has until October to decide whether the case will go to trial. The gun companies had asked Judge Bellis to delay the discovery phase until she ruled on the defendants’ motion to strike the case. The judge denied the defendants’ request, saying that the plaintiffs had waited long enough and that the parties should start exchanging information immediately. The Sandy Hook families’ legal team has requested numerous documents relating to the marketing of the   as well as the companies’ desired customer base and use of video games for promotion, among other things. Mark Barden recalled watching his wife, Jacqueline, at the computer in the first weeks after their    son, Daniel, died in the 2012 shooting. “She was trying to research how the kid around the corner got his hands on a military rifle designed for combat,” Mr. Barden said, “and carried it into our son’s school to murder him. ” Using an   model known as the Bushmaster, Adam Lanza, a disturbed    who lived near the Bardens, shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School. In less than five minutes, he fired 154 rounds. His mother, Nancy Lanza, whom he also killed, had legally purchased the weapon. The Bardens were stunned, they said, to see how gun companies advertised the weapons online to the general public, using militaristic language and macho phrases like “Get your man card” and “The opposition will bow down. ” The plaintiffs’ lawyer, Joshua D. Koskoff, contends that the  ’s overwhelming firepower makes it a poor choice for home defense, hunting and recreation. “But there is one civilian activity in which the   reigns supreme: mass shootings,” the lawsuit said. Assailants “have unleashed the rifle’s lethal power into our streets, our malls, our places of worship and our schools. ” On Sunday, Mr. Koskoff said the carnage of the Orlando attack showed how “unreasonably lethal” the   is. “It’s no more a gun than a tank is a car,” he said in an interview. The   which dates to the 1950s, is one of the most popular weapons in history, with dozens of gun makers issuing their own models. Several million are in American hands, according to expert estimates, despite a     ban that expired in 2004. The National Rifle Association calls the   “America’s rifle. ” As the   ban was ending, Congress began debate on the gun immunity bill. A University of Michigan Law School professor, Sherman J. Clark, wrote a letter to lawmakers arguing against the proposed law. More than 70 law professors signed the letter, which said the bill represented a “substantial and radical departure” from American tort law. “The law provides to firearms makers and distributors a literally unprecedented form of tort immunity not enjoyed or even dreamed of by any other industry,” the letter said. In late 2005, the House of Representatives voted to approve the immunity law, officially called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, and six days later, President George W. Bush signed it into law. Remington, the company based in North Carolina that made the Bushmaster gun used by Mr. Lanza, sold one million firearms last year, according to company filings. But while sales of handguns rose, the Bushmaster    rifles languished. Typically, mass shootings and terrorist acts bolster sales of assault rifles. In its most recent financial filing, Remington wrote that “after the tragic events” in Paris and San Bernardino, the company noticed “a strong but disciplined demand” for a   version of its Bushmaster rifles. Dr. Garen Wintemute, a public health researcher at the University of California, Davis, said sales of all types of guns rose after mass shootings. As for why purchases of assault rifles increase, he said: “Our informed guesswork is that it’s strategic buying  —   buy it now because you won’t be able to later. One unanswered question is when there is such a spike, how much of that is new purchasers and how much is people buying additional firearms. ” In a motion filed on Friday to strike the Newtown lawsuit, Remington called the plaintiffs’ arguments a “strained effort to evade the immunity provided to firearm manufacturers” under the 2005 federal law. The brief argues that the “negligent entrustment” exception applies to gun sellers and dealers, not a gun maker like Remington. Of course, if Judge Bellis does allow the case to proceed, the eventual outcome is uncertain. “Trial court judges do not really go for   theories or highly novel adaptations of established theories,” said Professor Feldman of Georgetown. “It goes against their experience and the nature of their job. ”",0
20411,20411,Alleged ‘Hidden’ NBC News Site Prepares To Announce Hillary Clinton Victory Before Election,Starkman,"It’s the sort of story that only feeds existing suspicions that the upcoming presidential election is being rigged to install Hillary Clinton in the White House regardless of the true vote count. 
Via TruthAndAction 

It strikes directly at the heart of the integrity of our election process and has the potential to cast doubt on the legitimacy of candidates who are declared the winners. The story in question appeared on the Infowars website, and while some of the details cannot be confirmed, it’s worth a look .


Elections in the United States do not have a perfect record of being free from attempts to manipulate the results through fraud. As reprehensible as that may be, it’s not entirely unexpected considering what’s at stake. Aggressive efforts to insure the integrity of our elections and the prosecution of those who would corrupt them are essential to giving the winning candidates the legitimacy they deserve.
All of this has the potential to go out the window this year as accusations of voter fraud through the manipulation of the counting of the ballots are already rampant.
A recent story appearing on the Infowars news site claims to show that one TV station is already preparing to announce a Clinton victory.
A NBC station was caught posting election results showing a Hillary Clinton victory days before the election, fueling concerns that the mainstream media is conditioning the public to accept a rigged election favoring Hillary.
Political activists discovered a hidden web site for WRCB out of Chattanooga, Tenn. showing election results with Hillary Clinton securing 343 electoral votes and 42% of the popular vote.
The web site originated from the FTP server of WorldNow, a media software company that provides real-time data – such as election results – and other media assets to local news stations.
It’s important to note that although Infowars claims that the site is a “hidden site for WRCB,” we at Truth and Action could not independently verify this . Note that Infowars states that this “hidden web site” is located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. A search of the domain name returns Ohio as the location where the domain name was registered, although that is not conclusive either as to the actual location where the site is maintained.
Even with these doubts about the authenticity of the web site under discussion, this news will do nothing to instill confidence, but will be one more factor furthering the suspicion and lack of trust surrounding the integrity of this year’s presidential election.
In fact, it dovetails nicely with the “fractional” method of counting the votes previously reported.
Election fraud expert Bev Harris was the first to uncover this method, which is also known as “vote shaving.”
“You need to have votes counted as fractions,” Harris said on The Alex Jones Show Monday. “You need the votes to be counted with decimal places, like you count money.”
“If a vote is a dollar, you also need to have cents with it. That will not show. It’s hidden.”
Vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers, which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes.
“There’s this one central computer, which at the end of the day, all the votes come to it,” Harris pointed out. “That’s where you take it. You don’t run around to 5,000 different precincts. You wait until the votes come to you, and then you have your way with them.”
All of this is incredibly troubling. One ray of hope is that if there really is a concerted effort to rig the vote for Hillary, that the Trump campaign is vigilant and prepared to take all legal measures to expose any vote fraud and insure that the ballots are counted accurately resulting in a decision that truly does represent the will of the people.

20413,20413,Little Is Off Limits as Donald Trump Plans Attacks on Hillary Clinton’s Character - The New York Times,Patrick Healy,"Donald J. Trump plans to throw Bill Clinton’s infidelities in Hillary Clinton’s face on live television during the presidential debates this fall, questioning whether she enabled his behavior and sought to discredit the women involved. Mr. Trump will try to hold her accountable for security lapses at the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and for the death of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens there. And he intends to portray Mrs. Clinton as fundamentally corrupt, invoking everything from her cattle futures trades in the late 1970s to the federal investigation into her email practices as secretary of state. Drawing on psychological warfare tactics that Mr. Trump used to defeat “Lyin’ Ted” Cruz, “Little Marco” Rubio and “ ” Jeb Bush in the Republican primaries, the Trump campaign is mapping out character attacks on the Clintons to try to increase their negative poll ratings and bait them into making political mistakes, according to interviews with Mr. Trump and his advisers. Another goal is to win over skeptical Republicans, since nothing unites the party quite like castigating the Clintons. Attacking them could also deflect attention from Mr. Trump’s vulnerabilities, such as his treatment of women, some Trump allies say. For Mrs. Clinton, the coming battle is something of a paradox. She has decades of experience and qualifications, but it may not be merit that wins her the presidency  —   it may be how she handles the humiliations inflicted by Mr. Trump. She would make history as the first woman to be a   nominee, yet she would also be viewed, in part, through the prism of her husband’s flaws. Some political allies and friends, while disgusted with Mr. Trump, see a certain cosmic symmetry at work: After decades of fighting what she once called “the politics of personal destruction,” Mrs. Clinton will reach the White House only if she survives one more crucible of sordid and scandalous accusations. “She is so prepared to be president, but holding her head high and staying dignified during the campaign is probably what will help her the most,” said Melanne Verveer, a longtime friend and former chief of staff to Mrs. Clinton. “Trump is yet another way she will be tested personally  —   one of her greatest tests yet. ” Mrs. Clinton has often flourished in the wake of boorish behavior: her husband’s affair with Monica Lewinsky, Kenneth W. Starr’s investigation of her husband, the congressional impeachment proceedings. Women rallied to her side during her 2000 Senate race after her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, invaded her personal space during one debate, and they helped her win the 2008 New Hampshire primary shortly after Barack Obama dismissively said she was “likable enough. ” Yet Mr. Trump said he was determined not to fall into those traps. In a telephone interview, he noted that women did not like seeing Mrs. Clinton insulted or bullied by men. He said he wanted to be more strategic, by calling into question Mrs. Clinton’s judgment in her reaction to Mr. Clinton’s affairs  —   people close to the couple have said she was involved in efforts to discredit the women  —   and in her response to crises like Benghazi. “Just getting nasty with Hillary won’t work,” Mr. Trump said. “You really have to get people to look hard at her character, and to get women to ask themselves if Hillary is truly sincere and authentic. Because she has been really ugly in trying to destroy Bill’s mistresses, and she is pandering to women so obviously when she is only interested in getting power. ” He acknowledged that Republicans tried to discredit her judgment in the marathon Benghazi hearing in the fall, to little avail. But he said that he would be more pointed and memorable in linking her to the failings and deaths in Libya, and that the debate would have a vastly larger television audience than the hearing. Still, advisers of Mrs. Clinton pointed to her   with the   Benghazi committee as a sign of her unflappability. “From Rick Lazio to the House Benghazi committee, there’s a long line of Republicans who set out to personally attack Hillary Clinton but ended up inflicting the damage on themselves,” a Clinton campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, said in a statement. “We know Donald Trump is the most unconventional of them all, but no matter what he throws at her, she will keep running her own campaign and won’t hesitate to call him out. ” Several Clinton advisers said they were not underestimating Mr. Trump’s ability to do some damage, acknowledging that Mrs. Clinton’s unfavorability ratings were high  —   though not as high as Mr. Trump’s  —   and that many Americans had concerns about her honesty and trustworthiness, according to polls. But these Clinton advisers expressed confidence that Mr. Trump would overreach and engender sympathy for Mrs. Clinton. Two advisers said that the campaign had done polling to test the possible effectiveness of Mr. Trump’s lines of attacks and, while not disclosing details about the data, that they were convinced that he would not seriously hurt her. Mrs. Clinton, in turn, has begun attacking Mr. Trump over his refusal to release his tax returns, suggesting he has something to hide, and over his temperament and leadership abilities by describing him as a “loose cannon. ” And political allies say that, in time, voters will see through Mr. Trump’s criticisms. “He can’t run on his   agenda because he doesn’t have one, and he can’t go after her on substantive policy because she knows so much more than he does,” said Thomas R. Nides, Mrs. Clinton’s former deputy secretary of state for management and resources. Yet Mr. Trump has been steadily underestimated during the presidential campaign. His Republican rivals were certain that voters would tire of his slashing style and his harsh language, and some political strategists were sure his lack of policy details would make him unprepared in the eyes of too many. Even one of Mrs. Clinton’s biggest assets to many Democrats  —   becoming the first female president and returning Mr. Clinton to a White House role  —   can be exploited as vulnerabilities. “We’ve never had a woman at the top of the ticket, and there will be plenty of people who’ll have a problem with her gender,” said Christina Greer, a political scientist at Fordham University. And Mr. Trump “can say that Bill Clinton was accused of rape and destroyed a girl’s life,” she added, referring to allegations by Juanita Broaddrick of a sexual assault in the 1970s and to the Lewinsky affair. With polls showing that Mr. Trump has unprecedented high negative ratings with voters and is in particular trouble with women, some Republican strategists say he has no choice but to try to drive up Mrs. Clinton’s unfavorability ratings. A recent   poll found that 57 percent of likely Trump supporters said that their votes were more to express opposition to Mrs. Clinton than to support Mr. Trump. “His best way to rally hostile Republican delegates before the convention is to show he’s a great Clinton attack dog,” said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who oversaw a “super PAC” supporting Mr. Bush in this year’s Republican race. Mark Penn, the chief strategist for Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign, and the Harvard University Center for American Political Studies have conducted polling that indicates that attacks against Mrs. Clinton over her private email server, the deaths in Benghazi and other issues would weaken her in a matchup against Mr. Trump. “The poll shows he could bring her vote down with sharp attacks, but that does not bring his vote up,” Mr. Penn wrote in an email. At a campaign rally for Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday in New Jersey, some supporters said they were concerned about the damage Mr. Trump could do. They described him as a street fighter and worried that Mrs. Clinton would not be gutsy and nimble enough to deliver a knockout punch. “Trump is a real lowbrow brawler,” said Michael Magazzu, an entrepreneur in the energy sector from Vineland, N. J. “That’s not her style. She has to counteract him, and the best way may be to keep her cool. ”",0

20415,20415,Voting Against Peace in Colombia,Mel Gurtov,"Email 
Those of us who study how to end wars rather than find new ways to prosecute them must be stunned, like many Colombians, by a popular vote there on October 2 that rejected the peace agreement between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). No one predicted that after over five decades of fighting and more than 200,000 deaths, a peace agreement that took six years to conclude would be rejected. It’s a lesson in how the power of emotion—vengefulness, specifically—and narrow self-interest can overcome good sense. The general perception of observers is that voters who suffered from the civil war wanted to see the FARC rebels punished rather than “rewarded” with the opportunity to reenter civil society and even hold a guaranteed number of seats in the national congress. 
Most civil wars end in much the same way as Colombia’s—with one side badly hurting and willing to disarm under a cease-fire, provided the government promises assistance so that the rebellious soldiers can reintegrate in civil society. Negotiations to reach such an agreement typically are arduous and often seem to be on the brink of failure. Long-held grievances come to life again and again, and it is a tribute to negotiators that they were able to come to any substantive agreement at all. So it was with high expectations that an agreement was reached, and the decision of Colombia’s president, Juan Manuel Santos, to put it to a popular vote showed his confidence that citizens weary of war would accept it. Five days after the vote, he was rewarded for his efforts with the Nobel Peace Prize. 
That Colombians did not endorse the agreement evidently owes much to the politicians who campaigned for a “no” vote, including former president Àlvaro Uribe, whose father was killed by the FARC. He argues that the peace agreement is too soft on FARC leaders, allowing them to avoid prison merely by confessing their crimes and promising to make restitution to victims. According to one observer who opposes the peace accord, “Essentially, FARC members would have received the same legal power to prosecute Colombian government officials and vice versa. The rejected deal would also have shielded an unknown number of FARC guerillas from jail for drug trafficking, recruitment of child soldiers, and other crimes.” The many thousands of people whose families were directly impacted by FARC killings and kidnappings obviously agreed. 
The razor-thin “no” vote (50.2 percent to 49.7 percent) also may be attributed to the bizarre fact that only 38 percent of eligible voters voted . Perhaps this was a Brexit-like situation in which many people stayed away from the polls on the assumption a “yes” vote was fairly certain. But the “no” voters were well entrenched, including not only Uribe’s party but also “the majority of the churches, the ELN [the National Liberation Army, the second-largest guerrilla force], business sectors . . ., and the majority of landowners, who were all against the proposed changes.” The right-wing groups not only considered President Santos’ peace plan soft on FARC; they also objected to his support of gay rights, reforms of land policy, and investment in rural development. 
It was under Uribe, not coincidentally, that the US became a major participant in Colombia’s civil war. Under “Plan Colombia” the US provided the Colombian military with advanced weapons (such as Blackhawk helicopters) and intelligence (under a top-secret multi-billion dollar CIA program) that escalated the violence and decimated the FARC’s ranks. A FARC leader is quoted as saying that it faced “an international intervention, and it took a toll.” Civilian deaths and the displacement of about seven million people followed, caused in no small part by officially sanctioned right-wing death squads. 
Some US officials believe that intervention “saved” Colombia from endless civil war by forcing FARC to the bargaining table. That is hardly an argument for peacemaking; the “no” vote was actually a defeat for the US policy of peace through war. Plan Colombia was to a great extent responsible for destroying, either through deaths or displacements, the lives of roughly 15 percent of the total population. Now the US supports a negotiated settlement, but still keeps FARC on the State Department’s Foreign Terrorist Organizations List. The Santos government and FARC have agreed to continue a cease-fire until December 31 . 
We may hope the parties will be guided by the need for rehabilitation and reconstruction rather than vengeance—for peace rather than retributive justice. 
As President Santos said , “Making peace is much more difficult than making war because you need to change sentiments of people, people who have suffered, to try to persuade them to forgive.”",1
20416,20416,California Proposes to Tax Space Travel - Breitbart,Chriss W. Street,"The California taxman wants add to taxes on space travel on top of taxing land, buildings, businesses, income, transportation and the air we breathe. [Not satisfied with being the   state in the nation, the clever folks at the Franchise Tax Board disclosed their intention to begin taxing the “Apportionment and Allocation of Income of Space Transportation Companies” under a new addition to the state tax collection enforce “Code of Regulations. ”  With space is internationally defined as all the infinity that is 62 miles or more above the earth, the 21st century commercial opportunities for the development of space seem to be creating a new lust among California lawmakers to find a whole new source of revenue. The Franchise Tax Board is proposing to tax the movement or attempted movement of people or property  —   including, without limitation, launch vehicles, satellites, payloads, cargo, refuse, or any other property  —   to space. In November, California voters passed Proposition 55 to extend the “temporary” 13. 3 percent top state tax rate on   earners until 2030, helping the state retain the highest marginal tax rate in the nation. But the state also has the highest collections in the nation for property tax, sales tax, business tax, cap and trade tax and tax on aiplanes during the minutes that they travel in the state’s airspace. California’s local governments have also been clever in tacking on novel new revenue schemes from such items as soda and plastic (or paper) bags. In 1966, the Beatles’ George Harrison wrote lyrics for the song “Taxman,” which appeared as the first track on the Revolver album. It became the theme song for a U. K. rebellion against the British Labour Party, which had set an astronomical top income tax rate and surcharge of 98 percent while Harold Wilson was Prime Minister in 1974. Those high tax rates led to most of the members of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and other top stars of the 1960s British music scene going into a form of tax exile out of the country. Harrison’s most iconic lyrics iconic include: If you drive a car, I’ll tax the street, If you try to sit, I’ll tax your seat. If you get too cold I’ll tax the heat, If you take a walk, I’ll tax your feet. Don’t ask me what I want it forIf you don’t want to pay some more‘Cause I’m the taxman, yeah, I’m the taxman, The current space tax is supposedly designed to only hit companies operating in California that generate at least 50 percent of revenue from space transportation. But the tax, if enacted, will undoubtedly be expanded later, and it would also apply to any    company that launches a missile from the Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex. Vandenberg launches have big advantages for commercial space missions because they fly southward, allowing payloads to be placed in polar and   orbit. That allows full global coverage that is difficult to achieve through launches at Cape Canaveral’s Kennedy Space Center, where missiles must fly eastward to avoid risks to major population centers.",0
20417,20417,"As Anger at O’Reilly Builds, Activists Use Social Media to Prod Advertisers - The New York Times",Michael M. Grynbaum and Sapna Maheshwari,"In this age of rage, Madison Avenue is finding itself on red alert. Advertisers are increasingly in the cross hairs of populist activists  —   aided by the power and reach of social media  —   who are demanding that brands quickly take sides on divisive social and political issues, posing a new challenge to corporations that usually prefer to stay out of the fray. After a groundswell of online anger over reports that Bill O’Reilly, the Fox News host, had settled with at least five women who accused him of harassment, more than 50 companies pulled their ads from Mr. O’Reilly’s popular prime time program. The exodus followed similar campaigns to pressure brands with ties to President Trump, like L. L. Bean, Uber and advertisers on “The New Celebrity Apprentice. ” “Americans are now demanding that their brands articulate their values and weigh in on political issues, and I think the degree to which they are expecting that is really quite new,” said Kara Alaimo, who teaches public relations at Hofstra University and worked in communications for the United Nations, the Treasury Department in the Obama administration, and the administration of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. “What social media is doing is forcing companies to make these decisions much more rapidly. ” Ad boycotts are not new: provocateurs like Don Imus and Glenn Beck lost their cable news soapboxes in part because an angry public used petitions and   campaigns to force companies to drop their sponsorship. But the   culture of social media has accelerated the process to such a degree that corporations may find themselves besieged in hours by tens of thousands of online critics. Just this week, Pepsi was excoriated for a   commercial that invoked the imagery of populist protest to sell soft drinks. A Twitter post from the Rev. Bernice King, the daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. that mocked Pepsi was reposted more than 140, 000 times. Within roughly 24 hours of the release of the ad, Pepsi pulled it and apologized. The rapidity of this cycle has tested even the   marketing giants, creating a niche for public relations specialists who say they can help companies navigate these instant social media storms. One firm offers software and training sessions that simulate “a   online attack” on a brand  —   the corporate equivalent of war games. The boycotts may give brief satisfaction to social media activists. But many of the sponsors that turned away from Mr. O’Reilly this week are still advertising on Fox News, which reaches the biggest audience on cable television. Fox says it is working with sponsors to address any concerns about “The O’Reilly Factor. ” And specialists say there will be little to no financial impact on the network in the near future, though that could change over time. Brian Wieser, a media analyst at Pivotal Research, said that for now, Fox News was essentially just shuffling inventory  —   “not unlike if you run a store and have got to figure out what shelf on which you put different products. ” In the short term, the fallout could eat into revenue for “The O’Reilly Factor” as cheaper commercials replace   brands, Mr. Wieser said, while the   worry is that advertisers could reassess the annual budgets they spend on Fox News. Even if the effect is more symbolic than financial, there is little question that social media have proved to be potent weapons. Since November, a Twitter account called Sleeping Giants has pressured brands into removing ads that appear on Breitbart News, the conservative news and opinion website with close ties to the Trump administration. The group, which posts screenshots of advertising on Breitbart, says it has influenced hundreds of brands  —   citing Kellogg, Warby Parker and Allstate  —   to block ads from appearing on the site. Sleeping Giants, whose proprietors have remained anonymous, extended its mission this week, urging its roughly 81, 000 followers to post images on Twitter of allegations about Mr. O’Reilly to a list of advertisers. The account has then praised companies that decided to pull sponsorship. Vulnerability to that kind of online backlash is the flip side of a   coin for major brands, which have spent years pursuing consumer engagement on social media. These days, big companies may try to talk like teenagers, using slang terms like “bae” and “on fleek” on their corporate accounts, or participate in viral trends like “the mannequin challenge,” an online video craze. But social media are also handy conduits for people to register their anger with brands  —   directly and en masse. “The intensity of this is a lot greater,” said Matthew Hiltzik, a former Democratic consultant who draws on his experience in   political campaigns to advise corporate clients. “Companies need to invest time and resources in developing proactive strategies that advance and protect the brand, so that they are best prepared to deal with the unexpected. ” Weber Shandwick, the public relations firm, created a simulation software and training tool called “Firebell” in 2010 to prepare clients for social media maelstroms. Its website describes a new strain of crisis “made up of a string of critical ” which can “gain momentum and mass at  . ” Firebell, introduced as one facet of responding to a crisis, is now central to the firm’s crisis management training, a spokesman said. Brands are particularly concerned that they can be unaware of where their messages are showing up until angry consumers come calling. In recent months, news outlets and activists have discovered prominent companies inadvertently financing a wide range of objectionable material online through automated ad placement, including sites that traffic in fake news and racist and   videos on YouTube. The pressure represents some whiplash for an industry that had broadly moved away from relying on content as a rough proxy for groups of people, focusing instead on targeting online ads, and to a lesser extent, television ads, by audience size, browsing habits and other user characteristics. Orkin, a   company that removed its ads from “The O’Reilly Factor,” does not buy ads on specific shows but instead purchases “broad day parts on networks that reach our target audience,” Martha Craft, a spokeswoman, said. The company added Mr. O’Reilly’s show to a “Do Not Buy” list after learning of the allegations against him, she said. This year, consumers pushed brands to distance themselves from “The New Celebrity Apprentice” because Mr. Trump remained an executive producer of the show. That effort stemmed from #GrabYourWallet, a   social media campaign that urges boycotts of companies selling   products. “We haven’t seen brands almost treated as individuals in this way before, and expected to espouse political beliefs and uphold them consistently across platforms in everything they do,” Ms. Alaimo said. Many companies are still figuring out how to cope with these situations, she said, adding that it was crucial to respond during “the golden hour of crisis. ” The term refers to the “golden hour” in emergency medicine  —   the window after a traumatic injury in which treatment is most likely to stave off death or permanent damage. Marc S. Pritchard, the chief brand officer at Procter  Gamble, the world’s biggest advertiser, has overseen global marketing for the company since 2008. He said that when he started in the role, one of the first items on his agenda was working with the media team to “renew our standards” for television and radio ads. “There were some issues where some of the content was becoming objectionable to a large portion of our consumers, whether it was too much graphic violence, too much either sex or sexual innuendo,” Mr. Pritchard said in an interview at an industry conference this week. He said that while the media landscape has radically shifted since then, his company maintains the same standards for where its ads should appear. “I was once told, very early back in my marketing career, your brands are judged by the company they keep,” he said.",0

20419,20419,Wikileaks Confirming Clinton Was Complicit in the Murder of Ambassador Stevens- The CSS Printed This Allegation Four Years Ago,Dave Hodges,"Wikileaks Confirming Clinton Was Complicit in the Murder of Ambassador Stevens- The CSS Printed This Allegation Four Years Ago The late Ambassador Stevens Wikileaks is about to confirm the story that The Common Sense Show told 4 years ago in that Ambassador Stevens was set up to die because his stories of gun-running, child trafficking and drug-running on behalf of the CIA in order to promote regime change in Libya using terrorists funded by these illegal activities, were leaking out and it was only a few months until the election. Subsequently, Ambassador Stevens had to be silenced. And Petraeus had to be put in a place where he was not forced to testify before Congress. At the same time, Clinton was broadcasting Stevens whereabouts and she refused to provide the extra protection Stevens was so desperately requesting. Being that Stevens was working for the CIA, then head of the CIA, David Petraeus, would have known about Chris Stevens activities. To protect Obama’s 2012 election, both Stevens and Petraeus had to be gone. People are asking me how I knew all of this four years ago and I say, “I had a source from inside of ARSOF who wanted the real truth to be told. Somebody who knew this nation could not afford to let Clinton ever become President”. This is an excerpt of what I wrote 4 years ago….. 
Who had Ambassador Stevens Killed and How the Petraeus Affair Factors In 
There is the reason for an event and there is the real reason behind the event. Sixty percent of all married men cheat on their spouse. The more money they make and the more power a man possesses, the more opportunity for cheating. 
I have swamp land for sale, in Florida, for anyone to purchase if they are naive enough to believe that David Petraeus, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), resigned solely based upon having an extramarital affair with the biographer-turned-mistress, Colonel Paula Broadwell. How did the affair compromise Petraeus’ position as CIA director? The FBI has concluded that it did not. 
The media has suggested that the affair began in 2006. So, the ignorant American public is supposed to believe that David Patraeus was vetted by the FBI, the Secret Service and the rest of the Obama goon squad and they did not discover the affair until AFTER Ambassador’s Steven’s murder? How convenient is that? This doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in the CIA’s and the FBI’s vetting practices now does it? Let me be clear again about this outrageous set of facts. The most powerful and presumably thorough intelligence agency was unable to detect Patraeus’ affair during the vetting process? America, this is what you are being asked to believe! 
It is abundantly clear that the extramarital affair excuse is just one more piece of excrement piled upon a growing mountain of Oba-manure perpetrated by this administration in order to cover up the fact that they had Chris Stevens murdered by the very terrorists that Stevens was running guns to on behalf of the CIA. Does Adultery Get One Fired? 
Let’s examine this event through the lens of common sense. Adultery is indeed a violation of the Military Code of Justice and senior command officers have indeed lost their careers over their sexual indiscretions. However, David Patraeus is no longer a command officer in the military and would not be subject to these prohibitions. And the adultery prohibition is rarely enforced, even in the military, and when it is, it is used as a matter of political expediency in order to get rid of an undesirable. 
As for the political “I did not have sex with the woman, Monica Lewinski,” crowd, adultery is not a career killer. And for the head of a federal agency, or for a cabinet member, unless the affair can be shown to compromise national security, it does not end the careers of unholy partakers of the forbidden fruit while serving in high government office. Petraeus decided to quit, though he was breaking no laws by having an affair, officials said. Janet and David A Tale of Two Tails 
Rumors persist that the way to get promoted in the Department of Homeland Security is to “provide services” to one’s superiors, especially for Homeland Security Director, Janet Napolitano. So if it is permissible for Janet to be serviced in exchange for a promotion , then why should David be any different when it comes to giving an exclusive to your mistresses’ journalistic desire to become his biographer? Yet Janet is on the verge of being promoted to Attorney General, despite her indiscretions and resulting law suit. Conversely, Patraeus is out of a job. But wait, the believability of this cover story gets worse! 
According to New York Times best-selling author, Aaron Klein, whom I have interviewed on my talk show , Hillary Clinton is a lesbian who surrounded herself with lesbian aides and staffers when she was the First Lady and she continues to do so as the Secretary of State. And as the Mail Online points out, why did it not seem to matter to Hillary that her husband chased anything that wore a skirt? It is because she is a serial lesbian who has had multiple affairs. Who cares? 
Take Attorney General, Eric Holder, his actions, related to the topic of sex, are the most reprehensible of them all. Brandon Darby , previously an FBI informant, is speaking out on the Department of Justice’s hesitancy to assist victims of human trafficking, in particular they are refusing to help children who have been victims of sex crimes. The obvious question is, who is Holder protecting? This inaction on the part of Eric Holder is far more reprehensible, and represents a greater violation of the public trust than do the actions of Hillary Clinton and Janet Napolitano. 
When one considers the fast and furious sexual life-styles of the senior cabinet members of the Obama administration, it is impossible to swallow the fact that Patraeus was sacked because of an affair. 
The Patraeus dismissal based upon an extramarital affair is a cover story, plain and simple. The Rats are Jumping Off the Ship 
I do not care what people do in their private lives behind closed doors. I do not care if Clinton and Napolitano are lesbians. My feelings hold true for the President, the Director of Homeland Security, the Secretary of State or the director of the CIA. However, when a fake cover story is concocted to cover up the murder of an ambassador, as it was with Chris Stevens, then it is everyone’s business. 
Many of the rats of the Obama administration are jumping ship in the aftermath of the murder of Ambassador Stevens and this explains why Patraeus was fired as CIA director. Patraeus is gone for the same reason that Hillary Clinton will soon be gone. Clinton is gone for the same reasons that Eric Holder is contemplating leaving. Congressional Hearings Regarding the Death of Stevens Begin Soon 
If Petraeus was subpoenaed before Congress in his role as CIA director, he could not invoke the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. If Hillary Clinton is subpoenaed to testify before Congress, in her role as Secretary of State, she cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. And if members of the Obama administration begin to incriminate themselves for their dirty deeds which resulted in Stevens’ death, then they implicate Obama. 
This is Obama’s potential Watergate moment. If Clinton reveals before Congress that, as the senior official that oversees diplomatic security, that she denied Stevens’ requests for extra security and that she, Holder, Patraeus and Obama watch drone footage for nearly seven hours as Stevens and his party were murdered and that these senior level Cabinet officials blocked AFRICOM Commander, General Hamm , and the Commander of Carrier Task Force 3, Admiral Gayouette from rescuing the Stevens contingent, and then had both men arrested when the tried to disobey orders and rescue Stevens in violation of these executive orders from Obama administration. 
The gravity of these events are stunning! All of these senior officials, including the President, are implicated as accomplices in Stevens murder. This is criminally negligent homicide. This is first degree murder! And why did Stevens have to be murdered? Stevens was murdered because he was running guns for the CIA to al-Qaeda operatives, first in Libya last year and in Syria this year . (EDITOR’S NOTE: WE KNOW THAT STEVENS WAS ALSO RUNNING KIDS AND DRUGS TO SUPPORT THE CIA IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ARM TERRORISTS IN THE OVERTHROW OF LIBYA.) 
Dead men tell no tales in this Middle East version of Fast and Furious. This also explains why Patraeus had to be sacked. He was the link between Stevens’ gun running and al-Qaeda since Stevens’ gun running was a CIA operation conducted under the purview of Petraeus. This account is partially confirmed by Council on Foreign Relations member, Dr Steve Pieczenik, as states that Stevens was running guns and missiles into Syria . You remember the missing hand held stinger missiles that went missing in the NATO invasion of Libya last year? Those would be the ones! Can you imagine the public’s further outcry when al-Qaeda operatives begin brining down American commercial airliners with these weapons. Even Biden would not be able to pardon this motley crew! How Will the New World Order Spin This? 
Only a month before the election, I thought Obama’s reign of terror was over. However, in the month before the election, the economic outcome appeared brighter for the first time in years. The housing market showed signs of rebounding. The stock market appeared stronger and the banks were actually talking about loosening credit. 
The George Soros voting machines came into play. The military’s vote was compromised. All the stops were pulled out to extend the heinous tyranny of Obama by the global elite. Why? The very simple and obvious reason is that with Benghazi-Gate, the elite can pull Obama’s strings in any direction they want. If Obama gets out of line, the global elite will topple his presidency and the aforementioned Obamanites will go to prison for a very long time. 
What will the next four years look like in America? Well, under the existing conditions, with Obama’s very freedom riding on the whims of the globalists, the future of America looks bleak as Obama is completely compromised. 
END OF EXCERPT FROM NOVEMBER OF 2012 
Conclusion 
When Wikileaks releases their information, and it shows that Stevens was running drugs, guns and children to support the overthrow of Libya, Clinton will come into the foreground. She repeatedly turned down Stevens request for additional protection. PEtraeus was sacked for the bogus reason of having an extramarital affair so he did not have to tell Congress what he knew because he could not hide behind the 5th Amendment. 
If this breaks before the election, Clinton cannot win. She alone set up Stevens by denying protection and transmitting by email Stevens location by email from her private server. 
We know that Stevens was murdered. What happened to Petreaus? After he was fired from the CIA, he went to work for the NWO in Belgrade where serves as the minister of propaganda. He is the chief censorship official in Belgrade. How do I know this? I was interviewed on the Voice of Belgrade radio this past summer and I was told that they had a hard time getting me by the censors and that is when I learned that Petreaus ran State-owned Belgrade media. 
Now we find out that 1,000 emails between Clinton and General Petraeus were not turned over in the original FBI investigation. These emails are going to sink the good ship Hillary. Remember, The Common Sense Show had the information about to be leaked by Wikileaks four years ago. If justice is done, Clinton will soon be doing the perp walk for the murder of Chris Stevens.",1
20420,20420,Ohio Colleges Demand Students Remain Defenseless Despite Campus Carry Law - Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,"A January 19 survey of Ohio colleges and universities found most boards and presidents determined to prohibit guns for   despite a new law allowing concealed carry permit holders to be armed on campus. [Ohio’s campus carry law was signed by Governor John Kasich (R) on December 19 after lawmakers passed the measure following the November 28 knife and car attack against unarmed Ohio State students. The law removes the state’s ban on campus carry, allowing each college and university system to allow or prohibit campus carry as they see fit.  The law takes effect on March 19, 2017. Cleveland. com surveyed “every private and   college in Northeast Ohio and every public university statewide” and found the “general consensus” was that   students would continue to be disarmed on campus by college and university policies. For example, Kent State University board of trustees chairman Lawrence Pollock said, “The university policy on deadly weapons as approved in September represents the Board’s position on this issue and we have no plans for further action. ” The policy Pollock references bars   students from possessing a firearm for   “inside any university building, facility, or vehicle, that is owned, operated or leased by the university. ” It also bars them “from possessing, storing, or using a deadly weapon while outside on university grounds, that is owned, operated or leased by the university. ” In other words, the Kent State system will continue to maintain a   campus like Virginia Tech University had in place on April 16, 2007, when 32 unarmed innocents were shot to death. Cuyahoga Community College President Alex Johnson used an email to explain that his college system will retain its   policy as well: I know this bill has been a topic of discussion across the College, and our faculty has brought various concerns to campus leadership and to me for clarification. I have been in close communication with   Board Chair Victor Ruiz and the other trustees about this matter.  ’s Board of Trustees has no intention of taking action to permit concealed carry in   facilities. In other words, Cuyahoga Community College will continue to maintain a   campus like Umpqua Community College had in place on October 1, 2015, when nine unarmed innocents were shot to death. The Ohio University faculty senate is urging the trustee executive committee to keep   students disarmed on their campuses too. The faculty senate submitted a resolution to the committee, saying: Whereas the full and free discussion of potentially controversial ideas and knowledge is essential to the academic mission of the University and Whereas the possible presence of concealed weapons in instructional spaces and faculty offices will have a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas BE IT RESOLVED that the Faculty Senate urges the Ohio University Board of Trustees to take no action that would allow concealed carry on any of our campuses in order to reaffirm our commitment to a weapon free campus. In other words, the Ohio University faculty senate wants to maintain the same kind of   policies that were in place at Sandy Hook Elementary on December 14, 2012, when a gunman entered the school and had over nine minutes without armed resistance to carry out his wickedness. He was able to kill 26 innocents during that time period. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

20421,20421,"Republicans, Who Warned of Dithering on Ebola, Now Hesitate on Zika - The New York Times",Carl Hulse,"WASHINGTON  —   Lawmakers say Washington is dithering while a dangerous epidemic threatens American shores. They suggest darkly that the government is playing down the risk to avoid panic. They warn: Don’t wait for it to arrive at the airports and establish a perilous foothold. Fear of the Zika virus today? No, those were Republicans in 2014 as they hammered the Obama administration in the final weeks of the midterm campaign for failing to react quickly and decisively enough to the possible spread of the Ebola virus, which never really became a domestic threat. The politically heated attacks cooled quickly after the election, but the message was credited with helping Republicans sow unease about the administration as they chalked up big wins in Congress. Now it is the   Congress moving slowly on providing money to combat the spread of Zika, alarming some lawmakers who fear that their colleagues do not recognize the potential consequences if the   disease begins to spread in the United States. “There is just a lack of urgency about it,” said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who added that lawmakers could find themselves facing difficult questions about a   congressional Zika response as Election Day looms this fall. “People are going to be asking, ‘Why didn’t you do anything? ’” he said in an interview. “You are going to have to have a pretty good answer, and I am not sure there is going to be one. ” Mr. Rubio has a special interest in the disease, given that the climate and conditions in his state are well known for breeding mosquitoes. He worries that even the smallest of outbreaks could send his state’s economy into a spiral as visitors stay away. “I tell people we are one   infection away from serious damage to our tourism industry,” he said. He has not been alone in clamoring for a federal fix. In February, President Obama asked Congress for more than $1. 8 billion in emergency funds to step up prevention efforts and speed a vaccine for the disease, which has been linked to serious birth defects and other health problems. Last week  —   almost four months later  —   the Senate voted to begin negotiations to try to resolve differences among the House, Senate and White House approaches. Democrats are demanding a resolution by the Fourth of July recess, but there is no guarantee that the funding legislation can be completed by then. “I just think they’re long overdue,” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, said last week. “An emergency bill could have passed  —   we’re over 100 days since the request. ” She noted that the public health community “could have been well down the road to what needs to be done in terms of prevention, in terms of research and the other aspects of stopping the epidemic. ” The issue is particularly grating at the White House, which came under siege in October 2014 over what Republicans called a lack of preparedness for Ebola. The administration believes it was unfairly maligned for political purposes by Republicans who saw an opening to make voters anxious close to the election. Mr. Obama said recently that he was having difficulty squaring Republicans’ position on Ebola with their much more casual approach to Zika, “given that I have, at least, pretty vivid memories of how concerned people were about Ebola. ” Republicans say there is no need for a furious rush since the administration agreed in April to redirect nearly $590 million, most of it previously allocated for Ebola prevention, to the effort against Zika, easing the pressure to act quickly. Some Democrats now think that move, perhaps wise from a policy and prevention standpoint, may have been a strategic mistake because it let Republicans off the hook. “I think we are fine,” said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, predicting that Republicans had done what they needed to avoid a political backlash. He said that shifting the money had provided public health experts with the resources they needed and that the necessary funds “will be there in the end. ” Negotiators working on a compromise are expected to move toward the $1. 1 billion approved by the Senate as opposed to $622 million allocated by the House. Mr. Rubio and others favor providing the full amount sought initially by the White House. As of last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had identified nearly 700 Zika infections in the continental United States, though all appeared to have been contracted elsewhere. More than 1, 000 have been counted in Puerto Rico. Public health experts are now preparing for the first case of someone’s being infected by a mosquito in the United States. Mr. Rubio worries that the federal response has fallen too far behind. “I think in some ways we are already too late,” he said. “It takes time to get this implemented. Every day that goes by is wasted. ” As they try to hold on to control of the House and Senate, Republicans should hope that Mr. Rubio is wrong and that the disease does not become a crisis in the United States. If it does, it could be Democratic attacks on Republicans for moving too slowly that go viral.",0
20422,20422,The Word a Headline Didn’t Need - The New York Times,Liz Spayd,"You can buy “Trump That Bitch” buttons and   on Amazon to show your disdain for Hillary Clinton. You can hear the word shouted at rallies for Donald J. Trump and spread across Twitter. At one event last month, a   boy standing with his mother yelled out, “Take the bitch down. ” Now, you can see the word applied to Clinton in a headline on the Opinion pages of The New York Times: “The Bitch America Needs. ” Those words appeared over the weekend above a piece that tried to reclaim that particular bit of obscenity from those trying to degrade women with it. “For more than 20 years in American politics, Mrs. Clinton has embodied what we might call Classic Bitch,” wrote Andi Zeisler, founder of a feminist organization, appropriately named Bitch Media. “She’s perceived as an interloper who challenges or threatens masculinity, entitlement and a   worldview she’s the scandal magnet who can seem as heartless and venal as any  ’  member. Worst of all, she’s the woman who accepts that she will be disliked and carries on anyway. ” Zeisler wrote a provocative piece, with plenty of good political history on the word, including its use against Clinton back in 2007, when someone at a public forum asked Senator John McCain, “How do we beat the bitch?” McCain responded, “Excellent question. ” Zeisler’s piece was an interesting read, strongly   and  . But several readers took issue both with the headline and the editors’ decision to use it. This one from Paula DiPerna of New York City was typical: “I know the piece is mere opinion, but it nevertheless represents a new low in titillation journalism, as if written by a gleeful child who just got permission to use curse words. It is a disservice to the idea of public good in that, disguised as feminism, it actually delivers nothing but tweet fodder to   forces. ” I sought out the Opinion editor Rachel Dry to ask her how the essay came about as well as the concerns highlighted in DiPerna’s letter, some of which I share. Dry says she commissioned the piece because she wanted someone to wrestle with how this particular profanity is being used against Clinton. “Certainly the word focuses one’s attention,” Dry said to my questions about its use in the headline and so frequently in the story. “But that’s what the essay is about. ” I did find the essay readable and smart, and given that the   pages are intended to throw out the welcome mat to all views, it’s hard to argue that this wasn’t a worthy offering. But I too was jolted by the headline. Have we really reached the point that it’s O. K. for The Times to refer to Clinton in bold type as “The Bitch America Needs”? Dry said she was unaware of a previous time when the word was used in a headline. What bothered me about the headline was that it seemed to come from the voice of The Times, at least when you come on it cold, as all readers do. It’s one thing for an author, under her own byline and in the context of her ideas, to write the type of opinion piece Zeisler did. But the word bitch  —   particularly when it’s lobbed at you across a room or on the street or in social media  —   is surely intended as crude and demeaning. I suspect that’s the same way Trump supporters use it. And it seems to be the way the Clinton campaign takes it, as it has made clear in the past. Dry says that when opinion editors write the headlines, they are distilling the author’s perspective, not the view or the voice of The Times. That may be, but referring to the first female presidential nominee as the right bitch for the job brings an air of legitimacy to the word that seems beyond where we are at this moment in history. The mainstream may someday apply this term to women who stand up for themselves and bust through feminine stereotypes. Until then, it remains an insult, degrading and misogynistic.",0
20423,20423,BREAKING: Riot Police Set Up To Raid & Evict Standing Rock Protesters,Quest,"We Are Change 
Police and activists protesting the Dakota Access oil pipeline are in a tense standoff over the activists’ occupation of and reportedly belonging to the pipeline developer.
So far more then 260 people have been arrested since the larger demonstrations began in August.
More than 125 of the water protectors were arrested over the weekend during multiple nonviolent direct actions aimed at halting construction of the 1,100-mile pipeline which is slated to run through four states.
Armored riot police attacked a march on Saturday with tear gas and arrested 83 people on charges ranging from assault on a peace officer to rioting and criminal trespass. Police also shot down two camera drones operated by Native American journalists.
Activists report that harassment, strip searches and beatings at the hands of North Dakota police are becoming commonplace, but the assembled tribes remain determined to block the pipeline, which they say threatens both sacred lands and the water supply for millions of people.
Our friend Derrick Broze for MintPress news reporting from the Standing Rock Reservation just tweeted out that Camps are being removed. Tasers out, pepper spray, guns, riot gear, batons, LRAD. Then after that he him self had been tazed in the conflict.

20425,20425,"Cartel Massacres, Rampant Corruption Taint Mexican Border State Elections",Ildefonso Ortiz and Brandon Darby,"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila  —   As the border state of Coahuila prepares for its upcoming gubernatorial election, the main issue that resonates with voters is how Los Zetas were able to murder and incinerate hundreds of victims while the government turned a blind eye. [In early June, the state of Coahuila will have its general elections to select the next governor, mayors, senators, and congressmen. As Breitbart Texas has been reporting, the process is closely linked to Mexican drug cartels. One of the candidates for the border city of Piedras Negras has a long list of relatives who are members of Los Zetas  including one regional commander.  Breitbart Texas has spoken with several residents of this border city who expressed their various viewpoints as to the ongoing situation in Coahuila, a state with a long history of being home to Mexican drug cartels and corrupt government officials. One of the key issues that residents kept bringing up is how state officials turned a blind eye to the various cartel massacres that took place in the state. As Breitbart Texas reported, from early 2011 to 2013, Los Zetas kidnapped, murdered and incinerated more than 300 victims from the rural communities in and around Allende. Half of those were incinerated inside the state prison in Piedras Negras.  Residents in Coahuila continue to ask themselves how Los Zetas were able to operate with complete impunity to carry out the mass executions, set fire to and destroy dozens of homes, and avoid facing any consequences. To date, government officials do not know how many people throughout the state have actually been kidnapped and murdered by cartel gunmen due to a systemic effort throughout Mexico where government officials try to downplay cartel violence.   At the time of the massacre and in the months after, the Coahuila Attorney General’s Office in the Piedras Negras and Allende region was run by Santos Vasquez Estrada and Patricia Rivera Barrera. Politically connected sources in Saltillo have revealed exclusively to Breitbart Texas that Rivera Barrera, who ignored the Allende massacre, continues to collect a director’s salary but has since been demoted to working at a PGJE archive where she handles documents tied to cases that have already been closed.  Santos Estrada has since left the PGJE and is now a criminal defense lawyer. According to Zocalo, the former prosecutor who turned a blind eye to the actions of Los Zetas became the defense attorney for Juan Manuel “Padre Meño” Riojas, a priest who has been criminally accused of having violated a seminary student. New information provided to Breitbart Texas revealed that the priest is now considered a fugitive after he went into hiding and is believed to have fled the region.  As Breitbart Texas reported, witness testimony from U. S. court cases and documents revealed that Los Zetas had free reign over Coahuila for many years where politicians sold control of the state in exchange for bribes. Some of the revelations point to Los Zetas having close ties to former governor Humberto Moreira, the brother of current governor Ruben Moreira. Both Moreira brothers were elected governors under Mexico’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) a political party that has a long history of being tied to drug cartels, Breitbart Texas reported. In Tamaulipas, two former governors are currently listed as fugitives of the U. S. Department of Justice on money laundering charges. One of those Tamaulipas governors is also wanted on drug trafficking and conspiracy charges.  Most recently, Humberto Moreira was kicked out of the PRI for running for a plurinominal congressional seat with the Partido Joven (Young Party). As Breitbart Texas reported, internal discussion within the PRI pointed to the party trying to distance themselves from Moreira in case the U. S. unveils a criminal case against him as they have done with the two former Tamaulipas governors. Most recently, Mexico’s Reforma reported on leaked documents that revealed Moreira and his relatives managed to stash away approximately $60 million in bank accounts in Monaco and the Cayman Islands. Since the publication of Reforma’s investigation, Moreira has gone on the offensive using a Facebook page and various interviews to call the outlet’s reporting a   lie.

20426,20426,How to Have a Dinner Party: Friends Not Required - The New York Times,Hannah Seligson,"Over roast chicken and autumn vegetables, our dinner party was rolling through the requisite topics  —   concerns about the rise of the far right in Germany, what it really takes to make a marriage work, where to get the best Vietnamese food in New York City  —   but still, the awkwardness was unshakable. Using the website Feastly, which, like an Airbnb for foodies, connects diners with chefs, my husband, Andrew, and I had paid $32 apiece on a recent evening to dine with six strangers. Two of them  —   the evening’s chef and her friend  —   were sitting directly behind us on a couch, forcing me to crane my neck and turn around to include them in the conversation. (To be fair, who in New York City under the age of 50 can comfortably seat eight people for dinner? And in other cities, like San Francisco, Feastly provides chefs access to shared space, something the company will start in New York City next year.) At the table, meanwhile, were a computer programmer and a   duo  —   nice people, but a random combination of personalities suggesting more a cross section of an airplane flight than an artful convocation recalling, say, parties of Elsa Maxwell or other famed hosts of yore. Long a major organizing principle of urban social life, the dinner party has taken a hit in recent years as restaurant culture has thrived, raising the bar for culinary accomplishment intolerably high. At one party I gave, much of my food went untouched, and one guest complained about the lighting. At another, guests left before dessert because the conversation had devolved into a discussion about how difficult it is to get one’s kids into preschool here. Those parties were almost two years ago. Traumatized, I hadn’t invited anyone over for dinner since. But Andrew and I had fallen into a social rut, ordering meal kits for ourselves from Blue Apron and   “Borgen,” the television drama about Danish politics. My social life was withering. Living in a coupled cocoon may be comfortable, but all the research says that connection  —   the IRL kind  —   is what makes people happy. So I wondered: Could I give dinner parties another try? Was there an app for this? But of course. Turns out, it’s possible to break bread with a new group of people every night of the week, thanks to gatherings booked through phones and computers in a continuing search to find one’s “urban tribe” (to borrow a phrase from the author Ethan Watters). Nick Ozkan, 45, says he’s acquired seven close pals from regularly attending 10 Chairs NYC, a social dining organization run by the chef Patricia Williams. “The friends range in age from their 30s to 70s,” Mr. Ozkan, who works in digital communications, wrote in an email. Ms. Williams told me that some strangers who met at her dinner parties, which cost $80 per head, have even wound up traveling together. Perhaps new friendships may be within reach after all. On the phone from San Francisco, where Feastly is based, the company’s founder, Noah Karesh, 34, said that he views “the dining room table as the original social network. ” And many agree. Feastly has hundreds of thousands of users across   cities worldwide. “There’s a growing awareness of the disconnection plaguing millennials when the majority of the social interactions you have a day are through your iPhone,” Mr. Karesh said. “Someone may have 10, 000 followers on social media but is eating dinner alone. People want to have   interactions. ” But as with an online blind date, it’s best to approach a group setup with low expectations. After the Feastly dinner, I felt defeated because the other guests didn’t seem like soul mates. But Andrew thought the evening was an unmitigated success. He argued that lifelong friendships weren’t the point. “It’s parachuting in to get a dose of varied social interaction,” he told me exuberantly on the way home. This dip into a new social pool may be easier when united around a common interest, even if that’s trying a new cuisine, as at a Balkan dinner organized by EatWith, a communal dining service, in Harlem. There Andrew and I met a young Frenchwoman studying food cultures at N. Y. U. and an affable tech professional who brought his sister who was visiting from India. The chef, Dina, told us about growing up in the former Yugoslavia and the origin of all the dishes she was serving. It’s hard to have a bad time while gobbling homemade sirnica, fluffy pastries filled with cheese. With such enticements, I got into the groove of dining with strangers. I liked it: the levity and spontaneity of topics that’s not possible when there’s a shared history, good and bad. Also, there is a certain monotony to the soirees of young marrieds that make everyone go two by two, like animals in Noah’s Ark. I liked the odd number  —   five  —   at the EatWith dinner, which, I found, liberated me from talking with other wives and the conversational constraints that go with that role. (I’m a    married woman, and other women always ask me when I’m having children  —   something I’m rarely, if ever, asked about by men.) Coming home from that dinner, which cost $63 apiece, I felt a wave of euphoria: freedom from the shackles of couple dates! (Andrew was equally excited about the blanched pear with honey dessert.) But the next morning, my enthusiasm for this newfound social outlet waned. I received an email from EatWith asking me, “Who would you eat with again?” The rating system that’s a staple of transportation services, like Uber, now extends to leisure. Susan Kim, the chief executive of EatWith, which is now in more than 200 cities around the world, told me the site “wanted an innocuous way to establish if people wanted to connect again. ” The dining service, Ms. Kim said, is helping many people fill empty places in their social lives. “We have a lot of recently divorced people using the site, because one   often takes all the friends,” she said. I understood why EatWith wanted feedback from guests about others guests. Truth be told, I was happy to see that, despite mooching cabernet from another guest because I forgot to bring wine, someone thought I “made an impression. ” Still, I wasn’t sure I wanted a nice evening out to be followed by having to rate it. “EatWith is kind of like Tinder for couples,” Ms. Kim told me. But therein lay the problem: I had been too   for Tinder as a single person! For a change of pace, I decided my next foray into social dining would be one in which someone else provides the funds for me to host people in my home, offering a modicum of social control (though also the responsibility of cleaning up). OneTable is an organization that encourages millennials  —   of all backgrounds and religions  —   to host Sabbath dinners. A nonprofit that has hosted over 3, 000 dinners in its current hub cities of New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Denver since last year, it provides what they call “a nourishment credit” of $15 per person for up to 10 people that can be used at vendors like Whole Foods, FreshDirect, Instacart, Etsy or Seamless. For young people, said Aliza Kline, the executive director of OneTable, “It’s a little countercultural to have a   meal these days. ” OneTable encourages hosts to create a theme for their dinners, which have been organized to support   races or to give socks to the homeless. (There was even a Fashion Week Sabbath.) “Millennials don’t like to gamble with social experiences,” said Ms. Kline, who is in her 40s. “The more they know what to expect, the more people will show up. ” After sifting through OneTable’s inspirational Pinterest boards, I settled on a Mediterranean theme. My dinner was posted, and when it closed for   no strangers had registered. (I couldn’t help noticing a   Sabbath dinner seemed to fill up quickly.) To ensure Andrew and I wouldn’t be eating alone, I had invited two friends  —   a couple, Reid and Danielle  —   and they invited two friends, Aaron and Tamar, neither of whom we knew or knew each other. In other words, not unlike a traditional dinner party. The day before the dinner, I took advantage of one of OneTable’s 56 Sabbath coaches, a mix of Jewish professionals who can offer advice on rituals and hosting. I needed less of a tutorial about the Jewish customs and more about how to impose some structure to the meal and the conversation. After all, my friend Reid pointed out a pitfall to socializing lately: “All we do when we get together is talk about the election and our favorite TV shows. ” Sarah Krinsky, a   rabbinical school student at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan and a OneTable coach, suggested I ask all the guests to talk about a question they’d been wrestling with over the last week or month. “I think that can get at some of the things we don’t usually talk about,” Ms. Krinsky said. I also wanted to steer the conversation, as much as possible, away from the election, which, at that point, was less than a week before. I’d reached my capacity for political conversations for the year, and was convinced after reading the entire internet that week that no one had anything new to say on the topic. (Little did I know.) Before our guests arrived, Andrew, who barely ever takes Advil, asked me if I had a Xanax. The combination of a trip to Moldova the next day and the stakes of Nov. 8 were about to put him over the edge. I briefly considered canceling the dinner. “Who would want to be around such anxious downers?” I thought. I looked at my glaring overhead light and wondered how long it would take someone to lodge a complaint. We would have just been better being miserable alone. But then the guests came. No one asked why I didn’t make salmon, as promised, no one left early or criticized the lighting or talked incessantly about New York City preschool admissions. Instead, we lit the Sabbath candles. We talked about our work, the world, what we were grappling with both personally and professionally. I couldn’t believe how much I was enjoying myself. It was  —   and I found this shocking because socializing is usually stressful for me  —   an exhale moment. Andrew forgot about wanting a Xanax. He said being with other people soothed him. I remembered why civilizations form bonds beyond their families and enjoy others’ company. When a group of people connects, with just enough wine, there’s a release. It’s the feeling that you could sit at the table for hours and not want to check your iPhone. It sounds simple, but it felt like nothing short of a miracle. Now I just have to work up the courage to invite them back.",0

20429,20429,Angst Simmers in Washington as Trump Presidency Nears - The New York Times,Sheryl Gay Stolberg,"WASHINGTON  —   In the Virginia suburb of McLean, where the local diner is a C. I. A. breakfast hangout, Gen. Michael V. Hayden, who ran the agency for George W. Bush, is playing career counselor these days. With   Donald J. Trump attacking the intelligence community, the general says his “old tribe’’ is feeling “a special angst. ” In   Takoma Park, Md. a “  zone” since 1983, a   resistance movement is taking shape. Nadine Bloch, an activist and artist, is running   training on nonviolent protest  —   complete with mock police officers wielding rolled up newspapers as batons. And here in the District of Columbia, where 91 percent of voters cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton, “  panic” is setting in, said John Feehery, a Republican strategist and Trump enthusiast. Leslie Harris, a liberal Democratic lawyer, uses war imagery: “I feel like my city is about to be invaded. ” Washington has always been a chameleon of a city, accustomed to remaking itself when the White House changes hands. But as Mr. Trump’s inaugural draws near, in a nation so deeply divided that it seems the political middle has entirely disappeared, perhaps no place in America feels as unsteady and on edge as the capital, which Mr. Trump calls “the swamp. ” With his 6 a. m. Twitter blasts and   style  —   and a roster of conservative Cabinet picks eager to do an   on President Obama’s policies  —   Mr. Trump has upended the city’s rhythms and jangled its nerves. The White House press corps is fighting to keep its work space in the West Wing.   lobbyists worry their clients will turn up in his Twitter feed. Civil servants, many of them working class, say he knows nothing about running a bureaucracy. “We don’t know exactly what to expect from Trump, except that he’s combative,” said Robert Dallek, a presidential biographer, who has lived here for 20 years. And furthermore, Mr. Dallek complained, “It’s offensive to be called a swamp. ” At their core, Washington and its   suburbs are company towns, populated by people who live and breathe policy and politics, or work in the sprawling federal bureaucracy. The region is “one of the largest and wealthiest economies in the world,” the Brookings Institution recently reported  —   one reason much of America, which suffered greatly during the recession, resents those in the capital. But like the rest of America, Washington is also a real place, with real people, who have lived here for decades. The permanent occupants of “the swamp” see presidents come, and see them go. And no matter what their politics, people agree with Mr. Feehery that this transition “feels different” from any in recent memory. Ms. Harris is an archetypical northwest Washingtonian. A   policy wonk, she grew up somewhere else, Atlanta, and got a taste of politics as a student. When Jimmy Carter won the presidency, she was in the unusual position of being 26 and knowing a lot of powerful people here. She attended law school at Georgetown, married a doctor and raised a daughter and a son. Now semiretired, she used to run the Center for Democracy and Technology, which advocates internet freedom. She has often worked with Republicans they are her friends. But when Mr. Trump was elected, suddenly America’s divisions hit home. When Mike Pence, the vice   rented a house nearby, his neighbors decorated their homes with gay pride rainbow flags. When a white supremacist group hosted a dinner at a nearby Italian restaurant, Maggiano’s, protests erupted outside. Then Comet Ping Pong, a pizzeria where Ms. Harris takes her grandchildren, was targeted by a fake news story involving Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Harris, savvy about the media, organized community support. Soon after, a gunman turned up at the restaurant and fired shots inside. “It was beyond my imagination,” she said. Just over the Maryland line, Takoma Park is a “sanctuary city,” which refuses to prosecute undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump does not look kindly on that. Days after the election, Ms. Bloch, 55, the organizer, helped pull together Takoma Park Mobilization, a new   group aimed at “standing up for our neighbors,” she said. More than 500 people attended the first meeting. They have since divided themselves into committees and subcommittees, with titles like “Immigration” and “Women” and “Civil Rights,” and have been holding weeknight meetings in the firehouse and the airy historical society headquarters, next door to Bikram Yoga and down the street from the food  . Next up: sessions aimed at liberal civil servants agonizing about whether to quit their jobs. “It may be better for us for people to stay,” Ms. Bloch said, “and figure out how to resist within the system. ” In northeast Washington, a heavily   quadrant of the city, such discussions seemed ludicrous people there don’t plan to protest. They just want to stay out of harm’s way. On a snowy Saturday morning at Perfection Unisex Salon, the stylist Chante Watts, 37, urged some of her clients, who are teachers, to come in for cuts on Inauguration Day. They all intend to stay home. She was running a hot comb through the hair of Chris Vera, who helped explain why. Ms. Vera, 32 and a city employee, has been asked to help with the inaugural she fears violence will erupt that day. “Nobody wants to be within a   radius,” she said. “Nobody’s feeling quite safe. ” Yet in the Virginia suburb of Fredericksburg, about an hour’s drive from here and home to many military people and religious conservatives, Tina Whittington, vice president of an   group, has noticed a pickup in home building. “I think there is huge anticipation that this transition is going to be good for our community,” she said, though she confessed that even there, in the heart of Trump country, the feeling is “still a little apprehensive, wait and see. ” In transitions past, Washington has filled with talk of Georgetown parties and the first lady’s ball gown, and how the city’s culture might change. When President Carter left, the capital traded a Georgia peanut farmer and   nuclear engineer for an actor turned politician from California, Ronald Reagan. Bill Clinton brought a touch of Arkansas. George W. Bush ushered in Texas swagger and cowboy boots, and made McLean, where General Hayden lives, the hot neighborhood for that era’s Republican elite. The Obamas honored Stevie Wonder at the White House, and brought in   art and culture. They made the city, where blacks now account for 49 percent of the population  —   down from 60 percent in 2000, a decline that reflects gentrification  —   their own. In black neighborhoods, Michelle Obama will be missed, perhaps more than her husband. (They are not going far. They have rented a lavish home in Kalorama, an exclusive section of the city where Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, will also live.) But with his wife, Melania, and son Barron keeping their primary residence at Trump Tower at least until the school year is out, Mr. Trump may not be spending much time here. That is fine with Mark Salter, a former aide to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who is Mr. Trump’s nemesis on Capitol Hill. “The less he’s here the better, as far as I’m concerned,” Mr. Salter said. Movement conservatives, though, are ecstatic. After eight years in the policy wilderness, scholars at the Heritage Foundation, a policy organization, are helping guide the new Trump administration on ideas and personnel. “Folks were pretty happy,” said Wesley Denton, the Heritage spokesman, when Mr. Trump gave them a   during his recent news conference. But in Democratic policy circles there is little lightness this time around. Neera Tanden, a former adviser and strong ally of Mrs. Clinton, has little patience for questions about the city’s mood. She now leads the Center for American Progress, a leading progressive think tank, a job that makes her a de facto leader of the Democratic resistance. “He’s going to deport undocumented people,” she wrote in an email. “How Washington responds is low on the totem pole of problems with this administration. ” The unease runs especially deep among those General Hayden calls “Republican internationalists,” who advocate engagement with other nations but possess a hawkish suspicion of Russian and Chinese intentions. Having described Mr. Trump as Russia’s “useful fool” on the opinion page of The Washington Post, the general, 71, would never be offered a job. But with Mr. Trump openly questioning the “high confidence judgment” by the C. I. A. about Russian hacking, he has been entertaining a steady stream of visitors wary of joining the new administration. “I say, ‘Yeah, by all means, if the   asks you to serve, consider it seriously,’ ’’ he said. “But don’t think of it as a lifetime commitment you remain a free agent. ’’ If there is a historical parallel to this moment, it may be to President Reagan, said Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former Reagan chief of staff. He recalled how liberal Reagan critics sniffed, “How do you trust this actor with his finger on the nuclear trigger?” conveniently forgetting he had been a   governor of California. (Mr. Trump, by contrast, has never held public office.) And if the denizens of the swamp appear to be in some kind of defensive crouch, Mr. Duberstein says, there is perhaps good reason for that: “Donald is saying there’s a new sheriff in town. ”",0

According to Misao Dean, Professor of English at the University of Victoria, the canoe can be a symbol of colonialism, imperialism and genocide due to history. She also accused the canoers of cultural appropriation because they are primarily white men and have a privileged place in society.

20432,20432,"With Dogs, It’s What You Say — and How You Say It - The New York Times",James Gorman,"Who’s a good dog? Well, that depends on whom you’re asking, of course. But new research suggests that the next time you look at your pup, whether Maltese or mastiff, you might want to choose your words carefully. “Both what we say and how we say it matters to dogs,” said Attila Andics, a research fellow at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest. Dr. Andics, who studies language and behavior in dogs and humans, along with Adam Miklosi and several other colleagues, reported in a paper to be published in this week’s issue of the journal Science that different parts of dogs’ brains respond to the meaning of a word, and to how the word is said, much as human brains do. As with people’s brains, parts of dogs’ left hemisphere react to meaning and parts of the right hemisphere to intonation  —   the emotional content of a sound. And, perhaps most interesting to dog owners, only a word of praise said in a positive tone really made the reward system of a dog’s brain light up. The experiment itself was something of an achievement. Dr. Andics and his colleagues trained dogs to enter a magnetic resonance imaging machine and lie in a harness while the machine recorded their brain activity. A trainer spoke words in Hungarian  —   common words of praise used by dog owners like “good boy,” “super” and “well done. ” The trainer also tried neutral words like “however” and “nevertheless. ” Both the praise words and neutral words were offered in positive and neutral tones. The positive words spoken in a positive tone prompted strong activity in the brain’s reward centers. All the other conditions resulted in significantly less action, and all at the same level. In other words, “good boy” said in a neutral tone and “however” said in a positive or neutral tone all got the same response. What does it all mean? For dog owners, Dr. Andics said, the findings mean that the dogs are paying attention to meaning, and that you should, too. That doesn’t mean a dog won’t wag its tail and look happy when you say, “You stinky mess” in a happy voice. But the dog is looking at your body language and your eyes, and perhaps starting to infer that “stinky mess” is a word of praise. In terms of evolution of language, the results suggest that the capacity to process meaning and emotion in different parts of the brain and tie them together is not uniquely human. This ability had already evolved in   long before humans began to talk. Brian Hare, an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University who was not involved in the study, said he thought the experiment was well done and suggested that specialization of right and left hemispheres in processing information began to evolve well before human language. But, he said, it was still possible that dogs had independently evolved a similar brain organization. Dr. Hare, who studies both dogs and primates, and specializes in cognitive neuroscience and evolution, also pointed out that the dogs could leave the experiment at any time. He wrote in an email, “They were volunteers as much as is possible with animals. ” Primates, he said, cannot be trained to undergo MRI scans willingly.",0
20433,20433,"Chelsea Manning to Remain on Active Duty, Receive Free Health Care after Release - Breitbart",Ben Kew,"Chelsea Manning, the former U. S. soldier who leaked thousands of classified military documents to WikiLeaks, will receive free health care and remain on active duty after being released from prison. [Manning will be freed on May 19th and remain on active duty as well as continue to receive health care benefits conferred to members of the military and access to commissaries, army spokesperson Dave Foster confirmed.  “Pvt. Manning is statutorily entitled to medical care while on excess leave in an active duty status, pending final appellate review,” Foster said. In 2013, Manning was sentenced to 35 years in jail for leaking over 700, 000 classified documents, the biggest leak in U. S. military history. Manning was found guilty of 20 counts, six of them under the Espionage Act, but was acquitted of the most serious charge of “aiding the enemy. ” Much of the content of the leaks, published through Julian Assange of WikiLeaks proved explosive, including a video of an Iraqi airstrike the organization titled “Collateral Murder,” summary executions by U.

20435,20435,Assange Claims ‘Crazed’ Clinton Campaign Tried to Hack WikiLeaks,The Free Thought Project,"Home / Be The Change / Government Corruption / Assange Claims ‘Crazed’ Clinton Campaign Tried to Hack WikiLeaks Assange Claims ‘Crazed’ Clinton Campaign Tried to Hack WikiLeaks The Free Thought Project October 28, 2016 Leave a comment 
(RT) — Julian Assange has claimed the Hillary Clinton campaign has attacked the servers being used by WikiLeaks. Despite the Ecuadorian embassy shutting down his internet until the US election is over, the website will continue publishing, according to Assange. 
“Everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict,” Assange said via telephone at a conference in Argentina on Wednesday. 
The whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from Clinton’s campaign chair, John Podesta, on a daily basis since early October. 
Assange claimed the release “whipped up a crazed hornet’s nest atmosphere in the Hillary Clinton campaign” leading them to attack WikiLeaks. 
“ They attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the UN and British courts to accuse me of being both a Russian spy and a pedophile,” he added. 
Ecuador’s decision to shut down his internet was described by Assange as a “strategic position” so that its “policy of non-intervention can’t be misinterpreted by actors in the US and even domestically in Ecuador.” 
He said he was sympathetic with Ecuador, insisting they face the dilemma of having the US interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the US elections next month.

— RT (@RT_com) October 17, 2016 
Assange, who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference, said he did not agree with Ecuador’s decision but did understand it. WikiLeaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from Ecuador, he said. 
He did, however, reject the idea that WikiLeaks is interfering with the US election, claiming, “this is not the interference of electoral process, this is the definition of electoral process – for media organizations and, in fact, everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring. It cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform.” 
He also attacked US TV networks, many of whom he accused of being “controlled by Clinton supporters.” We were fastest on #Podestaemails6 , faster than @wikileaks , and the US conspiracy machine can’t handle it https://t.co/njAae50qDd 
— RT (@RT_com) October 13, 2016 
The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. “I don’t think there’s any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton,” he said. 
Assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view Trump as representing “what in their mind is white trash.” Share Social Trending",1
20436,20436,"Alissa Rubin, 2016 Pulitzer Winner, Reports From the Front Lines - The New York Times",Mike McPhate,"A foreign correspondent for about 15 years, Alissa Rubin is known for descending deep into some of the world’s scariest conflicts and returning with rare, often poignant glimpses into the plights of soldiers, survivors and victims. On Monday, the Pulitzer Prize board gave Ms. Rubin its international reporting award for her 2015 work in Afghanistan, where it said “she delivered deeply reported, moving articles about the struggle to improve the lives of women. ” Since joining The Los Angeles Times in 1997, Ms. Rubin has spent much of her career covering Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans. After assignments for the newspaper in Iraq and France, she was hired by The New York Times in 2007 as a correspondent in the Baghdad bureau, where she went on to serve as its chief. In 2009, she became chief of The Times’s bureau in Kabul, Afghanistan. The work was sometimes harrowing. In August 2014, Ms. Rubin was in a helicopter that crashed while delivering aid to Yazidi refugees in Iraqi Kurdistan. She suffered severely broken wrists and a fractured skull. Later, as she narrated the experience from a hospital bed in Baghdad, her concerns focused on the refugees and the pilot. Over her career, Ms. Rubin has earned recognition from the industry as a reporter of unique courage and fierce intellect. She has picked up a number of awards, among them the 2015 John Chancellor Award, which honors lifetime achievement in journalism. A Pulitzer was not the only recognition she received on Monday. Earlier in the day, Atlantic Media announced that it was bestowing its 2016 Michael Kelly Award on Ms. Rubin for her series of articles on women in Afghanistan. A news release said she risked her life to capture the struggles of the women “in illuminating and sensitive detail. ” Earlier in her career, Ms. Rubin worked at The Congressional Quarterly, The Wichita Eagle and The American Lawyer magazine. She is a graduate of Brown University and earned a master’s degree in history from Columbia University. Ms. Rubin now serves as The Times’s bureau chief in Paris. Below are some highlights from Ms. Rubin’s work.

20437,20437,David Frum: Hillary is a Patriot Who Will Protect the Constitution,Daniel Greenfield,"David Frum: Hillary is a Patriot Who Will Protect the Constitution November 3, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
If David Frum had suggested that Hillary Clinton used to play for the Patriots, I would have found his argument a little more credible than claiming that she is a patriot. 
But she is a patriot. She will uphold the sovereignty and independence of the United States. She will defend allies. She will execute the laws with reasonable impartiality. She may bend some rules for her own and her supporters’ advantage. She will not outright defy legality altogether. Above all, she can govern herself; the first indispensable qualification for governing others. 
This is under an Atlantic piece headlined, ""The Conservative Case for Hillary"" which also contends, ""Why support a candidate who rejects your preferences and offends your opinions? Don’t do it for her—do it for the republic, and the Constitution."" 
The trouble with this line of argument is that Hillary's own agenda includes a rejection of the First and Second Amendment. It's a rather unusual way to support the Constitution by destroying it. 
Then there's the whole Hillary is a quarterback for the New England Patriots business. Who has ever accused Hillary Clinton of being a patriot? How was this patriotism manifested? In Benghazi? In Iran? In Russia? I'll skip over the ""outright defy legality altogether"" argument. Though it's certainly sad that this is now considered some sort of high water mark. 
But can Hillary govern herself? Is the compulsive liar who can't help shouting, ""I was in New York on 9/11"" really capable of governing herself? 
""I am voting to defend Americans' profoundest shared commitment: a commitment to norms and rules that today protect my rights under a president I don’t favor, and that will tomorrow do the same service for you"".

Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but denied that his newly revealed contacts with a Russian official were related to the presidential campaign. Democratic leaders called on Mr. Sessions to resign. Republicans confronted a widening split in their ranks over how to proceed amid a growing uproar over questions about the Trump team’s ties to Russia, even as they mostly resisted calls for a special prosecutor or select committee. The White House disclosed that Michael Flynn, the national security adviser, and Jared Kushner, the president’s    and senior adviser, also met with the Russian ambassador in December. As we reported, the outgoing Obama administration scrambled to preserve intelligence about the campaign’s possible contacts with Russia by spreading it across the government. _____ 2. On Capitol Hill, Ben Carson, the    was confirmed as secretary of housing and urban development. And Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, got final approval to lead the Energy Department, a role that puts him in charge of the country’s nuclear arsenal. Another administration official, the new secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke of Montana, arrived at his new office on horseback. _____ 3. Republican lawmakers in at least 16 states are trying to rein in protests with bills to make them more orderly or to toughen penalties when they go awry. Some of the bills are backed by the president’s supporters, and some appear to be responses to demonstrations against him and his policies. One activist called the proposals “intimidation from the right. ” _____ 4. Shares of Snap Inc. valued at $24 billion in its public offering, jumped 41 percent in the company’s first day of trading. That’s a powerful showing for Snap’s   messaging service, Snapchat. Wall Street has been on an upward trajectory since Election Day. Our columnist looks at what the booming markets mean for the global economy. _____ 5. Syrian government forces again drove Islamic State militants out of Palmyra, the ancient city that was prewar Syria’s leading tourist attraction. The Islamic State had used the city as a propaganda windfall, making a sport out of pilfering and vandalizing prized antiquities it considered heretical, and using the Roman theater for public beheadings. _____ 6. A year after the European Union closed its borders to asylum seekers, tens of thousands of refugees languish in camps in Greece, many of them children. Their lives in limbo have taken on an air of permanence. “Everyone here feels depressed,” said a young Afghan. _____ 7. China has at least 10 White Houses, four Arcs de Triomphe, a couple of Great Sphinxes and at least one Eiffel Tower. But a replica of London’s Tower Bridge, celebrated as “even more magnificent” than the original, has set off a debate over whether these buildings  —   created as publicity stunts and popular as photo backdrops  —   are actually denigrating Chinese culture. _____ 8. A few prominent artists are working to preserve the   house where Nina Simone was born, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. A previous owner had invested in period 1930s details, hoping to make it into a museum for the legendary singer and civil rights icon, who died in 2003 at age 70. But the project languished. “She formed a lot of who I am and my sense of history,” said one of the artists. “And I think of the town as a portal to a woman who influenced so many. ” _____ 9.

20439,20439,Trump Links C.I.A. Reports on Russia to Democrats’ Shame Over Election - The New York Times,Nicholas Fandos,"WASHINGTON  —     Donald J. Trump said in an interview broadcast on Sunday that he did not believe American intelligence assessments that Russia had intervened to help his candidacy, casting blame for the reports on Democrats, who he said were embarrassed about losing to him. “I think it’s ridiculous. I think it’s just another excuse,” Mr. Trump said in the interview, on “Fox News Sunday. ” “I don’t believe it. ” He also indicated that as president, he would not take the daily intelligence briefing that President Obama and his predecessors have received. Mr. Trump, who has received the briefing sparingly as   said that it was often repetitive and that he would take it “when I need it. ” He said his vice president, Mike Pence, would receive the daily briefing. “You know, I’m, like, a smart person,” he said. “I don’t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years. ” He added that he had instructed the officials who give the briefing: “‘If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I’m available on a  ’s notice. ’” Mr. Trump’s seeming dismissal of the importance of that daily interaction with intelligence agencies, as well as his claims of politically tainted intelligence reports on Russia, widened a breach between a   and the agencies he will have to rely on to carry out priorities like fighting terrorism and deterring cyberattacks. His stance on the issue is also putting him increasingly at odds with senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including members of his own party, who say that the evidence of Russian interference is clear and warrants a congressional investigation. The Obama administration reached a consensus months ago that Russia was trying to meddle in the election. After initially believing that Russia’s goal was to undermine American democratic processes, the intelligence agencies concluded a week after the vote that the Russian efforts had been intended, at least in their latter stages, to help Mr. Trump. The   said those new reports were politically motivated. “I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country,” he said in the interview, recorded on Saturday. During the campaign, he also dismissed suggestions of Russian meddling. Pressed about why he did not believe the intelligence agencies’ conclusions, Mr. Trump said there was disagreement among intelligence agencies about the extent and the origin of the hacking. “They’re fighting among themselves,” he said. “They’re not sure. ” The Washington Post and The New York Times reported on Friday that American intelligence agencies had concluded that Russia took covert action during the campaign to harm the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. The new conclusion, The Times reported, was based in part on evidence found by the C. I. A. that Russian hackers had penetrated the Republican National Committee’s computer system, as well as that of the Democrats and several of Mrs. Clinton’s senior aides, but had leaked only Democratic correspondence. Mr. Trump’s transition office responded to those reports with a statement on Friday night dismissing the intelligence agencies as “the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. ” The office said it was time to “move on” from the election. The Iraq case has been the subject of a   debate over whether the intelligence was tainted or whether the Bush White House read it selectively to support its decision to go to war. On the subject of Russian interference, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said Sunday that it would be dangerous to dismiss the issue as a matter of partisan politics. He urged Mr. Trump to accept the agencies’ conclusions, and called on his colleagues to move forward with an investigation. “You can’t make this issue partisan it’s too important,” Mr. McCain said on the CBS program “Face the Nation. ” “A fundamental of democracy is a free and fair election. ” Referring to the hacking, Mr. McCain added, “The Russians have been using it as a tool as part of Vladimir Putin’s ambition to regain Russian prominence and dominance in some parts of the world. ” Mr. McCain was among a bipartisan group of four senior lawmakers, including the coming minority leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, who issued a statement Sunday pledging to work to respond to the incursions. The statement adds pressure to Republicans, who control Congress, to investigate the hacking. “Democrats and Republicans must work together, and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress, to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks,” the statement said. Several senators, including Rand Paul of Kentucky and James Lankford of Oklahoma, both Republicans, expressed support for such an investigation on Sunday. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, did not comment on the issue over the weekend, but he was expected to address it in a news conference scheduled for Monday morning. Mr. McCain said on “Face the Nation” that he would like to see a select committee formed to look into the C. I. A. ’s conclusions, but that in the meantime, an armed services subcommittee under his control would “go to work on it. ”",0

20441,20441,Bargain-Hunting Frenzy Threatens Traditional Department Stores - The New York Times,Rachel Abrams,"Women’s shoe clearance! We’ve got your size! Save 20 percent! Macy’s has discount fever, and signs like these pepper its sprawling flagship store in Manhattan. But while shoppers love a sale, those discounts are coming at a steep price to Macy’s and the country’s other large department stores. “It’s poison,” said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. “They’ve created no motivation for consumers to respond to their promotions, since if you missed this week’s sale you just need to wait around until next week. ” Or not at all. Shoppers may be addicted to discounts, but not necessarily those at the leading department stores. This week, Macy’s, Nordstrom, Kohl’s and J. C. Penney all reported unexpectedly weak sales, driving their stocks sharply lower. The headwinds facing department stores are coming from several directions, including from online shopping. The companies’ earnings look especially bleak in comparison with the broad retail picture in the United States. On Friday, the government reported that overall retail spending had ticked higher in April. But the results this week reinforced the degree to which companies have failed to adjust to discount retail chains like Ross and the TJX companies, T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, which have spent years developing their niche and are attracting more people. “Consumers like that idea of getting a bargain,” said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst for Conlumino. “That certainly has been unhelpful to the department stores. ”   of course, is nothing new. But the hunt itself has changed. The economic collapse of 2008 forced many Americans to cling tighter to their purse strings, and forced many shoppers to more aggressively hunt for   options. That spurred many consumers toward     retailers like T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and Ross, where many have remained, according to Jharonne Martis, the director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters. “During the recession, they were a favorite among customers,” Ms. Martis said. A decade ago, Mr. Saunders said, there were sharper distinctions between the customers who shopped at Nordstrom and those who picked through the racks at   stores. In 2005, 5. 1 percent of shoppers who regularly used   retailers also shopped at department stores for clothing, he said. Last year, that figure rose to 12. 9 percent. “People that used   and discount channels tended to be a bit more isolated,” Mr. Saunders said. “Now, there’s a lot more customer sharing, and a lot more people who use department stores also use   retailers much more freely. ” The difference between the products offered at the different retailers is also getting blurry. Department stores and discount chains have sold increasingly similar products. Macy’s and Nordstrom may have once been associated with brands like Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren, but those labels now frequently appear in the   aisles as well, Ms. Martis said. That has made department stores less of a destination, she said. Still, department stores are trying to match the demand for discount shopping, slashing prices and combining points in a frenzied attempt to keep up with an increasing variety of   rivals. But they have not done enough to stem the tide of losses. “When you have a significant amount of clearance, you dilute your own brand,” Ms. Martis said. “The department stores were built for a different decade. ” Macy’s and J. C. Penney declined to comment for this article. Nordstrom and Kohl’s could not be reached for comment. Ms. Martis and other retail analysts said that department stores had done a poor job of keeping up with younger consumers. Those shoppers are often   and generally less inclined to shop at the same stores that their parents once did. The promotions might do a good job of targeting people looking for low prices, but the brands sometimes do not. At Macy’s in Herald Square on Thursday, shoppers combed through entire rooms dedicated to discount shoes. But the assortment, however plentiful, may not have been for everyone. “They probably missed out on that whole sneaker thing,” said Jacqui Booker, 38, who had come to Macy’s to look at appliances. “The fact that they don’t sell a Jordan in here is probably keeping every kid away,” Ms. Booker said, referring to Air Jordan, Nike’s popular athletic shoe. On Friday, J. C. Penney reported a loss of 32 cents a share, and said that sales at stores open more than a year had fallen 0. 4 percent.   sales at Macy’s fell 5. 6 percent in the first quarter. Some department stores, like Nordstrom, have been aggressive about opening their own discount chains. But while business improved at Nordstrom’s discount division, Nordstrom Rack,   net sales fell 2. 2 percent. Also on Friday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose 1. 3 percent in April, driven in large part by sales of automobiles and gas, along with online shopping. “The retail sales numbers underscore the shift, underscore the challenges department stores are having,” said Richard Jaffe, a managing director and retail analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. Amazon represents one of those main challenges. The online shopping giant has increasingly pulled consumers away from traditional    stores, and has shown every indication that it intends to grow. But while Amazon accounts for half of all   by some estimates, most shopping in the United States still happens in person. The problems at the larger department stores, Mr. Saunders argued, run deeper. “Amazon plays a big part of this, but it’s not the only part,” Mr. Saunders said. “I think retailers have to take some share of the blame themselves. ” Including, some might say, for their discounts. “I think at this point,” Ms. Booker said, “everyone that knows Macy’s knows that you go on Sale Wednesday. ”",0
20442,20442,"Dallas Gunman Had Plans for Wider Attack, Police Say - The New York Times",Alan Blinder and Timothy Williams,"DALLAS  —   The gunman who killed five police officers in Dallas had enough   materials in his home to lead the authorities to believe he was planning a larger attack, the city’s police chief said on Sunday. He provided new details of how, during two hours of negotiations, the gunman sang, laughed and asked how many officers he had killed before he was killed by a   robot. David O. Brown, the police chief, said evidence showed that Micah Johnson, 25, an   Army Reserve veteran who told the police that he wanted to kill white officers, had been practicing detonations and that the explosive material had the potential “to have devastating effects throughout our city and our North Texas area. ” “We’re convinced this suspect had other plans and thought that what he was doing was righteous,” Chief Brown said on CNN’s “State of the Union. ” Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas, in an interview near the shooting site, described Mr. Johnson as having employed tactics designed to cause as much harm to people as possible. “He was really well trained in becoming a killing machine, O. K.?” he said. “Shooting low, fighting    at that one point, going high, shooting down another street. This guy trained himself not for that exact location, but he knew how to elicit pain on people. ” The details emerged as the nation was immersed in protests, vigils and calls for peace from many pulpits after a week of unsettling violence that began with the fatal police shootings of Alton Sterling, in Baton Rouge, La. and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn. The attack on officers on Thursday night in Dallas turned a peaceful demonstration against the earlier shootings into a scene of bloodshed and chaos. President Obama cut short an overseas trip and planned to travel on Tuesday to Dallas, where he, along with former President George W. Bush, will address a memorial service. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Laura Bush will also attend, the White House said. Mr. Obama, speaking in Spain, urged protesters to avoid inflammatory words and actions, but also defended the right to demonstrate, saying that one of the nation’s great virtues is its openness to protest and efforts to speak truth to power. He said Black Lives Matter had grown out of a long protest tradition that dated to the abolitionist movement. In such movements, Mr. Obama said, “there’s always going to be some folks who say things that are stupid or imprudent, or overgeneralize, or are harsh. ” Demonstrators gathered again on Sunday in cities as scattered as Dallas, Falcon Heights, Memphis, Baton Rouge, Atlanta and New York City, where 300 people marched silently, fists raised in the air, from Times Square to Union Square, with signs proclaiming “Stop police terror!” and “Stand together. ” In Baton Rouge, police officers in riot gear and flanked by SWAT trucks were trying on Sunday evening to turn back protesters who had come from a peaceful rally earlier and were trying to march to the Police Headquarters a few miles away. A Baton Rouge police spokesman said 48 arrests had been made by about 10 p. m. most for obstructing a roadway. No weapons had been confiscated, he said. News outlets in Memphis reported that protesters there had blocked traffic on the Interstate 40 bridge spanning the Mississippi River after a rally downtown. Some activists began circulating text messages asking   around the country to boycott major retailers and to deposit $100 into a   bank as a means of economically stopping the “slaughtering of black lives. ” Hundreds of demonstrators had been arrested Saturday night and into early Sunday in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, St. Paul and Baton Rouge, including DeRay Mckesson, a prominent activist in the Black Lives Matter movement who was released Sunday afternoon. In Phoenix, officers used pepper spray to disperse crowds. In St. Paul and Baton Rouge, the mood had been tense overnight Saturday into Sunday morning. In St. Paul, protesters had shut down an interstate highway for hours. At least 20 officers were injured as people threw rocks, bottles and bricks, the police said. The authorities in Baton Rouge, where Mr. Sterling was fatally shot early Tuesday, said they had arrested more than 100 people, charging most with obstructing the road. Among them were three members of the news media and Mr. Mckesson, who filmed his encounter with the police using the   app Periscope. John Bel Edwards, Louisiana’s governor, said Sunday that the vast majority of protesters had behaved lawfully and that the police response had been moderate. He said some of the disturbances had been caused by demonstrators from outside Louisiana, but pledged that “they will not be allowed to incite hate and violence. ” Pastors across the nation called for reconciliation and compassion. At St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York, Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan spoke of a country “worried, frustrated and fatigued over senseless violence. ” “From Minnesota to Louisiana and Texas, one nation under God examines its soul,” he said. “Sadness and heaviness is especially present in our   and law enforcement communities. ” He added, “We pray with and for them. ” In his television appearance, Chief Brown provided new details of the two hours of negotiations that the police conducted with Mr. Johnson, saying he had demanded to speak to a black negotiator, had sung and laughed, and had asked how many officers he had killed. Mr. Johnson also wrote the letters “R. B. ” in blood on the walls of the parking garage where he had hidden, Chief Brown said, an indication that he may have been wounded. It was not clear what those letters referred to, the chief said. Chief Brown said Mr. Johnson “obviously had some delusion. ” He described the gunman as doing “quite a bit of rambling at the scene. ” The police chief said investigators were examining Mr. Johnson’s laptop, journal and cellphone and had not completely ruled out the possibility that others were involved. He said he believed Mr. Johnson’s aim was to “make us pay for what he sees as law enforcement’s efforts to punish people of color,” including the fatal police shootings of   in Louisiana and Minnesota in the days before the ambush. Those deaths, Chief Brown said, prompted Mr. Johnson to “fast track” plans to kill police officers. Describing the moments that occurred just before Thursday’s shootings, Chief Brown said that once the protesters had started to march through downtown Dallas, Mr. Johnson had driven his vehicle, a black Chevrolet Tahoe, well ahead of the group to prepare for the attack on police officers escorting the demonstrators. “You could easily see the march coming down the street they were walking, and saw an opportunity with some   positions, a couple of buildings in the pathway of the marchers, and decided to take the high ground and start shooting right away,” Chief Brown said. “And we had to scramble to block intersections, which did expose our officers to this attack. And this suspect took advantage of that. And once he was in a   position, officers did not know where the shots was coming from. ” Officials in recent days have revealed that Mr. Johnson, who served in the Army Reserve from 2009 to 2015, had   materials, ballistic vests, rifles, ammunition and a journal of combat tactics in his home. His journal described a method of attack in which a gunman can keep moving to confuse the enemy. The chief and Mr. Rawlings, the Dallas mayor, defended the Police Department’s use of the robot bomb that killed Mr. Johnson. Critics have raised questions about the episode, which may have been the first time a local law enforcement agency in the United States had used such a device to kill a suspect. Chief Brown said that the suspect had hidden in a corner in the garage and that deploying a sniper would have exposed the police to “great danger. ” “We believe that we saved lives by making this decision,” he said. Mr. Rawlings, in the interview Sunday, described Mr. Johnson as having employed tactics designed to cause as much harm to people as possible. The mayor, who heard portions of Mr. Johnson’s discussions with police negotiators, said the gunman was “just talking about how he was just upset with the whole world and upset with police, upset with white police. ” He added, “I believe he was mentally ill. ” Mr. Rawlings added: “I believed he wanted to kill officers. He did it, and a person like that would never be satisfied usually until they were taken down. ” In a separate interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” he said that he supported the department’s use of the bomb, and that the authorities had opted to use it only after negotiators had been unable to persuade Mr. Johnson to surrender. “It was a difficult decision because the safety of our police officers were in our mind,” Mr. Rawlings said. “The chief had two options, and he went with this one. I supported him completely because it was the safest way to approach it, and we talked to this man a long time and he threatened to blow up our police officers. We went to his home, we saw that there was   equipment later, so it was very important that we realize that he may not be bluffing. ” The Dallas Morning News published a   editorial urging the city to emerge as an example of how to bring the nation together. “Today our country seems capable of pulling apart in ways that have not seemed possible in many decades,” the editorial said. “Dallas, again, has been bathed in blood and grief. How we respond will help show a path forward to a divided, reeling nation. ” Chief Brown called for Americans to support police officers, but acknowledged that “we’re not perfect. There’s cops that don’t need to be cops. ” And he had a message for the protesters: “We’re sworn to protect you and your right to protest. And we will give our lives for it. ”",0

""I could've sworn this influx of duplicate emails we've already seen before would present us with some new information."" 
After completing his review of the recently discovered email collection, FBI Director James Comey has stated that no additional evidence to further prosecute Secretary Hillary Clinton has been found. This has come as a shock to many who don't understand history and believed that this time would end differently then every single case before it. 
""I can't believe the FBI would allow such a travesty,"" Trump said in a speech Sunday afternoon, ""I mean we went through all the necessary legal procedures. We grossly over-exaggerated everything and promised indictment without any real evidence or basis for evaluation but didn't get the results we were hoping for. The FBI is rigged, gotta be."" 
The Republican Presidential Candidate didn't stay negative for long though as he then went on to describe his next wildly absurd plan that would no doubt backfire on him.

20444,20444,Bypassing Stigma to Take Care of Herself and Her Daughter - The New York Times,John Otis,"Six years and contrasting personalities separated Diana Olivarez and her younger brother, Xavier. “I’m very intense,” said Ms. Olivarez, 29. “He was just carefree, didn’t take life too seriously. ” Before Xavier was born, Ms. Olivarez lived in Mexico with her grandparents. Her parents had left for the United States with the intention of finding work and making enough money to eventually return to Mexico and build a house. But once Xavier was born in the United States, the plan changed: Her parents decided to make a life in the Bronx and Ms. Olivarez joined them when she was 6. But she had difficulty adjusting. Her first winter in New York was brutally cold and dark. While her parents worked long hours, she and Xavier were handed off to babysitters. The language barrier was another hurdle. Classmates who spoke Spanish used an unfamiliar dialect, and learning English was difficult because she could not practice it with family members at home. “I became really withdrawn because I couldn’t communicate,” Ms. Olivarez said. In time, she not only taught herself English, but also started to excel in school. She received a scholarship in 2005 to attend Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N. Y. but she could not control her erratic behavior. “I was starting to get in trouble in school and I remember just having a lot of energy where I just couldn’t stop doing things,” Ms. Olivarez said. Her parents observed the behavior but did not address it, she said. Xavier rarely reacted to her outbursts, which only infuriated her, she said. At Marist, Ms. Olivarez learned the cause of her oscillating moods: She was told she had a bipolar disorder. “It costs you a lot of relationships, a lot of money and a lot of time,” she said. “People kind of stay away from you, think you’re trouble. ” Ms. Olivarez said she felt the stigma that society attached to mental illness, and it drove her into denial. She told herself that the problems were not severe, that the disorder was not what led her to drop out of Marist. Ms. Olivarez returned to school in 2011, enrolling at Fordham University’s School of Continuing and Professional Studies, majoring in philosophy and Spanish. In 2013, she married her longtime boyfriend. When she told Xavier about their engagement, he started to cry, a rare moment of affection between the siblings. “He said he felt like he was losing his sister and I said, ‘You aren’t losing me, I’m always going to be there for you,’” Ms. Olivarez recalled. She gave birth to a girl, Jade, in 2014, and made the choice to address her mental illness decided that she could not responsibly raise her daughter while she struggled with an untreated illness. She now takes medication. “It’s very serious if you don’t get the help that you need,” Ms. Olivarez said. “It can kill you. ” In March, Ms. Olivarez gave birth to a second daughter, Ruby. Both of her children are enrolled in early childhood programs with the Children’s Aid Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Jade was placed in an early intervention program after Ms. Olivarez said she observed developmental issues. Ms. Olivarez saw in Jade her own struggles growing up and she knew she had to act, unlike her parents. “I think they just did the best they could,” she said of her parents. “But I look at my daughter and how can I see her going through this and not get her help? You just really need to be aware. ” Ms. Olivarez has since postponed her academic ambitions in order to focus on Jade’s needs. But just as Ms. Olivarez was making strides in her life  —   with her children, her mental illness and her relationship with her brother  —   she was dealt a dramatic setback. Xavier got into an argument with a man on a street corner on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in April and was fatally stabbed. The police arrested a    man, who was charged with murder. The family decided to bury Xavier, who was 22, in Mexico, where Ms. Olivarez’s parents hope to return after they retire in the next few years. “The decision was made to take him there, so they can have him there,” Ms. Olivarez said. The Children’s Aid Society used $1, 000 in Neediest Funds to cover some of the burial costs. Ms. Olivarez, her husband and children live with her parents in the Bronx. They all grieved for Xavier together, which she said helped them connect in ways they had not before. Ms. Olivarez’s mother now helps care for her grandchildren, and has become more attuned to her daughter’s struggles. Ms. Olivarez said her mother now notices when she is under stress and tries to put her at ease. “I still have my ups and my downs but they’re not as intense as they were before,” she said. Ms. Olivarez hopes that by being open about her own challenges, people might become empathetic to others suffering with mental illnesses. She wants everyone to shed the unreasonable fears and misconceptions. “It is so different when you get help,” Ms. Olivarez said. “I think that a lot of people stay in a state of shame,” she added. “They don’t reach out because there is a lot of shame, but life is so much better. ”",0

This house in Bellmore!!! 
Posted by Brian Mc Kibbin on Thursday, October 20, 2016 
The video of the house, posted on Facebook by Brian McKibbin, has gone viral, garnering over 2.5 million views in less than a week. Advertisement - story continues below 
The house was decorated with signs calling Clinton a “traitor,”“liar” and “murderer.” The house also featured several large displays encouraging people to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump. 
It was unclear whether the person behind the decorations decided to do this for Halloween or just because he really doesn’t like Clinton . In any case, it really is an awesome display that works perfectly for both Halloween and the upcoming election. 
While this house might be scary, the real nightmare would be Clinton actually being elected. That’s why you need to get out and vote. If your state has early voting, go vote right away. 
We can laugh about this house’s anti-Hillary display all we want, but if she wins on Nov. 8, we won’t be laughing anymore. Advertisement - story continues below",1
20446,20446,The View From Syria as a Cease-Fire Takes Effect - The New York Times,Anne Barnard and Hwaida Saad,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   The timing of the   in Syria, which took effect on Monday at sundown and was largely holding on Tuesday, is fraught with symbolism. It coincides with Eid   the Muslim Feast of the Sacrifice, which commemorates Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son for God. The tale is central to the Muslim, Christian and Jewish faiths  —   and a recurring literary metaphor for society’s sacrifice of the young in the wars of their elders. United Nations agencies and other aid groups have scrambled to prepare   aid deliveries to the divided city of Aleppo. But on Tuesday they were still awaiting official word that the route was secure. We are tracking the experiences and observations of people in many parts of Syria as the truce changes, or fails to change, their lives. Read more about the terms of the deal here. Samsam, 26, is an aid worker in the   western part of Aleppo, which was once Syria’s largest city. She asked to be identified by only a nickname  —   it means “sesame” in Arabic  —   because she was not authorized by the government to speak to foreign reporters. She said in a telephone interview from Aleppo, which is divided between the government in the west and the rebels in the east, that residents found   frightening. When the truces inevitably break down, she said, violence escalates, and the halt in fighting also interrupts war’s predictable routine. Dr. Omar Abu Mariam, 30, a neurosurgeon, asked to be identified by only his first name and a nickname, for the safety of his family. He is the only neurosurgeon working in the   part of eastern Aleppo, where many patients with brain injuries die because doctors lack equipment and the evacuation route to Turkey has lately been cut off by shelling. He often operates around the clock and does not expect the   deal to change that, he said in a text message. For Eid, he went to a friend’s house for dinner. His friend had managed to find a sheep to slaughter, though it was more difficult and expensive to come by than usual, and they ate sheep’s liver and   baklava, traditional Eid sweets. On the way back, the city was almost pitch black. “The streets were empty. Dark,” he said. “No fuel for cars. Few generators. ” The first evening of the truce passed without a call to the emergency room. But when he got home, he could hear explosions in the distance.    missiles, he speculated. The doctor wondered if he would make it through another day without heading back to the operating room. “The   is a big lie,” he said. Ibrahim Abo Allith, one of the volunteer rescue workers with the White Helmets, also known as the Syria Civil Defense, recounted a tense prelude to the planned   in Aleppo. According to unconfirmed reports from Mr. Allith and other activists on the ground, there were barrel bomb attacks on Monday in the neighborhood of   in   eastern Aleppo. Dani Qappani, 28, graduated from Damascus University with a degree in English literature in 2011, the first year of the revolt against President Bashar  ’s government. Mr. Qappani became an antigovernment media activist in Moadhamiyeh, a suburb less than two miles from downtown Damascus, the Syrian capital. He uses a pseudonym for his safety to post videos. Mr. Qappani writes poems and notes about politics on Facebook. He is worried about divisions in the Moahdhamiyeh, between those who want to accept reconciliation with the government and others, like him, who do not. Here’s how he described the situation in an online chat: “It’s a bit better today,” he said on Tuesday in a text message. “I can hear music being played in the Eid square. ” Khaled Khalifa, 52, is an author well known for his novel “In Praise of Hatred,” about the Muslim Brotherhood uprising in 1982 and the government’s crackdown. In the dark hours of Monday morning, he posted on his public Facebook page about his plans for Eid in Damascus. He chatted online about his plans for Eid with the Beirut bureau of The New York Times a short while later: Elham, 32, has two children and is married to a government employee. She woke up to quiet on Tuesday in Damascus, instead of outgoing blasts from a nearby army position. She spoke to a Times reporter, who is identifying her by her first name only for her safety. Muhammed Najdat Kaddour, 31, went to Binnish, in   territory in Idlib Province, to film the aftermath of an airstrike over the weekend and to interview survivors. In a phone interview on Monday, he described a local Eid celebration (he sent photos, below) and his own pessimism about the   and his distrust of President Assad and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia: Bashar   29, taught in a government elementary school in a village north of Raqqa until the Islamic State took over and made the city the de facto capital of its   caliphate. Now he stays home except to shop for groceries. He spoke in a call over the internet.",0
20447,20447,Mistrial for South Carolina Officer Who Shot Walter Scott - The New York Times,Alan Blinder,"CHARLESTON, S. C.  —   The trial of Michael T. Slager, the police officer whose videotaped killing of an unarmed black man staggered a nation already embroiled in a debate about police misconduct and racial bias in law enforcement, ended in a mistrial on Monday. Judge Clifton B. Newman’s decision to halt the proceedings came three days after jurors signaled that they were within one vote of returning a guilty verdict against Mr. Slager, who could have been convicted of murder or voluntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Walter L. Scott. But on Monday, in a final note to Judge Newman, jurors said that “despite the best efforts of all members, we are unable to come to a unanimous decision. ” The outcome was disappointingly familiar to critics of police practices and conduct, and demonstrated the steep hurdles associated with prosecuting a police officer for a shooting while on duty. Although other cases involving claims of police misconduct have ended in mistrials and acquittals, few resonated as widely as this case in North Charleston, where Mr. Slager fired eight shots as Mr. Scott ran away. “The fight isn’t over, that was Round 1,” said L. Chris Stewart, a lawyer for Mr. Scott’s family. “We all saw what he did. We all saw what happened. ” In a statement, Gov. Nikki R. Haley said: “Justice is not always immediate, but we must all have faith that it will be served  —   I certainly do. ” Prosecutors said they would seek a new trial for Mr. Slager, who was fired after the shooting, and the Scott family expressed confidence that he would ultimately be convicted. Mr. Slager’s lawyer, Andrew J. Savage III, did not comment as he left the courtroom, where jurors had heard testimony for about four weeks. No piece of evidence was more central than a cellphone video, which a   Feidin Santana, recorded as he walked to work on April 4, 2015. The video began only after Mr. Scott fled on foot from a traffic stop for a broken taillight, but it was shocking and vivid. In the recording, the men engage in a struggle, and then, as Mr. Scott runs away, Mr. Slager raises his Glock handgun and fires. Mr. Scott falls to the ground. He was at least 17 feet away when Mr. Slager began to shoot. It was a sequence that jurors saw over and over, and the sound of the gunshots repeatedly pierced the courtroom. On Monday, the existence of the video, and its inability to lead to a conviction, fueled much of the furor and frustration about the trial’s resolution, incomplete as it was. “It saddens me, but I am not shocked,” said Howard Friedman, a civil rights lawyer and the former president of the National Police Accountability Project. “The fact that out of 12 people you would find one person so prejudiced in favor of police is saddening, not shocking, because I know that kind of prejudice in favor of police is out there. ” In Missouri, where an August 2014 police killing in Ferguson spurred both peaceful protests and unrest, State Senator Maria   said the outcome in Charleston had left her “hopeless. ” “When you have the video that shows that Walter Scott is running away and still you have a mistrial?” Ms.   said. Here in Charleston County, investigators at first believed Mr. Slager when he said he had been attacked. But Mr. Santana’s video, which emerged within days of the shooting and provoked international outrage, made Mr. Slager a pariah to many in law enforcement, an anomaly of policing who strayed far from his duties and oath when he opened fire and, prosecutors contended, tried to stage the scene to make the shooting appear justified. “Our whole criminal justice system rides on the back of law enforcement,” the chief prosecutor for Charleston County, Scarlett A. Wilson, said during her closing argument. “They have to be held accountable when they mess up. It is very, very rare, but it does happen. ” Ms. Wilson acknowledged from the beginning of the trial that she thought Mr. Scott had contributed to his own death by running away. “If Walter Scott had stayed in that car, he wouldn’t have been shot,” Ms. Wilson said. “He paid the extreme consequence for his conduct. He lost his life for his foolishness. ” Ms. Wilson’s concession, which she made during her opening statement, was something of an effort to immunize the prosecution from a theory that the defense advanced throughout the trial: that Mr. Scott had acted in ways that made Mr. Slager fear for his life. In his closing argument, Mr. Savage said Mr. Scott had left the officer with little choice after he “made decisions to attack a police officer. ” “Should he have assumed that an unarmed man would have attacked a police officer?” Mr. Savage said of Mr. Slager, who he complained had been made a “poster boy” of police misconduct claims because of disputed killings elsewhere in the country. Mr. Slager pressed a similar argument when he testified that he had felt “total fear” and “fired until the threat was stopped, like I’m trained to do. ” The jury here had three options, besides deadlocking: a conviction for murder, a conviction for voluntary manslaughter or an acquittal. In South Carolina, a murder conviction can lead to a life sentence, and manslaughter carries a term of two to 30 years. Mr. Slager’s case and its outcome were virtually certain to revive the storm that surrounded North Charleston, a city of about 108, 000 people, after Mr. Scott’s death. City officials, who agreed to a $6. 5 million settlement with Mr. Scott’s family, have long insisted that Mr. Slager was an outlier. But critics argued last year and again on Monday that the shooting was a tragic result of an aggressive law enforcement strategy carried out by a largely white police force. Drivers and pedestrians faced frequent stops for minor violations, and the police increased their presence, especially in   areas that happened to be predominantly black neighborhoods. The approach, community leaders said, eroded trust, and North Charleston’s Police Department is now the subject of a Justice Department review as part of a “collaborative reform process. ” Another arm of the Justice Department is involved in a different legal battle against Mr. Slager, who has been accused in a federal indictment of violating Mr. Scott’s civil rights. But Mr. Slager will now also face a second trial in state court, and lawyers will undoubtedly consider the feedback that emerged from a jury that appeared bitterly divided during deliberations, which began on Wednesday. In a letter to Judge Newman on Friday, a single juror said he could not “in good conscience consider a guilty verdict. ” The jury’s foreman, the panel’s only black member, said in a separate note that the group was mostly in agreement that Mr. Slager should be convicted: “It’s just one juror that has the issues. ” The foreman also said: “That juror needs to leave. He is having issues. ” But on Monday morning, the jury said in another note that a majority of its members were “still undecided. ” Later, standing outside the courthouse on an overcast day, members of Mr. Scott’s family said they were not dwelling on a trial they had hoped would end with Mr. Slager bound for prison. “God is my strength, and I know without a doubt that he is a just God,” said Mr. Scott’s mother, Judy Scott. “Injustice will not prevail. ”",0
20448,20448,Asteroid Warning System Found ‘City-Killer’ Object Heading Toward Earth,Alex Ansary,"Asteroid Warning System Found ‘City-Killer’ Object Heading Toward Earth 11/01/2016 
DAILY CALLER 
NASA’s new asteroid warning system detected a large “city-killer” asteroid hurtling toward Earth less than a week before it narrowly missed. 
The rock, officially named 2016 UR36, was first detected Oct. 25 by a telescope in Hawaii and passed by Earth five days later. The asteroid missed by a distance of only 310,000 miles, around 1.3 times further away than the Moon. That’s incredibly close in space terms. 
2016 UR36 could be up to 82 feet across, roughly comparable in size to the meteor that exploded over Russia in February 2013, causing hundreds of injuries . 
If 2016 UR36 had slammed into Earth, it would have struck with a force 55 times stronger than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima near the end of World War II. That’s more than enough force to level a city. 
NASA director Charles Bolden told reporters in 2013 that the only response to a such a late detection of an asteroid set to collide with Earth was to “ Pray .” 
Global asteroid detection programs found more than 15,176 near-Earth objects of all sizes with 1,562 new near-Earth objects being identified this year alone, according to International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planets Center . These newly discovered near-Earth objects are part of a much larger population of more than 700,000 known asteroids in our Solar System. 
NASA and its European partners are now focused on finding objects that are 450 feet in diameter or larger, which could devastate a city or country if they struck Earth. 
In the event an asteroid couldn’t be prevented from hitting Earth, the Planetary Defense Coordination Office would work with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of Defense, and other federal agencies to coordinate disaster response.",1

20450,20450,"Despite Cancer Diagnosis and Husband’s Death, Keeping a Positive Outlook - The New York Times",John Otis,"Recalling that moment four years ago, when Gertrudis Torres learned she had Stage 3 breast cancer, still causes her breathing to become heavy and tears to well up. The unthinkable diagnosis was another blow to Ms. Torres’s family. Two years before, in 2010, her husband, Pedro Ayala, was told that he had throat cancer. Her first thoughts after receiving the news were about her son and daughter. How could they be left alone if their parents died? Who would care for them? “It’s like when you’re playing and somebody grabs ahold of you and you try to move but you can’t,” Ms. Torres, 45, said. “It’s not that you don’t want to. It’s like somebody’s holding you. ” In March 2013, she began chemotherapy at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in the Bronx. In May, after years of treatment, her husband died, leaving Ms. Torres to look after their son, Divian, 16, and their daughter, Yeslly, 11. Ms. Torres said she had even more motivation to beat her disease, even as her substantial grief and her weakened physical strength made the challenge seem impossible at times. “I don’t think cancer kills the people,” she said. “It’s how they take it. ” During her treatments, she observed other cancer patients whose   faces bore witness to the horrors of the disease. She told herself she would not end up like that. “I know we’re all going to die one day,” Ms. Torres said. “But when they say, ‘You have cancer,’ all people think, ‘You’re going to die now.’ And the cancer takes them. ” Every day before she went to the hospital for treatment, she dressed up with vigor and excitement, as if going to a fancy dinner or a happening nightclub, donning stylish wigs and makeup. “I would try to be strong,” Ms. Torres said. Her cancer has been in remission since 2014, but Ms. Torres stays active to fight off the remaining physical pain. On occasion, she and Divian play basketball at a park in the Bronx. Most mornings, Ms. Torres takes long walks around a running track, a form of meditative exercise. However, tight finances have become an inescapable part of the family’s life. Ms. Torres has been out of work for years. She left a job as a cashier when her husband fell ill, and it was difficult to return to work when she started her own treatment. The family receives $935 in Social Security disability payments every month. There is no room for extra expenses. In January, Yeslly came home from school with a note asking for $200 to pay her   graduation dues. She attends Community School 61, a Children’s Aid Society school in the Bronx. The Children’s Aid Society is one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times’s Neediest Cases Fund. Unsure how she could afford the $200, Ms. Torres contacted the school for help. The Children’s Aid Society used $170 in Neediest funds to help. The agency previously assisted the family last December, giving them $300 in gift cards to buy clothing and other necessities. After a caseworker visited the Torreses’ home earlier this year, an additional $900 was used to buy two new beds. Ms. Torres and Yeslly had been sharing a twin bed, while Divian slept on a sofa. The agency also used Neediest funds to buy them a kitchen table. “Thank God we got a table,” Ms. Torres said. “We can go to the table and eat together. Pray first, then eat the food. ” In September, the family moved into a bigger apartment in the Bronx. Ms. Torres said she remained optimistic about her health and the family’s future. She said she hoped her children would attend college. Ms. Torres has career ambitions of her own. She plans to work on getting her high school equivalency diploma, and wants to become a medical assistant, a desire she has had for more than a year. Despite her hardships, and the loss of her husband that still weighs heavily on her and her children, Ms. Torres wakes up each morning thanking God for his blessings. She tells Divian and Yeslly to be grateful for another day of life and that fear has no place in their home. “It’s all about having a positive ” Ms. Torres said. “Whatever you think, that’s what you attract. Negative attracts negative. Positive attracts positive. ”",0

20452,20452,"R. Alexander Acosta, Law School Dean, Is Trump’s New Pick for Labor - The New York Times",Alan Rappeport,"WASHINGTON  —   Moving quickly after his first choice for labor secretary withdrew his nomination amid controversy, President Trump made a seemingly safe selection on Thursday in R. Alexander Acosta, a Florida law school dean and former assistant attorney general. In Mr. Acosta, Mr. Trump has chosen a nominee with deep experience in labor relations, law and education. The pick answers concerns about the lack of diversity in the Trump administration, in that Mr. Acosta would be the first Hispanic in the president’s cabinet. And his chances of being confirmed appear relatively high, since Mr. Acosta, currently the dean of Florida International University’s law school, has made it through the Senate process three times for different roles. “Alex is going to be a key part of achieving our goal of revitalizing the American economy, manufacturing and labor force,” Mr. Trump said as he called on the Senate to confirm Mr. Acosta swiftly. A Miami native, Mr. Acosta’s most relevant experience to the job of labor secretary is his time at the National Labor Relations Board, where he was a member from 2002 to 2003, under President George W. Bush. Mr. Bush later tapped Mr. Acosta to be assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil rights division, one of the highest positions at the agency. He went on to become the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where his office prosecuted the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, the terrorism suspect Jose Padilla and founders of the Cali cartel. He achieved the conviction of Charles Taylor Jr. the son of Liberia’s former leader, for torture. His official biography said his office also prosecuted several   cases and targeted health care fraud. Mr. Acosta’s record and writings will undergo close scrutiny in the weeks before his confirmation hearing. But some of the most outspoken skeptics of the previous labor nominee, the   executive Andrew F. Puzder, have already expressed optimism and   about Mr. Acosta. “I am thrilled that at long last, we have a Hispanic in this cabinet,” said Javier Palomarez, president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, who was critical of Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. Labor groups that assailed Mr. Puzder as being   applauded the choice of Mr. Acosta. “Unlike Andy Puzder, Alexander Acosta’s nomination deserves serious consideration,” said Richard L. Trumka, president of the A. F. L. . I. O. trade union. “In one day, we’ve gone from a   chain C. E. O. who routinely violates labor law to a public servant with experience enforcing it. ” Mr. Puzder withdrew his name from consideration on Wednesday after Republican senators began turning against him. They were concerned about a slew of accusations that had surfaced recently, ranging from Mr. Puzder’s business record to his employment of an undocumented housekeeper to his 1988 divorce. If confirmed, Mr. Acosta could also help smooth the relationship between Mr. Trump and American Muslims who have accused him of fomenting religious discrimination. Testifying before Congress in 2011 at a hearing about the civil rights of American Muslims, Mr. Acosta made a forceful appeal that they should be viewed as any other American community would. “Now is a good time to remember that no community has a monopoly on any particular type of crime,” he said. Despite the early praise Mr. Acosta has received, it is far from certain that his confirmation will be easy. Progressive groups, such as the Democratic “super PAC” American Bridge, were busy on Thursday digging through his background and looking for stains on his record. One area of potential concern is a 2008 investigation by the Justice Department’s inspector general, which looked into whether hiring practices and case assignments at the civil rights division he led were based on political affiliations. A report on the case found that Mr. Acosta had ignored warning signs about such problems. Another pitfall could be a 2004 letter to a federal judge in Ohio that Mr. Acosta sent while he was at the Justice Department, justifying “vote caging” in the presidential election. The practice, in which private citizens in Ohio challenged the eligibility of   voters, was widely seen as a Republican strategy to disenfranchise minorities. Both issues came up when Mr. Acosta was interviewing to become dean of the University of Florida’s law school in 2014. Michelle Jacobs, a professor at the school, said that she and her colleagues were uncomfortable with how Mr. Acosta explained the   case. She also said Mr. Acosta had described paying lip service to lawmakers when called to testify before Congress. “I feel that he lacked some transparency, and he didn’t show a full appreciation for ethical obligations,” Ms. Jacobs said. “We felt it deeply enough that we eliminated him from the list of candidates. ” But colleagues of Mr. Acosta’s at Florida International University said he was widely liked as a leader of the law school, striking a healthy balance of being   without micromanaging. A father of two daughters and a lover of science fiction, Mr. Acosta is known within his department for being humble and genial. “I was actually stunned that Donald Trump would make such a sensible choice,” said José Gabilondo, an F. I. U. law professor who has worked closely with Mr. Acosta. “He’s a very mature person with a sense of decorum, and I think he’ll make a very big contribution to the administration. ”",0
20453,20453,Electronic Voting Machines Caught Switching Trump Votes To Hillary: “Trying to Steal Texas” | Survival,beforeitsnews.com,"(Before It's News)
This article was written by Michael Snyder and originally published at Economic Collapse blog .
Editor’s Comment: In particular with electronic voting, the opportunity to flip votes and steal elections is almost unstoppable and will be very difficult to hold accountable. Nonetheless, that is exactly what activists in Texas and other key states should focus on. After decades of solid “red state” status, they are now talking openly about Hillary winning the Lone Star State and flipping it blue… despite being perhaps the most despised, unlikable and untrustworthy presidential candidate in modern history.
Take a look at the electoral college, and the shades of ‘blue and red states’ as things have been… if Team Hillary is able to steal Texas, there will be no way for Trump to win 270 electoral college, even if he wins Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and other swing states. Perhaps this has been their secret weapon all along, and the reason that she has been so arrogant throughout the entire campaign:
These are dangerous times, and the establishment – after systematically denying the voice of the people on many fronts – is now making a huge gamble at holding onto power even in the face of obvious fraud. Will there be any legitimacy left in this country? And what happens if/when this election is stolen and everyone knows it?
It Is Happening Again! Voting Machines Are Switching Votes From Donald Trump To Hillary Clinton
by Michael Snyder
Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.
Most Americans don’t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney’s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.
Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times …
“I don’t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,” said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.
Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .
“I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney’s name,” Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.
She said that the first time she pushed “Romney,” the machine marked “Obama.”
So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.
“Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,” she told Fox News.
And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.
For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.
If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren’t even worth mentioning.
And of course this didn’t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .
The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.
In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper …
Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes “switched.” The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.
And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas …
Gary and I went to early vote today…I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn’t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don’t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.
I don’t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.
A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas …
Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone’s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!
And of course they weren’t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon …
So is there a serious problem with the voting machines?
According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots…
Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a “software update” on ES&S machines that otherwise “omit one race” when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.
Let’s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump’s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.
But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.
Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are “no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate“…
In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:
Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote
Close to 3 million registered in multiples states
Approximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate
More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters
Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state
But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled “ Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead “…
Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.
Americans overall are more confident that the nation’s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner.
Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media.
And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up …
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia’s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.
Now that is a real “conspiracy theory”, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn’t so serious.
During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it.
The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us.
And let’s watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.",1
20454,20454,Political Fashion Statements at the Men’s Wear Shows - The New York Times,Guy Trebay,"Of course, reality intruded. Fabulousness is no barricade against politics. Reacting to President Trump’s executive order banning the entry of citizens from seven   nations and refugees from any country, designers who are showing their work during the four days of men’s fashion in New York expressed dissent in gestures that, while mainly small and symbolic, added gravitas to the usual   antics and overall frivolity.   models in Robert James’s show at the New York Men’s Day event on Monday carried placards   with pointed messages: “Made in a Sanctuary City” and “Bridges Not Walls. ” At a Private Policy presentation that afternoon, members of a multiracial cast clad in quilted bomber jackets and hot pants had words like “terrorist” stenciled on foreheads or cheeks. Taking a bow at the end of a show on Tuesday, in which models’ faces were obscured behind neoprene ski masks, the   designer Robert Geller wore a sweatshirt that read: “Immigrant. ” And in a spirited introduction to Nick Graham’s   collection on Tuesday, presented against a giant projection of Earth seen from space, Bill Nye  —   the “Science Guy”  —   addressed   deniers with a paean to our fragile atmosphere. You only have to go backstage to see models from nearly every point on the globe  —   India, Mongolia, China and Sudan were just some of the countries that have been represented here this week  —   and to understand that fashion is a plurality undertaking. Sure, the panoply of multiethnic faces is a relatively new addition to a business not always known for welcoming diversity. Yet behind the scenes, fashion has always been global, as Fern Mallis, the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, said Tuesday afternoon. “You have no idea how many visa forms I filled out in my career,” Ms. Mallis said, referring to her work on behalf of the craftspeople from distant countries whose skills were essential if American designers’ visions were to be realized. The garment industry itself was built by immigrants, Ms. Mallis noted of a business that continues to be one of the city’s top economic drivers.   societal anxieties seemed to inject themselves into the proceedings in other ways. Take a Krammer  Stoudt presentation frankly inspired by     transients, one in which the baggy layers often worn by “crustys,” or gutter punks, were used as a form of armoring. Or look at the N. Hoolywood show inspired by the designer Daisuke Obana’s and the stylist Tsuyoshi Nimora’s observations of homeless people on a recent   trip. Wearing dazed expressions that made some look as though they had forgotten to take their meds, an array of   models paraded around a Chelsea showroom. The coats they wore were adapted from utility blankets slung over multiple layers. One model wore a denim jacket pulled over a woolen coat squeezed atop a nubby Aran Island fisherman’s sweater that was tucked into a pair of the baggy pants that have been all the rage in Tokyo for a while now and that are slowly making inroads in the West. Still another jacket was knotted at the neck like a scarf. Streets and rail yards are familiar territory in fashion. Few can forget John Galliano’s “homeless chic” 2000 show for Dior, in which purposely raggedy models strutted onto the runway swathed in “newspapers,” clothes with torn linings or   labels, frayed tulle glad rags, belts slung with little green empties of JB whiskey. Editorial writers, homeless advocates and moralists in general seized on that show as proof that fashion and its narcissistic practitioners are hopelessly disconnected from the real world. Yet what those who are quick to deride it often forget is that the glass of fashion is mostly a reflective device. Sure, Mr. Galliano may have misjudged his moment, given that the 2000 Dior collection coincided with a series of raids on shelters and arrests of the homeless directed by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the mayor of New York at the time. The N. Hoolywood collection could also be judged insensitive. Yet it served as a reminder of an often invisible population  —   one that, in light of recent studies showing that in almost no place in the United States can a person working a   week at minimum wage afford a   apartment at fair market rent, seems destined to increase. Home and homecoming were a theme at Billy Reid’s show Monday evening, held in the Cellar of the Beekman hotel, a chic   nestled in the financial district, whose tall structures and windy streets on a cold winter night evoked the “cathedral of Januaries” Frank O’Hara wrote about in “Avenue A. ” The moody, elliptical O’Hara poem was recited at the show by the Tony   actor Alex Sharp to a room full of guests eager to welcome Mr. Reid on his return to the New York fashion fold. “It’s good to be here,” the designer said to the crowd, referring to a period when he sat out the show cycle. And if it is good, indeed, to have the genial Southerner around again, that has less to do with the largely generic designs he presented in a collection inspired, he said, by the Beats (though some elements were more reminiscent of the stuff he used to design for the golfer Greg Norman) than because of his steady and grounding presence in a sometimes shaky industry. Also, he gives a good party. For the last eight summers, Mr. Reid has staged a festival of music, food, drinks and fashion in Florence, Ala. and on Monday, he gathered around him friends from many realms, including the musicians Winston Marshall and the Watson Twins. “Conceptually, it’s about people sharing their talents and inspiring each other,” Mr. Reid said. He also brought in the blues musician Cedric Burnside to offer his rendition of “Love Her ’Til I Die,” along with Karen Elson, the luminous British model turned Nashville singer, who took to a microphone with a tune from her new album, “Double Roses,” as models of both sexes ambled through the crowd. Even without the abundant bourbon, Mr. Reid’s show would surely have had the loose, homey quality of a party you hope will keep going. In this case it did. When it ended, the subterranean space at the Beekman became the “Speakeasy,” and those who didn’t have an early call the next morning stayed on, dancing to the music of a jazz band, Billy and the Rock Bottoms, and a D. J. set by Mr. Marshall. It can almost be predicted that unpredictable pairings will pop up during men’s week, which comes to a close Thursday night, and this one was no exception. Mr. Reid was inspired by the Beats, and so, too, somehow, was Steve Aoki, a star D. J. whose Dim Mak line of   clothes, new to New York, has in only four seasons become a hit in Japan. “I wanted to embody the roots of what all that came from,” Mr. Aoki said in an interview Monday morning at the Roxy Hotel, referring to the punk music he listened to during his college days at the University of California, Santa Barbara. By Mr. Aoki’s reckoning, the lineage of the punk musicians he worshiped (“I almost fell to my knees when I met Jello Biafra,” he said of the Dead Kennedys singer) began with an “upstart hippie movement” that had its counterculture origins in the Beats. “Music is my breadwinner, but fashion is my creative outlet,” said Mr. Aoki, who, in an attempt to be disruptive (though “not obvious”) used quotes from and images of William S. Burroughs throughout his collection. Happily, Mr. Aoki’s music career is thriving since his debut outing at New York Fashion Week: Men’s was paid for from his own pocket. “It’s terrifying to me to show this to critics,” Mr. Aoki said, “but I accept that there are people that won’t accept me. ” His response to that hurdle, he said, is “to just go for it. ” He needn’t have worried. Not only was the Dim Mak collection of   pink hoodies, oversize coats and khakis, and jackets printed with details from paintings by Mr. Aoki’s good friend, the artist (and early Facebook shareholder) David Choe, creditable on a design level, but the presentation itself made for one of the better shows in recent recollection. Having constructed two halfpipes in a large studio at Skylight Clarkson North in Lower Manhattan, the event space for most of the New York Fashion Week: Men’s shows, Mr. Aoki cast 20 local skateboarders to model the collection as they dropped in and did tricks at breakneck speed. With shirttails or coattails flying, skaters like Jazz Leeb, Caleb Yuan, Shane Medanich and Manu Kondo (the sole woman) barreled and spun and rotated across the ramps with, in the background, Mr. Choe and his   band, Mangchi, blaring away at   volume. Backstage after his turn on the ramp, the skateboarder Jordan Zoscak hooted and   Dean Mendez, another athlete. “We nailed it!” Mr. Zoscak said. And it’s true. They did.",0

20456,20456,"For Democrats, Anthony Weiner Makes an Unwelcome Return - The New York Times",Maggie Haberman and Alexander Burns,"Carolyn B. Maloney, a congresswoman from the Upper East Side, was riding in a taxi on Friday when she heard the news: Emails discovered in an investigation into Anthony D. Weiner’s sexting had revived the F. B. I. ’s interest in the case of Hillary Clinton’s private server. “I said: ‘Oh, no, not this, not happening now,’” she said. And then Ms. Maloney’s thoughts turned to Mr. Weiner. “I can’t stand him  —   even before this,” Ms. Maloney said. On the West Coast, John L. Burton, the chairman of the California Democratic Party, informed of Mr. Weiner’s inadvertent intrusion into the election on Friday evening, let loose an emphatic expletive. “We’re still talking about that guy during a presidential election?” Mr. Burton fumed, using a profane   word instead of “guy. ” Weiner  —   the name became almost a curse word among senior Democrats over the past two days, as the disgraced congressman unexpectedly surfaced in the final stretch of the presidential contest. The news resurrected memories of previous Weiner scandals. “He is like a recurring nightmare,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton. “It’s like one of those ‘Damien’ movies  —   it’s like every time you think he’s dead, he keeps coming again. ” The fury that many leading Democrats feel toward Mr. Weiner had been building for years. His sexting habits embarrassed them. His attempted political comeback in 2013 disgusted them. But their high regard for his   wife, Huma Abedin, always kept them from going public. On Friday that was over. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers and an influential Clinton supporter, said she had long held her tongue out of “enormous respect and love” for Ms. Abedin. But Ms. Weingarten said Mr. Weiner’s treatment of women demanded forceful censure. “I don’t care who it is, no one should be a sexual predator,” Ms. Weingarten said. “I think we all have to take a stand about that, and I think what’s happening now is that people are. ” Mr. Weiner, who lost his seat in Congress and his mayoral hopes after repeated episodes in which he sent lewd messages to women, is now under federal investigation for allegedly sending sexual messages to a    girl in North Carolina. In that inquiry, the F. B. I. this month seized a laptop that contained thousands of messages belonging to Ms. Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton. The F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, told Congress on Friday that investigators will now review those messages for possible relevance to the Clinton inquiry, news that rattled the Clinton campaign and stung her supporters. For some, the development touched off more worry than anger: former President Bill Clinton, who learned of the news en route to his last event of the day, in Pennsylvania, fretted that it would draw hostile attention to Ms. Abedin, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Around the country, former aides to Mr. Weiner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, traded emails and texts throughout the weekend, fuming at the “collateral damage” inflicted by their onetime boss. Mr. Weiner did not respond to an email seeking comment. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has largely ignored Mr. Weiner’s connection so far, and has instructed campaign surrogates to avoid discussing his role. But amid fears that Mr. Weiner’s behavior might undermine the party in a critical election, Democrats  —   especially in his native New York  —   said that perhaps they had given Mr. Weiner too many second chances over the years, and given him too much latitude out of deference to Ms. Abedin. Beyond New York, there was a sense of disbelief that one former lawmaker, whose memorable surname and lewd online habits made him a staple of   comedy, could disrupt the election of an American president. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in an interview with CNN, blurted out, “Oh, God,” at the mention of Mr. Weiner’s name. He added, “I’m not a big fan. ” But Mr. Weiner has been a figure of consternation in Democratic politics for years, in New York and nationally, regarded simultaneously as a sharp political mind and a man of striking immaturity and   ambition. With a gift for combat on cable television, Mr. Weiner repeatedly forced himself to the fore of Democratic politics, despite being seen by many in the party as too clever by half, too boastful about his intelligence  —   and too hungry for attention from reporters and women. A 2001 story in Vanity Fair captured Mr. Weiner, then unmarried, leering at congressional interns while presenting himself as an   salesman. When Mr. Weiner explored a campaign for mayor in 2009, aides to Michael R. Bloomberg, who was seeking a third term, highlighted media coverage of his support for legislation making it easier for foreign models to get approval for visas. “We had a sense of who he was,” said Bradley Tusk, who was campaign manager for Mr. Bloomberg. “He knew exactly who he was. ” Also before the same election, Senator Chuck Schumer, for whom Mr. Weiner once worked, privately expressed frustration that Mr. Weiner was insufficiently interested in substance, telling one aide: “It’s all political ricochet. ” The senator is said to have made his peace with Mr. Weiner’s problems long ago. But Mr. Schumer is in line to lead Senate Democrats next year, and any damage from Mr. Weiner’s latest scandal could impede the party’s quest for a majority. Still, he won the lasting appreciation of Mrs. Clinton during the 2008 election, defending her in   fashion during a difficult primary against Barack Obama. And Mr. Weiner’s marriage to Ms. Abedin, in 2010, seemed to install him permanently among party elites  —   whatever their reservations about his company. So tied into the party’s power brokers was he, by marriage, that when Mr. Weiner sought to resurrect his political career with a bid for mayor in 2013, numerous Democratic donors cut checks to his campaign at Ms. Abedin’s urging. John P. Coale, a wealthy lawyer supportive of Mrs. Clinton, said many donors gave money to Mr. Weiner out of friendship with Ms. Abedin. But Mr. Coale said the 2013 race, which brought new revelations of more sexting, had been exasperating. “It was just too much for everybody,” Mr. Coale said. “And now, it’s out of the park. Come on. ” Bill Hyers, a Democratic strategist who managed Mayor Bill de Blasio’s campaign that year, said the party establishment had erred by allowing Mr. Weiner “a second breath of life. ” “They knew he was a narcissist who was massively flawed,” Mr. Hyers said. “And now we’re all still stuck with him. ” Among Democrats who shunned Mr. Weiner from the start, there was little joy at the apparent vindication of their judgment. Sarah Kovner, a major Democratic donor, said there was less concern that   injuries might cost Mrs. Clinton the election, than sheer frustration that a known bad seed had created such endless tumult. “We basically never wanted to have anything to do with him,” Ms. Kovner said of herself and her husband, Victor Kovner. “  too wise for himself, too glib, too full of himself  —   that’s how we felt about him. ” While predicting Mr. Weiner’s latest scandal would not doom Mrs. Clinton’s presidential hopes, Ms. Kovner sighed: “It is more pain. ”",0
20457,20457,"In a Big Hole for a Detroit House, but Happy - The New York Times",Ron Lieber,"DETROIT  —   Many residents of   areas entertain the dream, at least occasionally: Give up the rent or mortgage grind, liquidate assets and start over someplace cheaper, perhaps one that could use a few spirited new residents. Amy Haimerl and her husband, Karl Kaebnick, fell hard for Detroit and thought they could make their own dream of financial freedom come true when they moved here in 2013. But this is what happened: They put more than $400, 000 (including all of their retirement savings) into a       home in the city’s West Village neighborhood that was most recently appraised at just $300, 000. They claim, however, to be 100 percent satisfied and genuinely happy. Which raises a question: Are they insane? Ms. Haimerl’s book about their migration and renovation adventure, “Detroit Hustle,” will be out on May 3. It’s a love song sung to a house and a city, but it’s also a money memoir, one marked by ignorance at the outset and a triumph of feelings over financial facts. It does not end in ruin, but it does end in debt. So let’s start with those facts. Ms. Haimerl, who is 40, and Mr. Kaebnick, 44, had about $10, 000 in liquid assets when they decided to move. They settled on a house on a block where only two homes were boarded up. They bought the smaller one, a wreck with no wires or radiators or doors or pipes, for $35, 000, liquidating Ms. Haimerl’s retirement account to close without a mortgage. “There is essentially nothing left inside the walls,” she writes in her book. “What we have is a pile of bricks with character. ” For the renovation, they were counting on the $110, 000 that would be left from Mr. Kaebnick’s accounts. The previous owners had figured it would take $150, 000 or so to make it habitable. What could go wrong? Well, the couple was missing two crucial bits of knowledge, one about the Detroit market and the other about themselves. First, they realized only after they had bought the house that there were no construction loans available. That was because there wasn’t any evidence that after renovation, homes like theirs would be worth more than what it would cost to fix them. So whatever work the couple wanted to do, they would have to pay for it themselves. Then, they could try to get a mortgage after the work was done and take out cash to repay any other debts they incurred along the way. And it turned out that there were a lot of those debts, in part because the couple misjudged the amount of work they would need and want to do. They started by looking at options for doing just $100, 000 of work, but that might have forced them to move in without any water. The only contractor who made them feel comfortable figured it would take $300, 000. He went to work, and they ended up spending $400, 000 total, not including the purchase price. You’ve heard versions of this story before, but the specifics here involved a balcony from a crumbling church that made incredible wainscoting but begged for matching custom woodwork and installation that eventually cost $65, 000. So they borrowed $75, 000 from Ms. Haimerl’s father and $40, 000 from her grandparents and aunt. Mr. Kaebnick’s family chipped in with kitchen appliances in lieu of a wedding or a gift, and the rest came from a $25, 000 Lending Club loan, $50, 000 in USAA personal loans and some credit card debt. The result is by no means extravagant, though it is a lot of space for two people with no designs on having children. The interior trim is bare, and the house still needs paint in many rooms. It’s missing a porch, and the garage out back is crumbling. On paper, Ms. Haimerl is about the last person you would expect to go all in like this. She grew up poor and lost a house to a foreclosure in Denver several years ago, when a previous relationship disintegrated. She has even worked as a personal finance editor. The money scold in me believes she should have known better, but she believes she knows plenty. “As a contractor’s daughter, I grew up with men who want to do it right,” she said. “You don’t skimp on work now because you pay for it later. ” So they shored up the roof and rebuilt the rear of the structure. Then, there is her take on retirement. Her father had $75, 000 to lend to her because he had been forced to liquidate a   business that he built after the family’s earlier lean years. “I never grew up with any idea that there would be retirement,” she said. “You were trying not to go to a payday lender. My dad’s retirement was supposed to be the business. ” Ms. Haimerl is a writer and Mr. Kaebnick is a computer programmer, and perhaps they can work well into their 70s or 80s. In the meantime, their net worth is negative. They did get a mortgage after the work was done, and the appraiser assigned the $300, 000 value to their home, a triumph in their neighborhood at the time. They pulled most of that money out in a mortgage to repay many of their other debts and write a giant check to their contractor, Calvin Garfield. They still owe him about $80, 000, but aspiring Detroit residents should not expect loose terms if they come to town. “I’m confident other contractors would not have made the same call,” Mr. Garfield said. “But I do think everyone we have done business with has become a friend, and in that mix of things, this seemed to be the right thing to do. ” The couple desperately wants to repay him, and because their income is just over $100, 000, they expect to do so sooner rather than later. Ms. Haimerl freelances, and they have an Airbnb side business going using some of that 3, 000 square feet. For just $65 a night, aspiring Detroit residents can soak up plenty of   advice and bear witness to the kind of house that a lot of money and worry can buy. But how best to explain away their lack of retirement savings? Plenty of people who sank their life savings into real estate in less desirable parts of Brooklyn or San Francisco a decade or two ago are probably thrilled. So is that how they think about the money they have put into their Detroit dream? That they bet on a city instead of a bunch of stocks? “We have gotten   about talking that way,” Ms. Haimerl said. “People here say, ‘How dare you treat our city like an investment. ’” Mr. Kaebnick said he understood the sentiment. “So many people who stuck it out here for so long never had anything to show for it,” he said. “To them, we might come across as privileged newcomers who are going to ride it to the bank. ” In fact, they are true believers who love the city enough to go all in and then some. Others have found their own way of demonstrating their commitment to the city, and at least one of them, Drew Philp, is writing his own book about the house he bought for $500 and fixed up without borrowing anything. His BuzzFeed story about the experience describes the two winters he had without much, if any, heat, among many other unsettling experiences. Families without the means for $400, 000 investments or the fortitude to see their breath indoors can buy houses that have electricity and running water for half that amount or less. And a new program called Detroit Home Mortgage aims to make it possible for people to get loans before they start their renovations. In the meantime, Ms. Haimerl and Mr. Kaebnick have not found financial freedom in Detroit, though they insist that they are so much richer for having moved. In a poignant moment early in her book, Ms. Haimerl describes gazing longingly into a window in a newly gentrified Denver neighborhood, before her dream of homeownership there turned into a nightmare. The living room looked like luxury, a place where the residents weren’t constantly hustling to hold things together. Aspiring homeowners in Detroit may well walk down her street someday soon, see her through the window and wonder how she had it so good. Would they be jealous? Should they be? “I thought maybe that once you were inside the window, you didn’t have to hustle,” she said. “But the truth is, we’re all hustling. ”",0
20458,20458,"Dem Wingnut James Carville Melts Down, Says 'KGB' Controls FBI - Edmund Kozak",nan,"People over profits Dem Wingnut James Carville Melts Down, Says 'KGB' Controls FBI 
The Democratic strategist calls reopened Clinton probe an 'attack' on American democracy in a MSNBC tantrum   PoliZette 
Famed Democratic strategist James Carville may be the first Clinton surrogate to have officially lost his mind over the FBI’s decision to reopen its investigation into Clinton’s private email server. 
In an appearance on MSNBC on Monday, Carville relentlessly — and repeatedly — attacked the FBI’s decision to reopen the investigation, asserting it is part of a conspiracy to subvert American democracy. 
Apparently the fact that the Soviet security agency was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast, anti-Clinton, FBI-organized conspiracy, according to Carville. Poor Carville was clearly apoplectic at the news of Comey’s announcement, describing it as an assault or attack on American democracy multiple times.“This is in effect an attempt to hijack an election,” Carville claimed. “It’s unprecedented … the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy,” he said. 
He was also adamant about who was responsible. “Comey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans,” Carville said. “We also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked,” he added. 
Carville was very upset that Comey's announcement thrust Clinton's behavior back into the spotlight. ""It would seem to me that the FBI shouldn't be getting rolled by the House Republicans, that's what happened here — there's nothing else that's going on — and in the meantime … democracy is under assault by the KGB,"" he said. ""To me that's something we ought to be talking about."" 
Unfortunately for Carville, fanciful tales about time-traveling Soviet spies and an FBI in the GOP's pocket certainly make for interesting entertainment — but they pale in importance to the real-life stories of Clinton's brazen lawlessness. 
When the MSNBC anchor dared raise the fact that Democrats were praising Comey only a few months ago when he announced the FBI's decision not to recommend indictment, Carville went into a stuttering, sputtering fit. 
""When the facts change I change my mind,"" Carville said. ""Why are you defending this, why are you sitting here as American democracy is under assault?"" he asked. 
""This is an unprecedented event that was done on behalf of the House Republicans,"" Carville repeated. ""And as we know the KGB is all over this election and this is what we are talking about? We ought to be talking about [how] our democracy is under assault right now and what we are going to do about it, not [what somebody said in July] about James Comey.""",1
20459,20459,Burnt homes and broken promises: the Jungle evicted,Rowan Wolf,"[Graphic: Calais street scene by Harriet Paintin of Bow and Brush .] =By= Harriet Paintin and Hannah Kirmes-Daly Editor's Note The news of the destruction of the Calais refugee camp, known as “The Jungle”, has been pointed to by many as part of the hardening of European hearts to the terrible plight of refugees who have made it to their shores. It is relatively easy to make appropriate noises and go on with one’s life, but add a visual component and what remains is much more haunting. This can be particularly true with an artiti’s hand in the mix for his or her feelings and impressions are carried forward and the painting (or sculpture, or sometimes photograph) places us as a surrogate in that place and time. This clearly happens with this article so read at your own risk … and I hope you will. L ast week saw the brutal destruction of the Calais Jungle, Europe’s largest unregulated refugee camp and home to around 10,000 people who have built communities, collective solidarity and even an autonomous economy. The eviction of the camp yet again calls into question Europe’s asylum policy as refugees who have fled war, persecution and destruction once again witnessed their homes and community spaces razed to the ground, this time as part of a “humanitarian effort”. French authorities declared on Wednesday that the camp was empty, but hundreds of people — including unaccompanied minors — remain in an incredibly precarious position, sleeping rough and at risk of arrest. Unlike most refugee camps in Europe where food and facilities are provided by authorities, the Jungle evolved as a relatively autonomous entity, more like a shanty town than a camp. Restaurants, shops, barber shops and community spaces lined the muddy high street, which served not only as small commercial enterprises, but also as spaces of collective solidarity where people would gather, share information and build their community. Without these networks of support, the experience of being a refugee is infinitely more isolating and confusing. The Day Before the Eviction The day before the eviction a tense, uneasy mood settled among the residents of the Jungle, many of whom decided to leave on their own terms. Rather than giving up their autonomy and freedom for a place on one of the state provided buses to “Healthcare and Advice Clinics” (CAOs) and detention centers across the country, they left before they could be forced to leave, traveling to Paris, Marseille, anywhere they might have friends or hope of finding shelter. In one of the few restaurants which remained open, people attempted to keep a brave face as they spent the last day among friends with whom they had spent the last few months, years even. Some were resigned to whatever might happen the next day, throwing out light hearted comments to disguise their apprehension, “we’re not scared of the police! We’re Afghan, the police should be scared of us!” A young married couple had only just heard the news of the eviction; they were frantically trying to work out how they could avoid the risks of separation, of detention, and of becoming locked into the French asylum system which is already crumbling in its own inadequacy to provide aid, security and safety to the vulnerable. Aged just 18 and 20 years old, they had traveled together from Eritrea, fleeing the horrors of dictatorship and indefinite military conscription, in search of safety and a life worth living. “I just want a safe place for my wife. We want to build a life together; we can’t live in camps anymore, relying on the state for tiny handouts and waiting in line for food,” exclaimed the young man. The only reassurance they received from a British volunteer was that, as Eritreans, they face little chance of deportation as Europe has finally recognized that Eritrea is an unsafe country, unlike Afghanistan. A middle-aged Afghani man who had been listening in on the conversation interjected at this point, “who says Afghanistan is safe?! You ask your governments how Afghanistan can be safe, while drones and bombs fall from the sky, who sent them?! While your soldiers patrol our villages, who sent them?! Who is responsible for Al-Qaeda, for the Taliban?! Tell me!” Afghanis comprise a significant proportion of the Jungle’s residents. In light of a recent EU agreement with Afghanistan which means that European aid money is dependent on the Afghani government agreeing to accept 80,000 deportees, Afghanis stand little chance of being granted asylum in Europe. This man highlighted the painful contradiction felt by so many in the Jungle, that the nations responsible for so much of the violence in their country turn them away when they seek protection. So many have already had their asylum cases denied in various European countries and now expect to be deported. Their long journeys of flight and hope will end right back where they started. The high street, once a buzzing center of activity, was deserted; the closed shops, restaurants and barber shops reduced to empty shells with broken windows lining a muddy street. The police perimeter was already firmly in place, a man cycling past with plastic bags of clothes was pulled over and interrogated. “It’s just clothes! Nothing else,” he insisted as the policeman in full riot gear roughly pulled out the contents of the bags, revealing just clothes, nothing else. Misinformation and Confusion French authorities claimed that 7,500 beds had been made available, that a simple registration procedure would see people onto buses to transport them to three CAOs across the country, or possibly detention centers. Three different lines for single men, families, and minors, marked out by pictograms. This registration would take place on October 24 and 25, with the demolishment of the camp scheduled for the 25th. Women’s protest ( Harriet Paintin ) This information had been made available far too late to be translated and transmitted to the many languages and residents of the Jungle, meaning that Monday morning began with an overwhelming sense of chaos, disorganization and misinformation that would come to characterize the following days. Scarce scraps of information were filtered down through various organizations on the ground and painstakingly analyzed by everyone, volunteers and refugees alike, in an attempt to understand what was happening. As Clouchard states, “misinformation is to democracy what propaganda agencies are to totalitarian states”. In the context of this eviction the lack of information felt like not just an organizational slip-up, but a deliberate attempt to misinform and mislead people. In the confusion that ensued, people were unable to take balanced, well-informed and empowered decision about their futures; instead, they were herded onto buses that they didn’t even know the destination of. At one point, volunteers tried to hand out maps, to enable refugees to decide between the three locations that were supposed to be on offer to them. Officials shouted back, “this is not allowed, people don’t have a choice, don’t give them a map!” The Registration Process Calais police registration lines ( Harriet Paintin ) With a heavy media and police presence the mood was subdued and access was restricted to accredited media (500 people) and a handful of volunteer organizations. Inside, people packed up their homes and belongings in the cold, gray morning light and headed towards the police lines for registration. The long line of unaccompanied minors waited for their futures to be determined by one woman peering into their face for about 30 seconds to decide if they were under 18. Inside the Jungle however, far from the complete chaos which everyone had been expecting, there were pockets of relative normality as those who did not want to take the buses busied themselves with their daily lives, cooking lunch for their children, playing guitar. As for the official demolition, the police cordoned off a tiny section of the camp and invited journalists to watch as they carefully dismantled it. When the real demolition began the following day all access to the high look-out point in the camp was restricted to journalists, where they would have been able to see the bulldozers and cranes destroying houses, and countless fires breaking out across the camp. Jungle house on fire ( Harriet Paintin ) One of the most noticeable homes on fire was a beautifully constructed two-story building complete with a terrace. The inhabitants had set the house on fire themselves as a symbol of protest; they did not want their home and their memories to be destroyed at the hands of the police. As the smoke climbed into the sky, they laughed and reminisced about their past years in the Jungle. Only three people of a community of more than twenty were left, everybody else had already left, to Paris, to flats in Calais; not a single one was planning on taking the bus. In the midst of this dehumanizing chaos there were several moments of resistance like this where people, for a brief moment at least, were able to take control of their situation and express discontent. Faced with extreme police repression and no individual rights, these actions were incredibly powerful. Individuals carried flags of their home nations up and down the line of policemen who stood stoic and expressionless in their riot gear. The women of the camp, so infrequently visible that their presence has even at times been doubted, organized themselves and protested against their treatment, calling out for “safety and dignity for all women! Underage, overage, we’re all the same! In [camps in] Paris we sleep on the streets!” The Fire At about 3am on Wednesday morning a huge fire started, burning all the homes and possessions left behind. A fire which quickly spread out of control throughout the camp and razed it to the ground, leaving the high street looking like a devastated ghost town. Later, the registration area quickly descended into chaos as people were told that the last buses were leaving that afternoon. The line for minors closed early and hundreds were told to come back the next day. In the midst of this chaos and confusion the destruction of the camp continued in full force as the bulldozers and cranes moved in. Calais Jungle burning scene ( Harriet Paintin ) “It’s exactly like the scenes we have run away from, it’s just like watching our homes being burnt by the rebel forces” gasped one young man from Sudan as he gazed upon the desolation and destruction before him. After the last buses departed, the French authorities and some media outlets reported that the camp had been cleared and the eviction was a success, ignoring the hundreds left behind. Having been turned away by the authorities for the third day running, children were ordered back into a Jungle which by this time had become an apocalyptic scene of burning buildings, toxic smoke, exploding gas canisters. They had nowhere else to go but the streets, with no information about what options are open to them, if any. This eviction may have been dressed up as a “humanitarian effort” but the blatant contradictions between the official line of events and the reality on the ground reveals gaping fault-lines in Europe’s refugee policies. With unaccompanied minors left sleeping on the street, then by no stretch of the imagination has this been a successful operation. Rather, this is nothing but a complete failure on behalf of the authorities who are responsible for their protection. If the eviction was planned with the best interests of the Jungle residents in mind, then it would have worked out in a different way. There has been a refugee camp in Calais since the early 1990s, and after each eviction people have returned to rebuild. Long term residents of the Jungle believe that there is nothing that the authorities can do to stop people coming and trying to reach the UK; they are confident that before long, small camps will spring up again, but without the facilities and systems of mutual cooperation and aid that people have built in the Jungle their survival will be even more precarious.

20460,20460,Doctor Finds New Life As A Clown More Fulfilling | GomerBlog,nan,"Tweet 
Pediatrician Jim Smith is thrilled with his new career as a professional Clown. He specializes in children’s birthday parties but has the skill set to perform at kindergarten graduations as well. “Leaving the hospital was the best thing I’ve ever done. Can I say that again?” said an elated Dr. Jim Smith. 
Dr. Jim Smith first became interested in becoming a Clown after suffering from extreme burnout. Catalysts included helicopter Moms, antivax Jenny Mccarthy supporters, and the general stress of saving the world. After dealing with one particularly overbearing soccer mom, he stormed out of the office ranting, “**** this noise; I can’t take this horse**** anymore!” and never returned. Using obscenities for the first time felt nothing short of liberating. 
Dr. Jim Smith’s new lifestyle is entirely different from the clinic he used to work at. Previously, he woke up at 6am sharp but now he rolls out of bed in the neighborhood of 11:30am to ensure he is prompt for lunchtime birthday contracts. “I take my responsibilities very seriously,” said Dr. Jim Smith proudly. After a solid hour of challenging work, he practices his Downward Dog poses. 
In spite of all the Clown perks, Jim has admittedly taken a rather large pay cut. As a pediatrician, the Doctor made $200,000.00 per year. Now he makes $17,500.00 a year if fully booked and tipped generously. However, Dr. Jim Smith says that eating Ramen noodles with his wife and kids is definitely worth the consistent joy he experiences performing slapstick routines. “Freedom really has no price tag,” said Clown Jim Smith. 
Dr. Jim Smith’s favorite part of the job is showcasing his balloon skills. “Even though the kids cry sometimes, they don’t die,” he stated enthusiastically. Creating these balloon animals has proved to be significantly more meaningful than diagnosing heart defects. 
Dr. Jim Smith sleeps soundly knowing the nurses aren’t “hunting (him) down like cattle.” Instead, parents and children alike watch him smile and laugh as if he’s the greatest entertainer in the world. He even gets to wear a red nose! And doing mime is endlessly entertaining and unpredictable too. 
Dr. Jim Smith’s old colleagues have inquired what degree is needed to become a Clown. They’ve also expressed curiosity as to whether it is a high demand skill. 
Dr. Jim Smith’s only regret is that he didn’t become a Clown sooner. 315 Shares ",1
20461,20461,Betsy DeVos’s Education Hearing Erupts Into Partisan Debate - The New York Times,Kate Zernike and Yamiche Alcindor,"WASHINGTON  —   At her confirmation hearing on Tuesday to be education secretary, Betsy DeVos vigorously defended her work steering taxpayer dollars from traditional public schools, arguing that it was time to move away from a “one size fits all” system and toward newer models for students from preschool to college. The hearing quickly became a heated and partisan debate that reflected the nation’s political divide on how best to spend public money in education. Republicans applauded Ms. DeVos’s work to expand charter schools and school vouchers, which give families public funds to help pay tuition at private schools. Democrats criticized her for wanting to “privatize” public education and pushed her, unsuccessfully, to support making public colleges and universities  . Ms. DeVos, a billionaire with a complex web of investments, including in companies that stand to win or lose from federal education policy, was the first nominee of   Donald J. Trump to have a Senate hearing without completing an ethics review on how she planned to avoid conflicts of interest. Democrats pointed out that in the past, Republicans had insisted that no hearings be conducted before those reviews were complete. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, limited the questioning to one round of five minutes for each senator, prompting howls from Democrats, who noted that previous hearings had included two rounds of questions. “It suggests that this committee is trying to protect this nominee from scrutiny,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. With time limited, Democrats confronted Ms. DeVos with   questions, demanding that she explain her family’s contributions to groups that support   conversion therapy for gay people her donations to Republicans and their causes, which she agreed totaled about $200 million over the years her past statements that government “sucks” and that public schools are a “dead end” and the poor performance of charter schools in Detroit, where she resisted legislation that would have blocked chronically failing charter schools from expanding. Under questioning, Ms. DeVos said it would be “premature” to say whether she would continue the Obama administration’s policy requiring uniform reporting standards for sexual assaults on college campuses. She told Mr. Murphy, whose constituents include families whose children were killed in the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, that it should be “left to locales” to decide whether guns are allowed in schools, and that she supported Mr. Trump’s call to ban   zones around schools. She also denied that she had personally supported conversion therapy. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pressed Ms. DeVos on how she could oversee the Education Department, the largest provider of student loans, given that she had no experience running a large bureaucracy and that neither she nor her children had ever taken out a student loan. “So you have no personal experience with college financial aid?” Ms. Warren asked. Ms. DeVos, who did not attend public schools or send her children to public schools, argued that vouchers and charter schools were simply a way of offering poor parents the kind of school choice that wealthy parents have long been able to afford. She described a visit she and her husband, an heir to the Amway fortune, made to a Christian school in her hometown, Grand Rapids, Mich. as a turning point in her career as a school choice advocate. “We saw the struggles and sacrifices many of these families faced when trying to choose the best educational option for their children,” she said. “For me, this was not just an issue of public policy but of national injustice. ” But Democrats said research showed that voucher programs had done little to raise achievement among poor students. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, asked Ms. DeVos, “Can you commit to us that you will not work to privatize public schools or cut a single penny from public education?” Ms. DeVos began to demur, saying that “not all schools are working for the students that are assigned to them” and that she would work to find “common ground” to give parents “options. ” “I take that as not being willing to commit to not privatizing public education,” Ms. Murray said. Mr. Alexander, himself a former education secretary, argued that Ms. DeVos’s support of charter schools and vouchers put her in the “mainstream” of public opinion, and that her critics were outside it. He noted that charter schools, which are publicly funded but typically run independently of local school districts and teachers’ unions, have been supported by Republican and Democratic presidents going back to Bill Clinton. Democrats, however, argued that Ms. DeVos’s support went well beyond charter schools, to include the more contentious policy of sending public money to private and religious schools. “Charter schools are not the issue here,” said Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, where Democrats pushed the nation’s first law allowing charter schools nearly three decades ago. He noted that 37 states prohibit the use of public dollars for religious schools. One Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, expressed concern about Ms. DeVos’s enthusiasm for school choice  —   a moot point for many of her constituents, given the vastness of her state. “When there is no way to get to an alternative option for your child, the best parent is left relying on a public school system that they demand to be there for their kids,” she said, asking Ms. DeVos to ensure that her commitment to traditional public education was as “strong and robust” as her passion for school choice.",0
20462,20462,Rafael Nadal Wins a Marathon to Set Up a Final With Roger Federer - The New York Times,Ben Rothenberg,"MELBOURNE, Australia  —   Rafael Nadal completed a slate of throwback singles finals at the Australian Open, beating Grigor Dimitrov,       (5)   (4)   in a battle of 4 hours 56 minutes that started Friday evening and ended at 12:44 Saturday morning. In Sunday’s final, Nadal, 30, will face his longtime rival Roger Federer, 35, a nostalgic counterpoint to the women’s championship match between Venus Williams, 36, and Serena Williams, 35. Nadal and Federer have not met in a Grand Slam final since the 2011 French Open. Against Dimitrov, Nadal saved three break points in a tightly fought fifth set, including two at  . With a backhand winner down the line, he earned the crucial break in the next game to go up by   and serve for the match. On Nadal’s third match point, Dimitrov’s final backhand landed long to end a   rally, and Nadal fell to the ground in relief. “Difficult to describe the emotions,” he said in his   interview. “First of all, I was tired. ” That last point was emblematic of how the   Nadal managed to outlast the   Dimitrov, time and again showing his superior physicality in the longest exchanges. The two were more evenly matched on shorter points, but of the 64 points that lasted nine or more shots, Nadal won 39. Dimitrov, 25, had reached only one previous Grand Slam semifinal, at Wimbledon in 2014, but he rarely seemed daunted by the occasion. Already   to start the year and a title in Brisbane to his name, Dimitrov frequently displayed improved power and consistency in the match, even as it wore on into the fifth set, striking 79 winners to 45 for Nadal. But he could not match Nadal’s ability to turn defense into offense few can. Dimitrov’s   backhand was particularly exposed by Nadal’s attacks and counted for the majority of his forced and unforced errors. “It’s never easy to lose a match like that,” Dimitrov said. “I’m happy, though, with a lot of things. I’m going to stay positive and keep my head up high. For sure, Rafa deserves pretty much all the credit right now since he’s such a fighter, such a competitor. At the same time it was an honor for me to play a match like that against him. It also shows me that I’m in a good way, I’m on the right path. ” Nadal started the match with dominant serving, winning 90 percent of points on his serve in the first set. But in the second set, Nadal dropped serve three times and Dimitrov twice. Dimitrov, former   player who tumbled to 40th last summer, held firm after Nadal won the third set in a tiebreaker. Neither player faced a break point in the fourth set, won by Dimitrov in another tiebreaker. Nadal, a   major champion, last reached a Grand Slam final at the 2014 French Open, which he won. He last reached a final in Melbourne earlier that year, losing to Stan Wawrinka. Nadal has missed large stretches of competition in recent years because of various injuries, including a wrist ailment that forced him out of the French Open and Wimbledon last year. “I never, ever dreamed to be back in a final of the Australian Open, the second tournament of the year, after a lot of months without competing,” Nadal said on the court after the match. “But here I am, and I feel lucky, and I feel very, very happy. ” Sunday’s match will be the ninth Grand Slam final between Federer and Nadal, and their second here. In their previous one in 2009, Nadal beat Federer,       (3)     a match perhaps best remembered for Federer’s tearful   speech in the trophy ceremony. That final was also preceded by an epic semifinal for Nadal, who needed 5 hours 14 minutes to put away Fernando Verdasco in five sets. Federer, the No. 17 seed, needed five sets Thursday to take his semifinal against Wawrinka, but that match was nearly two hours shorter than Nadal’s win Friday. Nadal has won 23 of 34 matches against Federer, and 9 of 11 meetings at Grand Slam events. Nadal’s 14 Grand Slam titles is second among active players, behind Federer’s 17. Federer has not won a major tournament since Wimbledon in 2012. “It’s special to play with Roger again in a final of a Grand Slam,” Nadal said. “I cannot lie. It’s great. It’s exciting for me, and for both of us, that we’re still there and we’re still fighting for important events. ” The women’s final Saturday night also will feature the two active players with the most Grand Slam singles titles, with the   winner Serena Williams meeting her sister, the   winner Venus Williams. This is the first Grand Slam tournament in the Open era in which all four singles finalists are 30 or older.",0

20464,20464,Obama Says Republicans Should Withdraw Support for Trump - The New York Times,Michael D. Shear and Nick Corasaniti,"WASHINGTON  —   In an extraordinary denunciation of Donald J. Trump’s temperament and competence, President Obama urged leaders of the Republican Party on Tuesday to withdraw their endorsements of Mr. Trump’s candidacy, flatly calling him “unfit to serve” as the nation’s 45th president. Speaking in the East Room of the White House while Mr. Trump rallied supporters in a nearby Virginia suburb, the president noted the Republican criticism of Mr. Trump for his attacks on the Muslim parents of an American soldier, Capt. Humayun Khan, who died in Iraq. But Mr. Obama said the political recriminations from Republicans “ring hollow” if the party’s leaders continue to support Mr. Trump’s campaign. “The question they have to ask themselves is: If you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?” Mr. Obama said. “What does this say about your party that this is your  ?” The president’s condemnation of Mr. Trump, and his direct appeal to Republicans to abandon their candidate, were stunning even in a city where politics has become a brutal and personal affair. Mr. Obama seemed eager to go beyond his past interventions in the race, which have included forceful rejections of Mr. Trump’s statements and policy proposals. The last time a sitting president was as openly critical of the other party’s candidate, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian, was when President Harry S. Truman mocked Dwight D. Eisenhower during the 1952 campaign. And once Eisenhower was elected, Truman said he did not know “any more about politics than a pig knows about Sunday. ” “It’s a reflection of just how radical and dangerous President Obama feels that Trump is,” Mr. Brinkley said. Using the formal backdrop of a joint news conference with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, Mr. Obama suggested that Mr. Trump would not abide by “norms and rules and common sense” and questioned whether he would “observe basic decency” should he reach the Oval Office. The president said he would have been disappointed to lose in 2008 or 2012, but added that he had never doubted whether his Republican rivals in those races, John McCain and Mitt Romney, could function as president or had the knowledge to make government work. “That’s not the situation here,” Mr. Obama said. As Mr. Obama condemned Mr. Trump, the Republican candidate  —   apparently unaware of the president’s remarks  —   repeatedly criticized his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and the president in an hour of remarks. He called Mrs. Clinton a “liar” and a “thief” and said the country would be “finished” if voters chose four more years of a presidency like Mr. Obama’s. Mr. Trump also accused Mrs. Clinton of repeatedly lying over the weekend when she told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday” that James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, had said her statements about her private emails were truthful. “I mean, she lied,” Mr. Trump said, prompting cries of “Lock her up!” from his supporters. “She, pure and simple, she only knows to lie. She really does. She only knows to lie. But she lied, and it’s a big story. ” Mr. Comey, testifying last month to Congress, said that “we have no basis to conclude she lied to the F. B. I. ” But he also said he could not say whether Mrs. Clinton’s many public statements on the issue were truthful. Mr. Trump, in a written statement meant to respond directly to the president’s remarks, called Mrs. Clinton “unfit to serve in any government office. ” He also accused Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton of allowing Americans to be slaughtered in Benghazi, Libya letting veterans die waiting for medical care and releasing immigrants into the United States to kill innocent people. “Our nation has been humiliated abroad and compromised by radical Islam brought onto our shores,” Mr. Trump’s statement said. “We need change now. ” The dueling appearances by the president and the Republican candidate seeking to replace him escalated the heated political rhetoric in a race that had already devolved into a series of personal attacks and character assassinations. Mr. Obama cited Mr. Trump’s reaction to Captain Khan’s parents, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, as a principal reason for his extended remarks. Mr. Trump had criticized the Khans after they honored their son at the Democratic National Convention and urged people to vote for Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Obama lamented what he called an attack on a “Gold Star family that had made such extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country. ” He said he did not doubt that Republicans were outraged about the statements Mr. Trump and his supporters had made about the Khan family in the last several days. “But there has to come a point at which you say somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn’t have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding, to occupy the most powerful position in the world,” Mr. Obama said. The president did not limit his criticism to Mr. Trump’s treatment of the Khan family. Mr. Obama said the Republican nominee had repeatedly demonstrated that he was “woefully unprepared to do this job. ” The president said Mr. Trump had proved he lacked knowledge about Europe, the Middle East and other parts of Asia. “This isn’t a situation where you have an episodic gaffe. This is daily,” Mr. Obama added. “There has to be a point at which you say, ‘This is not somebody I can support for president of the United States, even if he purports to be a member of my party.’ The fact that that has not yet happened makes some of these denunciations ring hollow. ” Mr. Trump, who spoke at a boisterous rally at Briar Woods High School in Ashburn, Va. began his remarks there by saying a veteran had given him a Purple Heart medal earlier in the day. “I always wanted to get the Purple Heart,” said Mr. Trump, who received five deferments from the draft during the Vietnam War. “This was much easier. ” Throughout his speech, Mr. Trump argued his case that Mrs. Clinton was “unfit” for the presidency, accusing her of being dishonest, weak on foreign policy and corrupt. He accused the president of doubling the national debt and said the Iraq war exit was a “disaster. ” “Let Obama go to the golf course,” Mr. Trump said. “But you know what? We’d be better off. ” At one point during the rally, a crying baby interrupted Mr. Trump’s speech. “Don’t worry about that baby. I love babies,” Mr. Trump said at first. “I hear that baby crying, I like it. What a baby, what a beautiful baby. Don’t worry, don’t worry. ” A few beats later, he changed his tune. “Actually, I was only kidding,” Mr. Trump said. “You can get that baby out of here. ” Laughs and a few gasps escaped from the crowd. “Don’t worry, I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I’m speaking,” Mr. Trump added. “That’s O. K. People don’t understand. That’s O. K. ” Even as Mr. Obama discussed trade policy and security issues with the Singaporean prime minister, Mr. Trump criticized world leaders. He said he would ask Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany “what went wrong” in her country. And he criticized Mrs. Clinton for what he called “terrible relations” with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. At the White House, Mr. Lee of Singapore responded to a question about Mr. Trump with diplomacy, and said Singapore would look forward to working with whomever Americans chose as president. “Many pressures build up during the election campaign, and after the elections in a calmer, cooler atmosphere, positions are rethought, strategies are nuanced, and a certain balance is kept in the direction of the ship of state. It does not turn completely upside down,” Mr. Lee said. “The Americans take pride in having a system with checks and balances,” he added. “So, it is not so easy to do things, but it is not so easy to completely mess things up. ”",0

It seems that the U.S. military is geared up for a permanent cyber war with the people and various governments of this globe. 
Though tensions with Russia may have been temporarily alleviated with the election of Donald Trump – who has signaled for peace with Putin – the long game is much more complicated. 
With new powers in Washington taking shape in the next administration, one faction in government was quietly, subtly parading its power. 
The Continuity of Government contingent of the shadow government will not be taken out of power by any mere election, and no matter what decisions Trump makes and no matter what inflammatory remark he may make, there are those who will still have their finger on the button. And that means a tremendous amount of power. 
Residents in the Denver area were presented with a mysterious white plane that flew in a “racetrack pattern” for more than an hour above the city before it landed at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, where the aircraft – what the Navy has now disclosed to be an E-6B – is housed. 
Here’s the bizarre route that observers tracked, and the Navy was later forced to confirm: “Mysterious” plane circling over Denver was “just” an E-6B Mercury “doomsday” plane https://t.co/SqJlBkdIqg pic.twitter.com/oE0BBWrhFL

It’s mission remains classified, but military officials admit a drill was underway… 
via ABC 7 Denver : 
A plane shrouded in mystery captured the attention of thousands on Wednesday. Nobody knew why a high-altitude plane circled the City of Denver for hours. Now the Navy has some answers. 
Denver7 tracked IRON99 as it traveled from the West Coast to Oklahoma, where it eventually landed at Tinker Air Force Base, however it spent roughly an hour in Denver, circling in a racetrack-style holding pattern over the city. 
Denver7 branded it a mystery in a previous report because officials from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and a dozen Air Force Bases could not confirm what the flight may have been. 
A day later — after the plane landed — Navy officials… confirmed IRON99’s identity is a Navy E-6B Mercury, created by Boeing at a cost of $141.7 million per unit. 
The unit’s overall mission is classified, Hubbell said, [elaborating that] the E-6B is “command, control and communications abilities to direct and employ strategic resources.” 
[…] the planes are able to launch nuclear missiles and communicate with diverse assets, including nuclear submarines. 
[…] a high-ranking federal official … said the plane was involved in a classified training mission organized by the Department of Defense. 
The training mission reportedly centered around electronic surveillance and involved several agencies which aren’t likely to comment on the mission, the source said. 
Given that the E-6B deals with “command, control and communications,” as well as electronic surveillance and communications with nuclear submarines and other assets that could launch nuclear war… one can assume that a major mission is in rehearsal – to take charge of the nation’s vital weapons and resources in the event of a catastrophic emergency, break down in order or disabling of the power structure in Washington. 
A similar E-4B was spotted flying above the capital on the morning of September 11th, shortly after the attacks. It was reportedly conducting a drill, but later instructed to prepare to go active as a mobile command center. Both planes deal with sensitive electronics communications involving, at least in part, nuclear launch codes and military continuity in the event of a breakdown of order. 
DOOMSDAY PLANES It is important to note that the E-4B is no ordinary aircraft. It is a militarized version of a Boeing 747-200, equipped with advanced communications equipment, and capable of carrying a crew of up to 112 people. Nicknamed “Doomsday” planes during the Cold War, E-4Bs serve the president, the secretary of defense, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In times of national emergency, they can act as highly-survivable command, control, and communications centers to direct forces, execute war orders, and coordinate actions by civil authorities. The U.S. military possesses four of them in total. One is always kept on alert, with a full battle staff. Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska is the “Main Operating Base” for the E-4B, though there are also numerous “Forward Operating Bases” (FOB) throughout the U.S. [7] 
Here’s the reported layout of the E-6B, upgraded for the cutting edge of electronic warfare: 
In the current context, there are perhaps three distinct fronts that this command unit could have theater over. COMMUNICATIONS BLACKOUT – The E-6B’s communications and control powers could be used to disrupt or disable electronic communications in the population over a given city or area. With sensitive military installations near Colorado Springs, the plane could have blacked out much of the Denver area accordingly with the situation. This CoG plane has dominance over the civilian population, and can bring their ordinary activities to a halt. Surveillance, data collection and ‘drone detection’ may have also been objectives of this drill and real-life activities. CHECK AGAINST AGGRESSION – The E-6B’s capabilities are a powerful counterbalance to possible hostile intentions on the part of Russia, China or other adversaries. As SHTF has often highlighted, modern warfare is based around the use of electromagnetic fields, communications jamming and, potentially, the use of an EMP to knock out electronics. Depending upon the potential situation, the ranking U.S. official on board or in communication with this plane could launch nuclear weapons, communicate with SSBN submarines around the globe or deny airspace to a conflicting force. TRUMP CARD FOR THE COG – Symbolically, at least, the E-6B, conducting a drill a week or so after the election sends a message to the President-elect, and perhaps to his constituents as well, that there are limits to the power of a president. While Trump’s power is theoretically capped by the Constitution’s checks and balances, in the real world, the Continuity of Goverment (CoG) structure has operational superiority over any president, and perhaps they wanted to signal to Trump here (or perhaps not). If any president ‘gets out of line’ or starts to ‘believe they are truly in charge’, this plane can override their ego and maintain the dominance of the status quo… it is a potential coup in motion. 
This is the true face of the ruling elite. This is the system they maintain, and anything below this threshold is not truly in charge. 
This what democracy looks like, when you strip away the silly game of voting, candidates and campaigns. 
This is the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about.

Trump’s campaign has been frantic to close the huge gap in donations between Clinton’s and their own. By some estimates, Hillary is outspending Trump 7-to-1 in advertising – a steep hill to climb for a campaign that is already losing badly in nearly every battleground state. 
But in his desperation, Trump did something incredibly stupid. He promised his fans that he would “triple match” any donation over $75 that they made on October 1st. 
His fans, believing Trump would put his money where his mouth is, gave generously. Instead of make good on the promise, Trump donated squat. In fact, his donations for the entire month were less than he should have donated that very first day. On Oct 1, I got an email from Trump pledging to triple donations for 24 hrs. 
Donors gave $165,829 that day. 
Trump gave $30,682 all month.

Even for Trump’s diehard fans, this looks like the man is just the kind of grifter his critics have always claimed he was. Despite pretending to “self-fund” his campaign, Trump has chipped in hardly anything. He’s run his campaign much like he ran his charity, using other people’s money to promote himself. 
This is in stark contrast to Trump’s boasts. Famously, the candidate once said he was willing to spend upwards of one billion dollars on his campaign to be president. With just 11 days to go, Trump hasn’t even come close. Most estimates put his own contribution around $50 million – chump change for an alleged billionaire.

And it seems Trump’s campaign knows how badly he screwed this up. His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway scrambled to the nearest media outlet to proclaim that Trump would absolutely be fulfilling a promise he made to donate $100 million by the election. (Note again: He has just 11 days left to do so.) 
And then Trump himself reportedly wired $10 million to his campaign on Friday morning in a day late, dollar short desperation maneuver to help pull out of this tailspin. Donald Trump wired $10M of his own money into this presidential campaign this morning – Dow Jones

It’s hard to truly be surprised that Trump has been stingy with his own campaign. This is the “billionaire” who managed to pay no taxes in twenty years and donate almost no money to charity in the same period. He makes Scrooge McDuck look generous. And with less than two weeks to go, Trump’s chances of becoming president are looking about as fictional as the cartoon duck. 
Go home, Donald.

20467,20467,Mexicans Say They Will Build Trump Wall – Three Feet High,dailouk,"Home | World | Mexicans Say They Will Build Trump Wall – Three Feet High Mexicans Say They Will Build Trump Wall – Three Feet High By Eduardo Cojon 22/11/2016 11:46:05 
MEXICO CITY – Mexico – The Mexican government has agreed to Trump’s demands to build a wall along the U.S. border, and will start building as soon as Donald Trump is inaugurated as president in February 2017. 


Speaking from his presidential palace, Enrique Peña Nieto, revealed the Mexican plans to waiting journalists. 
“We have taken up the mantle to build the wall and will foot the cost as well. As agreed, the wall will go along the entire U.S. Mexico border.” 
Unbeknownst to Trump, he did not specify how tall the wall should be, and when he finds out the wall will only be three feet high, he is sure to hit the roof. 
“That is a minor detail we did not reveal to Señor Trump. The wall will be three feet high but it will fulfil our contract, and there is nothing the Don can do about it. Even an eight year old kid can jump over,” the Mexican president added.

20468,20468,Trump vs. Congress: Now What? - The New York Times,Robert Draper,"On Monday, Jan. 9, less than two weeks before President Trump’s inauguration, the House speaker, Paul Ryan, hosted a dinner at his office in the Capitol with members of Trump’s inner circle. The guests included the  ’s chief White House strategist, Stephen K. Bannon his    and family consigliere, Jared Kushner his chief of staff, Reince Priebus his economic adviser, Gary Cohn his nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin his incoming deputy chief of staff, Rick Dearborn and his   director, Marc Short. The ostensible purpose of the dinner was to discuss the details of Trump’s legislative agenda  —   in particular, the prospects for a sweeping   measure that Republicans, and especially Ryan, have been coveting for the past decade. It was hoped that the dinner could also establish some sort of common ground between Ryan and Bannon, the two figures who would arguably wield the greatest influence over how Trump’s campaign promises became law  —   or didn’t. Ryan was a fixture among establishment Republicans even before joining Mitt Romney’s presidential ticket in 2012, his previous labors on the House Budget Committee cementing his reputation as the    wizard of fiscal conservatism. Bannon, by contrast, was a renegade autodidact who read Plato and had seemingly materialized from nowhere to become the intellectual architect of Trump’s campaign and, later, administration. Up to this point, Ryan had epitomized to Bannon everything that was wrong with the Republican Party. Discussing the two parties’ shortcomings, Bannon later told me, “What’s that Dostoyevsky line: Happy families are all the same, but unhappy families are unhappy in their own unique ways?” (He meant Tolstoy.) “I think the Democrats are fundamentally afflicted with the inability to discuss and have an adult conversation about economics and jobs, because they’re too consumed by identity politics. And then the Republicans, it’s all this theoretical Cato Institute, Austrian economics, limited government  —   which just doesn’t have any depth to it. They’re not living in the real world. ” Breitbart News, the   media outlet Bannon ran before becoming the chief executive of the Trump campaign in August, had described Ryan, referring to his position on immigration, as “arguably the most   G. O. P. lawmaker in Congress”  —   an apostasy of nearly impeachable proportions from Bannon’s perspective. Worst of all, Ryan all but abandoned Trump during the 2016 campaign. After the leak in October of the damaging “Access Hollywood” tape, Ryan told fellow Republican House members on a conference call, “I am not going to defend Donald Trump  —   not now, not in the future. ” A Republican lawmaker on the call told Trump what Ryan had said, yet another reason for Bannon to regard himself as Ryan’s worst enemy. But as the dinner progressed, it became clear that Bannon and Ryan actually had some ideas in common. Over memorably bad chicken Parmesan, Ryan described his vision for a “  tax,” which would levy taxes on imports while offering exemptions for exports. His tax package would include “immediate expensing,” he explained, in which capital expenditures would be written off against profits in the first year rather than over time. It also would abolish the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax. These were ideas Ryan had been pushing since 2008. Now they had Bannon’s attention. Taken together with a drastic reduction in corporate taxes, Bannon believed, Ryan’s scheme would spur a renaissance of a   export economy, producing   labor in keeping with Trump’s populism. “I would actually say,” Bannon remembers observing admiringly, “that this tax reform comes as close to a first step of economic nationalism as there is. ” “I would call it ‘responsible nationalism,’’u2009” Ryan said, according to Bannon. Bannon laughed. “You’re going to have a lot of folks in the Senate say this is breathtakingly radical. ” He meant it as a compliment. To Bannon, the entire world order  —   from the two political parties to the Wall Street reliance on leveraging to multiculturalism  —   was undergoing an extraordinary realignment, one made manifest in the 2016 election. According to Bannon’s vision, economic nationalism would reorient priorities to the working class’s benefit. Trade deals, jobs programs, tax incentives, immigration restrictions, environmental deregulation and even foreign policy would ultimately serve to restore the primacy of those Trump called “the forgotten Americans. ” In March, when I spoke to Trump by phone, I asked him what the term “economic nationalism” meant to him. Compared with Bannon’s revolutionary fervor, his reply was surprisingly cautious. “Well, ‘nationalism’  —   I define it as people who love the country and want it to do good,” he said. “I don’t see ‘nationalism’ as a bad word. I see it as a very positive word. It doesn’t mean we won’t trade with other countries. ” Trump’s tone was genial but also a touch defensive. His postelection honeymoon had been short, if it existed at all. There were the administrative intrigues and   Twitter drama, along with the questions about his campaign’s contacts with Russia, which had already forced the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Still, Trump’s legislative liaisons and their counterparts on Capitol Hill were doggedly negotiating a rollout of the Trump Era, one that would fulfill his most significant campaign promises  —   those that could not be done with just a stroke of Trump’s own pen but required acts of Congress. First, Obamacare would be repealed and replaced. Next, an austere budget would be passed, with emergency funds allotted for the construction of a wall along the Southern border. Then would come a   plan, presumably of the type Ryan and Bannon discussed. And finally, a bipartisan coalition would deliver a   infrastructure plan to Trump’s desk. If all this came to pass by the end of 2017, it would lend some credence to Trump’s pledge that this would be “the busiest Congress we’ve had in decades. ” But by March, this timetable was looking like a formidable “if. ” Trump himself seemed prone to distraction as he spoke to me from the Oval Office. Though I was asking about his policy aims, his musings swerved off to other vexations. More than once he denounced as “fake news” reports about his administration’s supposed disharmony. He brought up his speech before the joint session of Congress in February, “which I hope you liked, but I certainly have gotten great reviews  —   even the people who hate me gave me the highest review. ” During the call, I could hear Priebus nearby, occasionally murmuring encouragement. Trump sounded more clipped and less jaunty on the call than he did during the discursive chats I had with him last year on the campaign trail. The business of governing had little to do with any trade he had previously practiced. In Congress, he was grappling with an arcane and famously inefficient ecosystem over which he had little if any control  —   and people he incessantly derided on the campaign trail as being “all talk and no action. ” I asked him if he still felt that way. “It’s like any other industry,” he replied, somewhat morosely. “I’ve met some great politicians and some, to be honest, who aren’t so hot. ” Trump wanted to make sure that he was given adequate credit for his achievements, even in his administration’s infancy. “We’ve only been here for a tiny speck of time,” he said, “and what I’ve done with regulations, moving jobs back into the country, what I’ve done with airplane pricing and buying is amazing. We’ve done a lot. I think we’ve done more than anybody for this short period of time. ” Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson would take exception to this claim. And Trump’s significant actions to date have consisted entirely of executive orders. What he has not yet demonstrated is his ability to actually shepherd a bill into law. The only major legislation that congressional committees have even seen thus far is a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, which met with a stunning rebuke from Trump’s own party, forcing Ryan to withdraw the measure on the afternoon of March 24. At this stage of his presidency, Barack Obama had already signed into law his $787 billion   package and had moved on to holding White House meetings on health care. It’s conceivable that Trump could hit Day 100 with only minor symbolic legislative achievements to his name. For him to avoid this ignominy, the 45th president will have to develop a rapport with Washington’s 535 federal deal makers, including the ones who “aren’t so hot. ” Whether Trump’s agenda succeeds will also depend in no small measure on the ability of Bannon to expand his game beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. At 63, and with a fortune reported to be in the tens of millions of dollars  —   partly through his investment in the company that owns the syndication rights to “Seinfeld”  —   Bannon is regarded by Trump as a peer in the way that, say, the    lifelong politico Priebus is not. He is also approvingly seen as a fellow workaholic by the president (whose only known hobbies are golf and   CNN). And he is a deft operator who has learned from the successes and failures of other Trump advisers. He has carefully not claimed credit that the president would wish for himself and avoids giving expansive interviews on his own controversial views that might detract from his boss’s celebrity. Like the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Bannon understands that power in Trump World derives mainly from close and sustained physical proximity to the boss. Unlike Lewandowski, Bannon immediately grasped the importance of maintaining close relations with Jared Kushner, who factored heavily in Lewandowski’s dismissal from the Trump campaign last summer. But like Kushner, Bannon has never worked in government or at a   institute and has no meaningful experience when it comes to getting legislation passed. On the Hill, he has a few random associations  —   Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative John Culberson of Texas among them. Otherwise, he remains a looming but indistinct presence to the lawmakers who will be needed to pass most of Trump’s agenda. Bannon’s interest in this agenda predated his association with Trump. One evening in January 2013, two guests showed up for dinner at the Capitol Hill townhouse that Bannon liked to call the Breitbart Embassy. One was the man Bannon would later describe to me as his “mentor”: Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama. The other was Sessions’s top aide and protégé, a jittery    named Stephen Miller. Two months earlier, Obama decisively defeated Mitt Romney in the presidential election, prompting Priebus, then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, to commission an analysis of the state of the party and its future, known colloquially in Washington as the “autopsy,” which would be delivered that spring. The only certainty was that the report would urge Republicans to court the growing Latino electorate  —   which had voted for Obama by a   margin that November  —   by championing comprehensive immigration reform. The three men at the dinner table that night were among the few Republicans in town who thoroughly rejected that conclusion. Bannon wanted to talk to Sessions and Miller about a different report: an article written by Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst for the website RealClearPolitics, titled “The Case of the Missing White Voters. ” Trende observed that Obama’s victory was less a function of increased minority turnout than of the fact that 6. 6 million white voters who participated in the 2008 election stayed home in 2012. The reason for this drop, Trende argued, was that white   voters who did not approve of Obama but were alienated by Romney’s perceived elitism had not voted. These votes were gettable, Bannon believed. As he would later tell me: “The working class, and in particular the lower middle class, understands something that’s so obvious  —   which is that they’ve basically underwritten the rise of China. Their jobs, their raises, their retirement accounts have all fueled the private equity and venture capital that built China. Because China’s really built on investments and exports, right? People are smart enough to know that they’re getting played by both political parties. The two may be different on social issues, but when it comes to fundamental economics, they’re both the same. That’s why the American working class is interested in trade. It’s linked to their lives. ” Sessions shared Bannon’s belief that the Republican Party needed to emphasize immigration reduction, border security and the preservation of   jobs through trade policy rather than courting Latino voters with a bill he regarded as “amnesty. ” As Sessions would write in a memorandum to his Republican colleagues six months later, “This humble and honest populism  —   in contrast to the administration’s cheap demagoguery  —   would open the ears of millions who have turned away from our party. ” At some point during the   dinner, Bannon recalls blurting out to Sessions, “We have to run you for president. ” Just two years earlier, in 2011, he made a similar pitch to Sarah Palin, after completing a documentary about her called “The Undefeated. ” Palin demurred. She was enjoying her life of celebrity and wealth, she had done little to immerse herself in policy minutiae and she was no doubt unsettled by Bannon’s warning that she stood little chance of defeating Obama. Now he delivered a similar message to Sessions. “Look, you’re not going to win,” he recalls saying. “But you can get the Republican nomination. And once you control the apparatus, you can make fundamental changes. Trade is No. 100 on the party’s list. You can make it No. 1. Immigration is No. 10. We can make it No. 2. ” Acknowledging that the drawling Alabama senator lacked Palin’s charisma, Bannon said, “You’ll be the  . ” But Sessions told Bannon he did not see himself running for president. “It was pretty obvious by the end of the night,” Bannon recalled, “that another candidate would have to do it. ” Two months later, on March 15, 2013, Bannon happened to be attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington when Trump took the stage. Trump had been a marginal figure at most in politics up to that point, entertaining a Reform Party run in the 2000 election  —   when he speculated that he would probably take more votes from the Democratic candidate than the Republican one  —   and leading a conspiratorial crusade in 2011 to force Obama to release his birth certificate. The possibility that he might be a suitable host body for Bannon’s worldview had not occurred to Bannon before Trump spoke. But Trump’s grousing references to China’s economic superiority, to 11 million “illegals” and to the erosion of America’s manufacturing sector were right out of Bannon’s playbook. From his desk in the Russell Senate Office Building, Stephen Miller, too, watched Trump’s speech. By 2014, Miller was sending emails to friends expressing the hope that Trump would run for president. By the time Trump announced his candidacy, in June 2015, Sessions was officially uncommitted but privately of the view that Trump was best suited to tap into the movement that he, Miller and Bannon discussed over dinner more than two years earlier. Bannon’s early support for Trump was manifest in Breitbart’s breathless coverage of his candidacy. In an email he sent on Aug. 30, 2015, to his former filmmaking partner Julia Jones, Bannon explained that while Republican candidates like Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina were “all great,” Trump represented a superior choice, because he “is a nationalist who embraces Senator Sessions’s plan” on immigration. Still, recalls Sam Nunberg, Trump’s first campaign strategist, “Steve kept all of his cards. ” He added: “He was respectful to some of the other ones who were running, like Walker and Cruz and Carson. He didn’t want to be seen as  . ” When Trump publicly disparaged John McCain’s   credentials, Bannon  —   himself a Navy veteran  —   called Nunberg and demanded that Trump issue an apology. (Trump did not.) Bannon was well positioned as a supportive but not sycophantic observer by Aug. 13, 2016, when the Trump donor Rebekah Mercer read with alarm a New York Times account of the Trump campaign’s inability to handle its mercurial candidate. At Mercer’s behest, Bannon (whose website Mercer’s family helped underwrite) and Kellyanne Conway (who at that point was receiving money from both a Mercer family political action committee and the Trump campaign) flew out that day to East Hampton, N. Y. where Trump was attending a dinner   at the home of the New York Jets’ owner, Woody Johnson. After the dinner, Bannon and Conway huddled with the candidate. Bannon remembers telling Trump, who at the time was trailing Hillary Clinton by double digits in the polls, “As long as you stick to the message”  —   by which he meant economic nationalism  —   “you have a 100 percent probability of winning. ” A week after the election, in an interview with the journalist Michael Wolff, Bannon offered a bold, sweeping sketch of what the vision might mean in policy terms: “Like [Andrew] Jackson’s populism, we’re going to build an entirely new political movement. It’s everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy. ” Of course, some of the conservatives Bannon intended to drive crazy possessed the congressional votes Bannon and Trump would need to advance this agenda. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a leading conservative in the House, told me in March, “I would argue that populism, as long as it’s rooted in conservative principle, is a darn good thing. ” Jordan was smiling as he said it, but the note of warning was hard to mistake. The last time the Republican Party controlled all branches of government in Washington was from 2003 to 2007. During that period, the United States military toppled Saddam Hussein, Congress delivered tax cuts for the wealthy and President George W. Bush appointed the reliably conservative jurist Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court. But in the collective view of conservatives, these years of the Bush presidency were mostly characterized by betrayal and disappointment. Goaded by Bush, congressional Republicans passed into law a new federal entitlement (prescription drugs for senior citizens, also known as Medicare Part D) ran up the deficit, promoted democratic ideals overseas in the feckless manner of Woodrow Wilson, considered a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and confirmed a Supreme Court chief justice, John G. Roberts Jr. whose swing vote would later save Obamacare from judicial evisceration. “My   line when I first ran in 2008 was, ‘Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House  —   and they blew it,’’u2009” Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told me. “Now we’ve got all three again, and I’m the guy who’s in Congress, not running for it. I don’t want to be in a position where we’re going to blow it one more time. ” Chaffetz and other House conservatives freely acknowledge that Trump is not cut from their cloth, but they say they could not care less as long as he gives them what they want. Selecting Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court seat once held by Justice Antonin Scalia was “the best thing the president did in his first 50 days,” Chaffetz told me. He and his conservative colleagues have been cheered by Trump’s recruitment of former House colleagues and conservative stalwarts like Vice President Mike Pence Tom Price, the health and human services secretary and Mick Mulvaney, the Office of Management and Budget director. When Chaffetz and I spoke in March, he had met with the president twice so far  —   access he considered “such a huge sea change” from the stony silence Republicans say they encountered from the Obama White House. Most important, the Trump agenda’s first three projected legislative moves  —   the Obamacare repeal and replacement, an austere budget and tax reform  —   were intended to keep conservatives happily in Trump’s camp. In turn, when the agenda moved on to less conservative items like infrastructure and trade agreements, Trump and Bannon would fully expect Republicans, including Ryan, to remember whose message resonated most with   voters last year. Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, is Trump’s chief point of contact on the Hill. When McCarthy was a college student and budding entrepreneur in Bakersfield, Calif. in the late 1980s, his girlfriend at the time, now his wife, Judy, gave him an autographed copy of Trump’s “The Art of the Deal. ” “I thought it was great,” he told me. In McCarthy’s view, Trump is a master of today’s media, much as Lincoln and Kennedy were in their own times. “He’s mastered instantaneous Twitter,” he said. “It’s like owning newspapers. ” Trump has found a kindred spirit in McCarthy, a coastal extrovert of ambiguous ideological portfolio who (unlike Ryan) would far rather talk about personalities than the tax code. And as the former minority leader in the California Legislature during the governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger, McCarthy is experienced in the care and feeding of celebrity egos. Since Trump’s nomination, the two have spoken frequently by phone  —   to date, Trump has never been known to directly email or text anyone  —   about the cast of 535 characters with whom the president must now deal. But in the end, what Trump needs from the majority leader is not gossip but votes  —   216 of them, to be exact, in the House. And McCarthy’s recent track record in obtaining majorities has not been the greatest. In his previous capacity as House whip, he was thwarted by members of his own party when it came to subjects as diverse as reauthorizing a Patriot Act they deemed too intrusive, a farm bill they considered too expensive and a   bill they regarded as too lenient. His most reliable obstacles have been the three dozen or so House conservatives known as the Freedom Caucus, a    group of fiscal  . Early this year, McCarthy predicted to me that the new president would quickly subjugate the Freedom Caucus. “Trump is strong in their districts,” McCarthy told me. “There’s not a place for them to survive in this world. ” When we spoke on the morning of March 7, Trump assured me that he would not bully the   bill’s loudest Republican critics, like the Freedom Caucus chairman, Representative Mark Meadows, on Twitter: “No, I don’t think I’ll have to,” he said. “Mark Meadows is a great guy and a friend of mine. I don’t think he’d ever disappoint me, or the party. I think he’s great. No, I would never call him out on Twitter. Some of the others, too. I don’t think we’ll need to. Now, they’re fighting for their turf, but I don’t think they’re going to be obstructionists. I spoke to Mark. He’s got some ideas. I think they’re very positive. ” But on March 21, in a meeting with the Freedom Caucus about the bill, Trump called out Meadows by name, saying, “I’m going to come after you, but I know I won’t have to, because I know you’ll vote ‘yes. ’’u2009” Meadows remained a “no” on the bill, and among conservatives, he was far from alone. One of the Freedom Caucus’s most outspoken members, Representative Raúl Labrador of Idaho, believes that the Trump White House was led astray by Ryan’s confidence that he knew what conservatives wanted when drafting the bill. “The legislation has to go through the body, not the top,” Labrador told me. “And if our leadership thinks now that we’re a unified body, that they can do things while ignoring us, that’s not going to happen. ” Labrador is an affable but decidedly stubborn    Mormon and former immigration lawyer who moved as a child with his single mother from Puerto Rico to Las Vegas. He was interviewed by the   for the post of interior secretary at Trump Tower last December  —   though Trump selected Labrador’s House colleague Ryan Zinke for the post a few days later. For now, Labrador and other Freedom Caucus members have been willing to blame House leaders like Ryan and McCarthy for drafting a health care bill that was not to conservatives’ liking. They aspire to remain philosophical whenever Trump’s daughter Ivanka persuades her father to propose initiatives like paid family leave, as he did during his   speech. “I didn’t stand up when he said that,” Labrador said. “That’s the only part of the speech where I thought, That’s not even close to what my party stands for. ” To House conservatives like Labrador, the Republican Party stands for limited government. To Trump and Bannon,   items like a border wall and infrastructure take priority over shrinking America’s debt. As Chaffetz admitted to me, “On the spending front, things could slip away really quickly. ” Trump’s budget blueprint is regarded by deficit hawks as fundamentally unserious, because it does not touch entitlements. Instead, it ravages perennial (and already  ) conservative piñatas like foreign aid, public broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts, in addition to downsizing the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department  —   cuts that focus on the 27 percent of the federal budget that is not mandatory spending or devoted to defense. And for all the Republicans’ chesty rhetoric on cuts like these over the years, as a top House Republican staff member told me, “even the cabinet secretaries at the E. P. A. and Interior are saying these cuts aren’t going to happen. They’re going to protect their grant programs, their payments to states, their Superfunds. So how do you cut 31 percent of the E. P. A. out of the 5 percent that isn’t protected? And a bill that cuts all money for the N. E. A. will not pass. For Republicans in the West”  —   states whose vast rural areas benefit disproportionately from N. E. A. grants  —   “that’s a   killer. The campaign commercials write themselves. ” Labrador says he would defend Trump’s cuts but doubts that many of his colleagues would. “What he’s going to learn is that members of Congress are unwilling to take the tough votes,” he told me. “When he learns that, what’s going to be the next step?” In Labrador’s view, Trump’s only sane recourse will be to accept the need for entitlement reform. “At some point, the reality of the budget is going to have to hit him,” he said. “You can have this economic nationalism  —   Bannon is very smart, he clearly helped him with his messaging, it was so successful  —   but at some point, that theory is going to hit reality. ” When I spoke with Trump, I ventured that, based on available evidence, it seemed as though conservatives probably shouldn’t hold their breath for the next four years expecting entitlement reform. Trump’s reply was immediate. “I think you’re right,” he said. In fact, Trump seemed much less animated by the subject of budget cuts than the subject of spending increases. “We’re also going to prime the pump,” he said. “You know what I mean by ‘prime the pump’? In order to get this”  —   the economy  —   “going, and going big league, and having the jobs coming in and the taxes that will be cut very substantially and the regulations that’ll be going, we’re going to have to prime the pump to some extent. In other words: Spend money to make a lot more money in the future. And that’ll happen. ” A clearer elucidation of Keynesian liberalism could not have been delivered by Obama. The one clear point of agreement between the Trump economic nationalists and the House conservatives is the one Ryan and Bannon identified over dinner in January: tax reform. But in so doing, they will be picking a fight that may prove perilous to Republicans. The    proposal that Ryan floated to Bannon has never been able to get past K Street lobbyists and wealthy Republican donors like the Koch brothers. When I asked Trump if he was a fan of the   tax, he replied: “I am. I’m the king of that. ” Almost no other country grafts an import tax onto a corporate tax, and it’s possible that enacting a   tax might well be in violation of the World Trade Organization’s agreements. Of course, Bannon has openly advocated abandoning the W. T. O. anyway, because of China’s membership in it. Still, the specter of new taxes on American corporations, higher prices for consumers and a jump in the dollar’s value may compel an unusual confederacy against the   plan. Labrador predicts that the   tax “will have very little political legs” in the conservative House, while Senator Lindsey Graham said in February that even in the   Senate, Ryan’s tax plan “won’t get 10 votes. ” Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat who has been outspoken in her willingness to work with Trump in spite of the broader stance of her party, says, “Let me tell you, I represent farmers, and anyone who tells me that farm country benefits from a high dollar needs to have a discussion with me. ” Perhaps the Republican faction most alarmed by Bannon’s economic nationalism is Washington’s military hawks. John McCain is among those not mollified by Trump’s pledge of enacting “one of the largest increases in   spending in American history. ” McCain scoffed when I brought this up to him. “Of course that’s simply not true,” he said. “When you look at 1981 and Reagan’s commitment to rebuilding the military, there’s no comparison to this 3 percent increase. It’s a shell game, my friend. ” Despite his obvious differences with Trump, McCain was willing to work with him  —   but Bannon’s presence seemed to confound such prospects. “It’s kind of interesting,” McCain said, “because I have decades of experience with Kelly, with Mattis, with Dan Coats, McMaster,” referring to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly Defense Secretary James Mattis Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence and H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser. “We discuss issues all the time. I think this is probably the finest   team that I’ve ever observed. It’s almost schizophrenic, in that I obviously don’t have conversations with Steve Bannon, but I do with Reince Priebus  —   he was my Republican chair in Wisconsin in my 2008 presidential campaign. So it’s almost a schizophrenic  —   that’s not the right word. A very divided kind of relationship. Paradoxical. ” McCain acknowledged to me that economic nationalism was a global movement and therefore not entirely “the making of some members of the Trump entourage. ” He then said: “But it is an articulation that I believe is strongly reminiscent of the 1930s. It certainly has unsettled our allies and friends around the world, there’s no doubt about that. ” Already, the senator asserted, the new administration’s bellicosity toward Mexico has increased the likelihood that its citizens will elect “a very     president. ” As for an import tax of the sort favored by Bannon and Ryan, “talk about harkening back to the 1930s,” he said. “It’s unbelievable to me that they somehow think if we start taxing goods coming across the border, that that’s somehow not going to be responded to by the Mexicans. Please. History shows this sort of action gets you into a trade war. ” Listening to McCain’s tirade, I found it evident that the Bannon Effect might well cost the Trump White House at least one Republican Senate vote on a number of central issues  —   this at a time when Republicans are clinging to a slender majority in the upper chamber. In such cases, Trump could find himself asking for something Obama was never able to count on: votes from the opposition. Early in the afternoon of Feb. 9, several Democratic senators met with Trump in the Roosevelt Room of the White House to discuss the Gorsuch nomination and other matters. Among them were Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana. All four are moderates who are up for   in 2018 in states Trump carried in 2016 by titanic margins  —   the least of which, in Donnelly’s state, was nearly 20 points. If Democrats are to nurture any hopes of retaking the Senate majority, they will need to hold these four seats. But if Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin and Tester need to be seen back home as willing to work with Trump, the president needs them as well. Republicans enjoy a precarious    advantage in the Senate. On matters like the Supreme Court, Trump can count on all 52. On votes requiring a simple majority, any two of those Republicans could fall away, and Pence could preserve the win with a tiebreaking vote. But a trio of fiscal   (like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Mike Lee) military hawks (John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio) or social moderates (Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Shelley Moore Capito) could deny Trump a majority, unless he could swing at least one Democrat to his side. That February afternoon in the Roosevelt Room, Donnelly thanked Trump for negotiating with Carrier, the manufacturing company based in Indiana that had threatened to move jobs to Mexico before Trump   it into keeping many of them in Indiana. But Donnelly urged him not to view that episode as a “ . ” He requested the president’s support for his End Outsourcing Act, which would give preferential treatment in awarding federal contracts to businesses that kept jobs in America. The words were scarcely out of Donnelly’s mouth before Trump said, “I’m 100 percent for that, and I’ll do everything I can to help get it passed. ” He then asked Pence, who was in the room, “What do you think, Mike?” Trump was apparently unaware that Pence, as the governor of Donnelly’s state, had refused to back the senator’s initiative, claiming instead that burdensome federal regulations were to blame for outsourcing. According to Donnelly, Pence gamely replied, “If it’s like what Joe describes, I’ll do everything I can to help. ” Donnelly, a   Irish Catholic with a barroom guffaw, had met Trump once before. In January 2011, he was among the   Blue Dog Coalition, composed of conservative House Democrats  —   what remained of them, anyway, after the previous November’s disastrous midterms  —   who traveled to New York for their annual retreat. At a hotel conference room in Midtown Manhattan, the 20 or so Blue Dogs received a procession of guests, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former President Bill Clinton. Only one of their scheduled appointments required that they go to their guest  —   and so they did, by bus, to Trump Tower. Trump greeted them in his boardroom, with its commanding view of Central Park. He was charming but also brash. “Remember, at that point he wasn’t really talking about running for office,” recalls one attendee, former Representative Dan Boren of Oklahoma. “But what strikes me was how he talked about the same issues  —   the wall, China  —   that became his stump speech years later. ” It was evident to the Blue Dogs that Trump was no Clinton or Bloomberg when it came to the issues. Says former Representative Ben Chandler of Kentucky, who was also in attendance: “The difference in terms of detailed knowledge of policy was stark. Trump just made bald assertions, really. ” Particularly memorable to Chandler was Trump’s insistence “that one of the best things the country could do was slap a massive tariff on the Chinese. ” Chandler continued: “He seemed not to understand that this would probably cause the entire world economy to melt down by causing a huge trade war. What I remember more than anything else was our general reaction afterward. And it was one of disbelief. ” Today Donnelly remains offended by what he calls Trump’s “crazy stuff,” as well as the alternative to Obamacare that Trump supported. But he does not begrudge Trump his showmanship. “He came to the Carrier plant,” Donnelly said. “I’ve been working on that issue since Day 1. I was begging people in the Obama administration to come out and talk to our workers. Donald Trump came out there. And Donald Trump talked to our workers. You can tell people you care. But it matters if you show up. ” The Senate Democrat who, to outward appearances, seems closest to Trump is Joe Manchin, who met face to face with the   in Trump Tower in December. Before the meeting, Bannon took the West Virginia senator aside. “The thing you need to know about Trump,” Bannon said, “is he doesn’t care about the Republican Party and he doesn’t care about the Democratic Party. He just wants to put some wins on the board for the country. ” In the meeting, Trump asked Manchin what could be done for coal miners. Manchin replied that he should support his Miners Protection Act, which would secure health benefits and pension funds for retired miners. According to Manchin, Trump replied that he would thoroughly support such a measure. Later that month, Manchin went on “Morning Joe”  —   the one show on MSNBC that Trump has been known to watch  —   to discuss, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the Newtown school massacre, the need to expand background checks on gun purchases. Within an hour after Manchin was offscreen, his cellphone rang. It was Trump. Manchin was not completely forthcoming about the conversation, but he did tell me that he envisioned “a complete opportunity” for new   legislation. Unlike with Obama, he said, “no one thinks President Trump would do anything that would take away your gun rights. ” In his conversations with Manchin and Donnelly, Trump was essentially throwing his support behind a Democratic initiative without first checking with the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to ask what he thought of those proposals. Had he done so, the answer in each case would have been: not much. (Though on the coal miners’ legislation, Manchin said: “We’re seeing Mitch McConnell go from a ‘No, no and hell no’ to now dropping his own bill. Which is fine, so long as we get it. ”) Still, Trump may have little choice but to indulge Democrats on some of their pet issues, given that he will need their votes on two of the most critical pieces of his agenda: infrastructure and trade deals. Until now, Trump has divulged few details about this   infrastructure venture. On the campaign trail, he frequently cited America’s crumbling roads and bridges. He bemoaned the potholes defiling the runways at La Guardia Airport, where he parked his two planes. During Donnelly’s visit with Trump in the Roosevelt Room, the president “talked about the   Tunnel with the tiles falling off, which he would see on his way to La Guardia,” Donnelly recalled. (The Metropolitan Transportation Authority denies that tiles are falling off the tunnel.) When I asked Trump for more specifics, he gingerly offered a few morsels: “This is something that’s going to be a real infrastructure bill, where real work is going to be done on bridges and roads and airports and things that we’re supposed to be doing. So it’s not just a political piece of paper. We’re going to do infrastructure, and it’s going to be a very big thing. ” Trump’s description struck me as uncharacteristically modest. Bannon had evoked a more gleaming vision when he told me: “Look, economic nationalism is predicated on a     infrastructure for the country, right? Broadband as good as Korea. Airports as good as China. Roads as good as Germany. A rail system as good as France. If you’re going to be a   power, you’ve got to have a   infrastructure. ” When I asked the president if his initiative might include such features, he replied: “Yes. It could, it could. You look at Japan and China, where they have the fast trains, and we don’t have any. You look at other countries where we used to be the leader, and now we’re the laggard. It’s not going to happen anymore. ” What also may not happen is House Republicans’ supporting a   bill that is at least somewhat reminiscent of the stimulus bill they unanimously opposed eight years ago. It’s also possible that even moderate Democrats in swing states may face pressure not to come to Trump’s rescue. After all, the president remains intensely unpopular among Democrats, who continue to nurture hopes that Trump is one Russia connection away from impeachment. As a senior White House official told me of Gorsuch’s nomination to the Supreme Court: “The comment we often get from Democrats is, ‘That’s a great nominee.’ Oh, so you’re voting for him? ‘I can’t.’ Why not? ‘My base would go crazy, and I’d be primaried.’ That environment has to change before we can have any of these conversations. ” On the morning of Feb. 2, two Democratic leaders on trade issues, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts  —   the ranking members of the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees  —   met with Trump, along with a few of his advisers and Republican lawmakers. Trump had already greeted the day by threatening to yank federal funding from the University of California at Berkeley after acts of violence had forced the cancellation of the Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos’s speech on campus, and by taunting Arnold Schwarzenegger’s poor ratings on “The Apprentice” during the National Prayer Breakfast. Disquiet lingered from Trump’s travel ban on refugees and his surly phone conversation with the Australian prime minister the previous week. Amid this chaos  —   entirely to Bannon’s liking and grating to nearly everyone else in Washington  —   actual legislative activity was slowly unfolding. Trump began the meeting by condemning the trade deals negotiated by his predecessors. The press pool was then ushered out before the Democrats could say anything in front of the cameras. When Neal was given a chance to speak, he informed Trump, Pence, Bannon, Kushner and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that America had in fact prospered as a result of past trade deals. Neal emphasized the crucial role that the Panama Canal played in the economic vitality of the Eastern Seaboard. Other than Ross, no one on Trump’s team seemed aware of this. “They were a bit surprised,” Neal later told me. He was also struck by the White House’s abhorrence of multilateral pacts, which seemed to him to be naïve. “The idea that you’re going to negotiate 148 bilateral agreements with W. T. O. members does not seem realistic,” Neal said. “The idea that we’re all of a sudden going to have a   agreement with Great Britain, that’s going to take years to do. ” Later, Neal said, Ross privately assured him that the Trump administration “would not give up on multilateral deals. ” Neal’s lecture signified the start of what is likely to be a long and at times contentious reckoning on the part of Trump and Bannon with the limits of their nationalist rhetoric. Of all the legislative lifts, none will be heavier than renegotiating trade agreements, which require a simple majority approval by both the Senate and the House. Scrounging up 15 Democratic senators who are willing to vote along with 52 Republicans would be a formidable enough task on any issue. But just as Democrats like Neal in the Northeast would fight for a trade deal that benefits their region, so will Republican lawmakers along the Southern border rebel at an effort to repeal Nafta. As McCain told me, “If you negated Nafta, it would send my state into a severe recession. ” He assured me that Trump’s nationalist posture would not provoke only regional opposition. He conjured up another Republican era  —   not Reagan’s, not Bush’s, but instead that of Herbert Hoover, when two Republican lawmakers joined with a Republican president to design a protectionist initiative that ultimately caused American exports to plummet during the Great Depression. “Somewhere,” McCain said with a dark chuckle, “Mr. Smoot and Mr. Hawley are smiling. ” On Thursday, March 23, Trump hosted a morning meeting of Freedom Caucus holdouts in the Cabinet Room. Jeff Duncan, a congressman from South Carolina who was present, told me that Trump told them: “I need you guys. We need to put up a win. It’s not just about needing to repeal Obamacare  —   though we do. It’s also that a win here sets up a win for tax reform and gives us momentum going into infrastructure. And if the bill fails, it could derail all of that. ” With customary bravado, Trump told the conservative members that he didn’t want to squeak by with just a   victory. “I want all 237 of you,” he said, according to Duncan, referring to the entire House Republican conference. That included the more moderate members, who had told Trump they felt that the White House wasn’t paying sufficient attention to their concerns. Later in the day, Trump hosted another meeting with the moderates, where Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania informed Trump that he remained a “no. ” According to an attendee, Trump angrily informed Dent that he was “destroying the Republican Party” and “was going to take down tax reform  —   and I’m going to blame you. ” Until that day, Duncan had been an unyielding “no” on the bill. The previous week, he delivered an impassioned speech to the vice president and other Republicans, insisting that this vote constituted “our generation’s rendezvous with destiny  —   a real chance to roll back the size and scope of the federal government, returning some liberty back to the people through our actions to repeal Obamacare. ” In a text to me, Duncan pointed to history: “39 men in a hot room in 1787 had the courage to break from the norm and empower a nation. ” But now the   congressman was, for the first time in his life, sitting across the table from a president who was personally appealing for his support. The White House was offering concessions and agreeing to them in writing. Duncan left the meeting and spent a few hours pondering, as he would later put it, “the greater opportunity we as Republicans have. ” By that evening, Trump had won Jeff Duncan’s vote. It wasn’t enough. The next afternoon, Ryan pulled the House health care bill, conceding that neither he nor the White House could muster enough votes. “You get about nine months to do the big things,” Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader, told me at the beginning of the year. Nine months seemed like a long time then, the calendar spacious and the legislative   possibilities plentiful. But more than two of those months are gone already  —   and the path to future wins, as Trump foresaw in his meeting with the Freedom Caucus, is now more complicated. When he took office, Trump relished the prospect of becoming a new kind of deal maker in the White House. By the time I spoke with him in early March, however, he already seemed to be taking stock of the limits to his powers. He still saw himself as the closer in chief  —   but then that was “typical, I would think, of a president,” he mused. “Some more than others. ”",0
20469,20469,’Refuse Fascism’ Group Behind Berkeley Riot Received $50k from George Soros - Breitbart,Charlie Nash,"One of the   “ ” groups behind last week’s riot in Berkeley, Refuse Fascism, received $50, 000 from a group backed by socialist billionaire George Soros, according to the Daily Caller. [The Alliance for Global Justice, which is funded by the George   Tides Foundation, reportedly donated $50, 000 to fund Refuse Fascism, which openly brags about using violence to shut down conservative and libertarian speech.  “While it is unclear whether those who carried out the violence were paid to do so, the benefactors of the Alliance for Global Justice  —   and Refuse Fascism  —   are listed online,” reported the Daily Caller. “According to its most recent 990 tax form, Alliance for Global Justice (AfGJ) received $2. 2 million in funding for the fiscal year ending in March 2016. One of the group’s biggest donors is the Tides Foundation, a   funded by billionaire progressive philanthropist George Soros. Tides gave AfGJ $50, 000. ” “Other notable donors include the city of Tucson and the United Steel Workers labor union. The former gave $10, 000 to AfGJ while the latter contributed $5, 000,” they continued. “Charities associated with several major corporations also donated. Patagonia. org, the outdoor apparel and equipment company, gave $40, 000. The Ben  Jerry Foundation, the charity associated with the ice cream maker, gave $20, 000. And Lush Cosmetic gave $43, 950. Another bit of irony is seen in the $5, 000 contribution from the Peace Development Fund, a group that claims to support organizations that fight for human rights and social justice. ” The group defended the violent riot at Berkeley on Facebook, which left numerous Trump supporters and fans of MILO injured and bloody, before deleting their post. “Dismantling police fences is not violent,” they claimed, according to the Daily Caller, ignoring the rest of the violence that occured. “And to compare preventing someone like that from speaking to the   violence that they perpetuate everyday is ludicrous. ” Refuse Fascism also branded the riot as “righteous,” and encouraged more violence to shut down conservatives in a post on their website. “Last night, thousands of students, professors and others protested the appearance and organizing rally of Milo Yiannopoulos, a major fascist operative, shutting it down. This was righteous and much more like this is needed,” the group proclaimed. “Lets be clear: Milo Yiannopoulos is not engaging in ‘free speech.’ He is consciously spearheading the Nazification of the American University. ” The riot started at UC Berkeley on Wednesday after protesters against Breitbart Senior Editor MILO became increasingly violent outside of his show. “ ” started several fires, smashed windows and ATMs, looted downtown stores, attacked cars, and assaulted dozens of MILO fans, male and female, who they falsely accused of being “Nazis. ” Despite the large amount of violence, numerous reports indicate that police officers refused to intervene, and only one suspect was arrested. UFC veteran and professional MMA fighter Jake Shields was even forced to rescue a man who was being assaulted by   rioters after police allegedly refused to intervene. “Like fifteen people were trying to attack him and others were cheering them on,” explained Shields, who managed to successfully rescue the man, in an interview with Breitbart News. “No one helped, no one had the balls to step in, so my reaction was to run in and start picking people off. ” “More chaos started happening, so I went up to the police and tried bringing them back, but they were just like ‘we’re not really going over there. You should just stay away. ’” he continued. “I don’t know if they were taking orders from someone or if they were just being lazy. I don’t know what the situation was, but it was pathetic to watch.

It’s a sad scene that they would allow that. ” The national   for the Alliance for Global Justice, Chuck Kaufman, claimed he wasn’t aware that Refuse Fascism were involved in the riots, but defended their involvement citing the fact that numerous   groups joined in. “I wasn’t aware that Refuse Fascism was involved, but probably they were one of a whole lot of groups calling to shut down Milo Yiannopoulos’ hate speech,” said Kaufman to The Daily Caller. “AfGJ acts as fiscal sponsor for Refuse Fascism which means we process   donations for them. As long as their use of the money falls into areas permitted for   501( c)(3) organizations, we don’t involve ourselves one way or the other in their program work. ” Several celebrities and news outlets expressed support for the riot, including Hollywood director Judd Apatow, who deleted his tweet shortly after, and Fusion, who smeared MILO as a “Nazi,” before praising rioters. The day after, MILO’s tour bus was tracked down by “ ” and vandalized, forcing both him and his team to evacuate the premises after his location was leaked online.

20470,20470,Liberals Setting Up a Pass on Colin Kapernick’s NFL Free Agency as Evidence of ’Racism’ - Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,"As more members of the media discover that San Francisco 49ers   quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s free agency is going ignored by the NFL, many are pegging his failure an example of “racism. ”[Kaepernick became the subject of both praise and condemnation last season with his   protests, by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem at the start of each game. After the season, the quarterback declared his free agency but with the announcement also announced an abrupt end to his refusal to stand for the anthem. But, with the league’s free agents signing to teams at a quickening pace, Kaepernick has thus far gone unsigned.  Only last week, Bleacher Report’s Mike Freeman took a look at Kaepernick’s inability to find a new team and noted that many executives don’t want his type of disruption in their locker rooms. Over the weekend, a Fox News article revealed that “70 percent of NFL managers genuinely hate” Colin Kaepernick. Many reasons have been listed. Some analysts criticize Kaepernick’s throwing accuracy, others think he isn’t much of a team player because he is a moody loner, and still others say he seems out of his depth when asked to learn new plays and plans. Rumors circled early in the season that Kaepernick only began his protests to raise his profile as a race activist to head off being traded by the 49ers. This rumor charged that Kaepernick meant use his activism as a weapon against the team, so that in case they tried to trade him he could claim racism. And in that vein, it appears that some in the media fell right into line with that tactic. TV One host and former CNN personality Roland Martin is a case in point. Martin made just that very charge in a March 17 tweet. If not a single @NFL team signs @Kaepernick7, it shows their hatred of a Black man taking a social stand.

20471,20471,Hacker Claims To Have Stolen These Controversial Photos From NASA,Eddy Lavine,"posted by Eddie The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has always been at the frontier of science and technology. Since 1958, NASA has done its best to allow humankind to know more about life and the universe. Thanks to this space agency, people have been able to walk on the moon. In the near future, we might even have people walking on Mars. NASA will be moving farther into the unknown areas of the Universe. I know that many of us are hoping to find life beyond the earth. But what if NASA is already aware of alien life ? Well, one hacker claims to have found NASA’s secret photos for all the world to see. Read on! 1. Is that a massive wheel from an extinct civilization? This could have possibly been a part of a huge machine. 2. The side of this cliff has been charred. This shouldn’t look like this if this portion was a representation of what occurred thousands of years ago. Is this because of extraterrestrial activity? 3. This metal vault was hidden in ice for so long. I want to know what’s inside this mysterious container! 4. Is this place from another planet? If you look closely, the area beyond shows a structure that doesn’t look like anything on the earth. 5. These golden bricks hide an unknown language. Sadly, no one has been able to decipher what these writings mean. 6. What were all those military ships doing there? Either they were observing a supernatural phenomenon, or they were trying a new military weapon. 7. Did NASA hide this asteroid impact from the public? If they did, they must have good reason to keep it away from everyone else. Did they witness extraterrestrial life? 8. Those holes don’t look natural at all. The circles are almost the same, and the placement is strange. It looks like a place where machines are hidden and deployed. 9. Using night vision, NASA supposedly captured an unknown structure. It looks like a pyramid, but it is not visible using normal cameras. 10. Was this huge skeleton a part of the Anunnaki? The Anunnaki was known in Mesopotamia as a group of Gods. 11. Large human beings probably existed at some point. However, why can’t scientists find something like this today? This creature might have been an alien that looks like a human. 12. I found this image incredibly terrifying! If this is true, then NASA has evidence of extraterrestrial life. That obviously looks like a spaceship. 13. A temple was found underneath the ocean.

20473,20473,Mark Ruffalo Just Did Something Amazing For Protesters Fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline,Tom Cahill,"27444 SHARES 
The Standing Rock Sioux’s camp, set up to physically stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, just got solar power thanks to Mark Ruffalo. 
The actor and director delivered trailers full of solar panels alongside Wahleah Johns, founder of Native Renewables, to the Standing Rock camp. As cold weather begins to set in for the indigenous tribes facing off with oil companies in North Dakota, the solar panels will help generate electricity to provide the camp with life-sustaining heat and medical treatment. 
EcoWatch reported that Ruffalo and Johns touted the necessity of switching to renewable energy in the wake of drastic climate change. Ruffalo also emphasized the right of Native Americans to protect their land from predatory fossil fuel companies. 
“Around the world, more than 80 percent of the forests and lands with protected waterways and rich biodiversity are held by indigenous tribes. This is no coincidence,” Ruffalo said. “As so many of us suffer from polluted water, air and land in our rural and urban communities, the water defenders at Standing Rock are showing us another way.” 
However, Ruffalo was quick to note that he was merely “trying to be of service” in using his platform to bring awareness to the Dakota Access Pipeline protest. 
“It was really Wahleah Johns responsible for the delivery. I was there to draw the spotlight,” Ruffalo told US Uncut in an email. 
Johns, whose company’s goal is to provide low-cost, renewable energy sources and green energy jobs for indigenous communities, praised the Standing Rock Sioux’s fight against Energy Transfer Partners’ pipeline, calling it necessary for the sake of the planet’s survival. 
“Water is life,” said Johns , who is a leader in the Navajo nation. “By leading a transition to energy that is powered by the sun, the wind, and water, we ensure a better future for all of our people and for future generations.” 
The Dakota Access Pipeline, if constructed, would carry highly toxic tar sands oil through North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois , where it would then be transported by train to ports on the Gulf of Mexico. Sacred land belonging to indigenous communities in North Dakota was destroyed for the pipeline route, with Native American leaders saying they were never consulted about the pipeline before construction began. The Standing Rock Sioux, who call themselves “water protectors,” say the pipeline would endanger drinking water for millions of people along the pipeline route.

20474,20474,Study: More Vitamin B In Mother’s Diet Reduces Risk Of Colon Cancer In Offspring,Dr. Edward F. Group III,"in: General Health (image: shutterstock) Few experts question the influence a mother’s diet can have on her children’s long term physical health. Yet, many believe this effect is mostly sociological, limited to positive or negative role modeling, and the development of general dietary habits later in life. However, research suggests that the foods moms eat could impact the health of their children much more directly. Scientists at Tufts University’s USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (USDA HNRCA), near Boston, have published findings of a study which shows a strong connection between the quantity of B vitamins pregnant mice consume and the likelihood of their offspring developing colorectal cancer as adults [ 1 ] . Breaking Down The Study Three test groups of pregnant and nursing mice, which were genetically engineered to be predisposed to develop colorectal cancer, were fed diets with either higher than normal, adequate, or slightly deficient amounts of folate and vitamins B2, B6, and B12. Once fully weened, all newborn mice were fed identical, nutritionally balanced diets through adulthood. The occurrence of tumor development appeared similar between both the adequate and B vitamin deficient groups, with about 60 percent of the mice in each of these two groups eventually developing colon cancer . In comparison, less than 20 percent of the mice in the group that was given larger than normal servings of B vitamins were found to have malignant growths. While these figures are impressive, the researchers caution that the study itself is only a preliminary investigation, and additional studies will be needed to further assess the correlation between maternal vitamin B consumption and reduced risk of cancer in humans. 
Dr. Jimmy Crott, PhD, lead author of the HNRCA study: 
“We saw, by far, the fewest intestinal tumors in the offspring of mothers consuming the supplemented diet. Although the tumor incidence was similar between offspring of deficient and adequate mothers, 54% of tumors in the deficient offspring were advanced and had invaded surrounding tissue while only 18% of tumors in the offspring of adequate mothers displayed these aggressive properties.” Most healthcare providers already recommend higher than normal intake of folate and other essential B vitamins during pregnancy and while nursing as part of routine prenatal care. And accordingly, most popular brands of prenatal vitamins> contain significantly larger than normal serving of all four B vitamins as compared to regular multivitamins. The standard reasons for this, however, have nothing to do with with the prevention of colon cancer. In addition to their potential for the risk of colorectal cancer, Vitamin B – folate, more specifically – has long been known to play an important role in the prevention of spina bifida and related defects of the neural tube (a sort of embryonic forerunner of the central nervous system) during fetal gestation. It’s also believed to have a strong influence on proper neurological development in very young children. References:",1
20475,20475,"Daily Mail Compares 2 U.K. Leaders — Their Legs, Not Their Ideas - The New York Times",Sewell Chan,"LONDON  —   Britain’s prime minister and Scotland’s leader met on Monday to discuss the most consequential of questions: Will Britain’s departure from the European Union cause Scotland  —   joined with England since 1707  —   to leave the United Kingdom? But for The Daily Mail, one of Britain’s most popular newspapers, the question that mattered was: Which leader had better legs? “Never mind Brexit, who won  !” its cover on Tuesday blared. Many readers were appalled that the encounter between Theresa May, the prime minister, and Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, had been reduced to a comparison of their bodies. By Tuesday afternoon, at least one complaint had been filed with Britain’s press regulator. “This is 2017,” Chuka Umunna, a Labour lawmaker, wrote on Twitter. “Sexist does not begin to describe this front page. ” Others, perhaps more jaded, were unsurprised, given how The Daily Mail has represented women in its pages in the past. “The Daily Mail do this regularly,” said Roy Greenslade, a professor of journalism at City University in London and a columnist for the liberal newspaper The Guardian. “And this is a particularly venal example, but if you look at it day on day, there are plenty of similar examples. ” Professor Greenslade said the blatant sexism was done unapologetically, “with a sense of confidence on the understanding that they can’t see what the fuss is all about. ” Mrs. May and Ms. Sturgeon met at a hotel in Glasgow on Monday, two days before the British government was set to invoke Article 50, formally notifying the European Union of Britain’s intention to leave the bloc. The leaders stopped for a photograph, sitting next to each other in armchairs. “But what stands out here are the legs  —   and the vast expanse on show,” Sarah Vine, the author of the Daily Mail article, wrote. Ms. Vine is married to Michael Gove, the British politician who helped lead the campaign to leave the European Union. The article went on to describe each woman’s stance. “Knees tightly together,” Mrs. May opted for “a studied pose that reminds us that for all her confidence, she is ever the vicar’s daughter,” the article said. Ms. Sturgeon’s legs, described as “undeniably more shapely shanks,” were “more flirty, tantalizingly crossed. ” The writer then called the Scottish leader’s posture “a direct attempt at seduction: Her stiletto is not quite dangling off her foot, but it could be. ” The Daily Mail has a readership of about 3. 4 million. It has often portrayed what it calls “career women” through the lens of their appearance, rather than through their accomplishments. “Even though they are great champions of Theresa May  —   and were champions of Mrs. Thatcher  —   they still basically see women in a 1950s role, as an adornment,” Professor Greenslade said, referring to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. “That’s why so much of their editorial is about how women look. ” In 2014, for example, The Daily Mail compiled photographs of female lawmakers entering or leaving 10 Downing Street, the prime minister’s office and residence, during meetings about a cabinet reshuffle by David Cameron, Mrs. May’s predecessor. The article, with the headline “Esther, the Queen of the Downing Street Catwalk,” referring to one of the lawmakers, Esther McVey, also caused an uproar. To the latest criticism, The Daily Mail issued the response “For goodness sake, get a life!” Its statement called the article “a sidebar alongside a serious political story” that appeared “in an   paper packed with important news and analysis. ” The statement added that the newspaper had backed Mrs. May when she ran to succeed Mr. Cameron as leader of the governing Conservative Party. The newspaper added that it had often commented on the appearance of politicians, including “Mr. Cameron’s waistline” the hair of the former chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne and the attire of Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party. If the statement reflected a certain sensitivity to the negative coverage, so did later versions of the front page. Observers noted that it was tweaked in print, for a later edition, to add the words: “Sarah Vine’s lighthearted verdict on the big showdown. ” Some critics said that the adjustment was itself sexist, as it appeared to shift attention to the writer. “I think people maybe have had a slight sense of humor failure,” said Ms. Vine, speaking on the BBC radio show “World at One. ” “What we’re doing is creating a more approachable version of the story,” she added. Ms. Vine also defended the cover change, saying she stood by what she had written. Professor Greenslade saw the late change in the cover language as a belated attempt to   a controversy. “It is a pretty pathetic excuse,” he said. “When you see that front page, it’s quite clear what they meant: Don’t worry about the politics, just look at the legs. ”",0
20476,20476,James Comey Hearing Destroys Obstruction of Justice Case Against Trump - Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,"Former FBI director James Comey began his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by suggesting that the question of whether President Donald Trump had committed obstruction of justice was one for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate. [But under questioning by Sen. James Risch ( ) Comey all but destroyed any hope Democrats had for bringing a case of obstruction of justice against President Donald Trump.  Their exchange was as follows: Risch: I want to drill right down, as my time is limited, to the most recent   regarding, allegations that the President of the United States obstructed justice. And, boy, you nailed this down on page page five, paragraph three, you put this in quotes. Words matter, you wrote down the words so we can all have the words in front of us now. There’s 28 words that are in quotes, and it says, quote: “I hope”  —   this is the president speaking  —   “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. ” Now, those are his exact words is that correct? Comey: Correct. Risch: And you wrote them here and you put them in quotes. Comey: Correct. Risch: Thank you for that. He did not direct you to let it go. Comey: Not in his words, no. Risch: He did not order you to let it go. Comey: Again, those words are not in order. Risch: No. He said, “I hope. ” Now, like me, you probably did hundreds of cases, maybe thousands of cases, charging people with criminal offenses. And of course you have knowledge of the thousands of cases out there where people have been charged. Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice or for that matter any other criminal offense where they said or thought they hoped for an outcome? Comey: I don’t know well enough to answer. And the reason I keep saying his words is, I took it as a direction. Risch: Right. Comey: I mean, it’s the President of the United States with me alone, saying, “I hope this. ” I took it as this is what he wants me to do. I didn’t obey that, but that’s the way I took it. Risch: You may have taken it as a direction, but that’s not what he said. Comey: Correct. Risch: He said, “I hope. ” Comey: Those are exact words, correct. Risch: You don’t know of anyone that’s been charged for hoping something? Comey: I don’t, as I sit here. Risch: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Democrats have hinged their hopes for impeachment  —   and reversing the 2016 elections  —   on the idea that Trump committed obstruction of justice. That case has now been smashed beyond repair.

WASHINGTON (Sputnik) — The 2016 election will be the first held without the full protections afforded by the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which the US Supreme Court invalidated in 2013.

Republican nominee Donald Trump has claimed the election is rigged and called for his supporters, including police and sheriffs, to independently patrol polling places for voter fraud, sparking at least some concerns that minority voters could be subject to intimidation. 
Trump, but also numerous other critics , have warned of mass voter fraud in light of the fact that no mechanism exists to verify individuals are legally entitled to vote or keep people from voting more than once. Moreover, critics have raised the issue of names of dead people being included on voter lists as well as voting machines being highly vulnerable to manipulation and hacking.

20478,20478,5 DIY Survival Tools To Make From Scratch,Chris Black,"Chris Black November 21, 2016 5 DIY Survival Tools To Make From Scratch 
Let’s begin today’s article with a question: do you know what homo sapiens means? Well, I bet you do. But then again, how about homo faber? What’s the relation between homo sapiens and homo faber? 
Translated literally, homo faber means “man, the maker.” 
To put it simply, let’s assume that dolphins are very intelligent creatures since that’s what I hear constantly on National Geo and the Discovery Channel. 
But that intelligence doesn’t help them much; they’re just the same as they were 500,000 years ago. Cute, intelligent creatures that constantly get caught in our fishing nets (by mistake) and they can’t get out. They often end up in tuna cans (that’s why I never eat tuna, but I’m digressing). 
Are you starting to get the picture? 
Homo faber is a peculiar creature, and I mean us, the people, the only “animals” on the planet which are able to control their environment through the use of – you guessed it – tools. Okay, tools and a juicy brain-to-body ratio. Some say that we control our fate too with those same tools , but I have my doubts about that. 
Regardless of what you’re thinking about your fate or the lack thereof, tools are pretty cool to have, especially in a survival situation . But then again, tools aren’t necessarily defined by what you can buy for $3.99 in your local hardware store. 
Actually, some while ago, I saw an octopus on TV that was using a small rock to break a clam’s shell. By most accounts, octopuses are pretty stupid compared to humans. 
The idea is that when confronted with an outdoors survival scenario, you can improvise tools from scratch, thus living to fight another day. If an octopus can do it, so can you, right? 
So, if early humans were able to manufacture tools using first animal bones, then stones, then metal and then via 3D printing, what’s there to stop you from learning from your ancestors? 
Now that you have the general idea, let’s see about a few primitive-technology ideas which may very well save your life someday, or at least improve the quality of life for you and your family in a survival scenario, which is the next best thing. 
1. How to build a fresh water prawn trap from scratch 
The idea is very simple and straightforward: one must eat in order to stay alive. So, with the prawn trap you can catch prawns and eat them. The trap is very easy to build using lawyer cane, vine, and sticks. Prawn/fish traps are very easy DIY traps which can successfully be used to catch aquatic life thanks to their peculiar shape. 
Basically, you’ll have to build a simple basket with an entrance designed in a funnel-like fashion so that the prawn will get funneled in, but it will not be able to get out. Here’s the detailed video tutorial about the DIY-ing job itself. Video first seen on Primitive Technology . 
The trap must be placed under some tree roots or something similar in the water and it doesn’t require bait, as curiosity kills the cat … err, prawns. You’ll require a little bit of basketry practice but if you’re into outdoor survival, learning this skill may prove very useful some day for many different tasks. 
2. How to make a survival spear from scratch 
Spears were among the first hunting/ self defense weapons used by mankind and this video tutorial will teach you how to make your own survival spear from (almost) scratch. Video first seen on Animal Man Survivor . 
All that’s required is a cutting tool, which may very well be a knife or a stone with a sharp edge. and a piece of wood of the desired length. Watching the video will also teach you how to make a fire using what’s available in the woods, i.e. almost nothing. 
Oh, I almost forgot – here’s how to make a rock knife if you don’t carry a survival blade on your person 24/7 (not good). Video first seen on Captain Quinn . 
3. How to build a grass hut from scratch 
You do remember the holy trinity of survival, right? Food, water and shelter. I know that a grass hut made from scratch is not a tool per se, but it’s a shelter by any definition and it can be built basically anywhere on Earth, provided there’s grass available. Which means, almost anywhere. 
This project is easy to build, with a simple yet effective design and you’ll only require a sharp stone (or a knife) and a digging tool (stick, shovel, whatever). Here’s the video tutorial. Video first seen on Primitive Technology . 
4. How to DIY a Bow and Arrow from scratch 
While hunting with a spear requires some mad skills, bows and arrows are the ideal hunting tools for long-term wilderness survival. 
This video tutorial will teach you how to DIY a bow and arrow outdoors, using primitive “technology” – natural materials and tools made from scratch, i.e. a stone chisel, a stone hatchet, fire sticks and various stone blades. Video first seen on Primitive Technology . 
5. How to DIY a cord drill from scratch 
Check out this video tutorial and you’ll learn how to make a cord drill from scratch. This baby consists of a fly wheel, a shaft, and a piece of cord and it can be used for making a fire without getting blisters on your (soft) hands or for drilling holes. Video first seen on Primitive Technology . 
Now, with the “survival stuff” taken care of, let’s see about a few life-hacks, i.e. some “more benign” tools made from recycled materials. 
Next time you destroy a tape measure, you can improvise a depth gauge using a piece from the broken tape-measure by cutting out a twelve inch section using a pair of tin snips. To get an usable zero to twelve inch scale, start cutting at the beginning of a one footmarker and then use the ultra-thin, elastic material for measuring stuff in small/confined places 
You can use scrap wood from the shop for improvising a table saw push stick for keeping your hands and fingers on the safe side when feeding wood to the saw at a consistent rate. Video first seen on Adam Gabbert . 
Here’s how to make a scratch stock cutter from an old hand saw which can be used for scraping/scratching a decorative profile into a piece of wood, a method used by furniture manufacturers on historic pieces for creating a hand-made appearance. Video first seen on Wood By Wright . 
You can improvise an adjustable marking gauge by driving a dry-wall screw into a piece of wood. Video first seen on Paul Sellers . 
You can use an empty bottle as a glue dispenser, thus saving money by buying glue in bulk. You’ll require an empty bottle that features an extendable cap, which allows you to distribute a consistent amount of adhesive for, let’s say edge-gluing boards. 
When closing the cap, you’ll prevent the glue from drying out. The best bottles to use are bottles with sports caps, such as water bottles,, Gatorade bottles, or dish soap bottles. An expired credit card is excellent as a glue spreader. 
If you want to drill perfectly perpendicular deep holes without a drill-press, just use an old piece of mirror and position it against the drill bit. 
You’ll have to fine-tune the position of the drill until the reflection and the bit are combined in such a way that they look perfectly aligned. That’s all! 
Or you can make your own smart saw at home. Click the banner below to find out how to transform your ideas into real projects.

Vulnerable cities in the ISIS-occupied region include “Tal ‘Afar, Al-Ba’aj, Al-‘Ayadiyyah, Al-Mahlabiyyah, Sinjar, Wardiyyah, Sanuni, Khana Sor, Ibrat al-Saghira, Al-Badi, [and] Al-Qanat.”
Prisoners can be seen kneeling on the ground in an unknown location in northern Iraq, while so-called 'cubs of the caliphate', dressed in military outfits, stand behind them wielding hand guns.
In one scene a child rants to the camera about Putin's intervention in Syria before he and a second youngster shoot their captives - who were accused of being spies - in the back of the head.

C. From the Hollywood Reporter: “As much as I might love poking fun at the media and as much as you kind of deserve it sometimes, your job has never been harder,” she said. “You’re basically get paid to stand in a cage while a geriatric orangutan screams at you.   …     You expose injustice against the weak and you continue to   the president as if he might someday get embarrassed! Tonight is for you. ”   …     The special’s commercial breaks were led with taped sketches of Bee roasting a handful of previous presidents like Woodrow Wilson and Bill Clinton, complete with   garb. “This story has more wrinkles than the president’s nutsack,” she said of Ronald Reagan and the   affair, while Richard Nixon “achieved John F. Kennedy’s two goals: landing a man on the moon and getting f —  ed by a deep throat. ” The final sketch of this series had Bee roasting Mike Pence, who became president after Trump died after “getting his head stuck in a jar of honey. ” She was shown wearing a chastity belt and a   turtleneck: “I attempted to cover my pillows but the slut shines through. ”   …     One   segment skewered Jeff Zucker and CNN. “Zucker’s greatest success besides The Apprentice  —   which, by the way, thanks for that  —   is filling airtime between car crashes with a reality show loosely based on the news where   hacks make us measurably dumber by spewing mendacious nonsense while a hologram of Anderson Cooper stand by,” said Bee, pleading for the network to “free” its journalists. “Anderson is a smart reporter!

20482,20482,President Obama Is Handing a Strong Economy to His Successor - The New York Times,Patricia Cohen,"Departing occupants of the White House rarely hand off an improving economy to a successor from the opposing party. When Barack Obama was waiting in the wings after the 2008 presidential election, for example, the economy was in a severe downward spiral: Employers reported cutting 533, 000 jobs that November, the biggest monthly loss in a generation. But according to the government’s report on Friday, Donald J. Trump can expect to inherit an economy that has added private sector jobs for 80 months, put another 178, 000 people on payrolls last month and pushed the unemployment rate down to 4. 6 percent today from 4. 9 percent the previous month. Wage growth, though slower, is still running ahead of inflation, and consumers are expressing the highest levels of confidence in nearly a decade. The Federal Reserve is confident enough about the economy’s underlying strength that it is now set to raise the benchmark interest rate when it meets later this month. The jobless rate for November, the lowest since August 2007, “is a testimony to how strong employment growth has been,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. Jason Furman, now chairman of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, remembers the transition eight years ago, when he was crammed into his office with a circle of key officials as the latest jobs numbers from the Labor Department landed. “It was an utterly terrifying time, the likes of which none of us had ever seen in our lifetimes,” Mr. Furman recalled. Fearing that “the economy was following the same trajectory that it did at the beginning of the Great Depression,” everyone was focused on how to “rapidly slow the bleeding and figure out how to get the economy growing again. ” By contrast, Mr. Furman said, “the economy today is healthy and it’s improving. ” For all the improvements, tens of millions of Americans understandably feel that the recovery has passed them by. Those without skills are relegated to   positions without steady schedules, security and benefits. Breadwinners who once held   manufacturing jobs are angry about being forced to settle for   service jobs  —   or no jobs at all. Profound anxiety, particularly among the white working class, about the ability to reach or comfortably remain in the middle class is one of the factors that helped propel Mr. Trump to the White House. Pockets of weakness also surfaced in the latest jobs report, which showed that more people dropped out of the labor force last month than joined it. Manufacturing jobs declined further, and there are still plenty of   workers who would rather be full time. And while the official jobless rate for high school graduates fell to 4. 9 percent, it is more than twice the rate for college graduates. “There is a bifurcation of the work force,” Jonas Prising, chairman and chief executive of the ManpowerGroup, one of the largest recruiters in the United States. People who are able to take advantage of advances in technology, globalization and other shifts that favor those with the right skills for the nation’s advanced services are thriving. For others, the prospects do not look good. “There used to be part of the work force that had   jobs that were low or unskilled,” Mr. Prising said. “Those kinds of jobs are very difficult to find today. ” The deal that Mr. Trump made with the heating and cooling company Carrier this week to keep 1, 000 manufacturing jobs from moving to Mexico from Indiana is emblematic of the kind of actions he said he would take as president to help   workers. But there are limits to the power of persuasion. Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan and a former economic adviser to Mr. Obama, said that manufacturing, while still a driving force in the economy, employed fewer and fewer people. More than 80 percent of jobs are now in the service industry, Ms. Stevenson said, and Mr. Trump should be thinking more about how to match workers with those jobs. “The economy is in a great place, and his biggest challenge is continuing that,” she said. Some economists worry that the Federal Reserve is too focused on fears of future inflation and that it should hold off on any increase in rates until conditions have improved further. “There’s no reason to   slow the economy down, given that we’re starting from less than full employment,” said Elise Gould, an economist at the   Economic Policy Institute in Washington. “Right now, the priority should be keeping the economy on track and moving it forward. ” Such pleas are unlikely to win the day. At last month’s meeting of the Federal Reserve, members concluded that the case for an increase in the benchmark rate had been “strengthened,” and that they would be ready to move “so long as incoming data provided some further evidence of continued progress. ” Many employers are having a harder time finding and retaining workers. “Recruiting is a tough issue right now in skilled and semiskilled industries,” said Robert A. Funk, chairman and chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City. He mentioned a particular need for workers in accounting, information technology, call centers, warehousing and office and professional services. Mr. Funk said employers often complained about being unable to find employees with a strong work ethic who met the minimum requirements. “Drug screening is a real challenge in many parts of the country,” he said. “Only 30 percent can pass a drug screen in the state of Washington,” where marijuana is legal. At the same time, employers have been reluctant to raise wages to a level that might lure back sidelined workers. The result has been that the country has 5. 5 million job openings, a   level, but still relatively anemic labor force participation rates. “The challenge out there now is finding workers and keeping the workers you have,” said Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group. Those shortages, whatever the cause, are likely to push wages higher next year, he said. “People are feeling good not only about their current income but their future income,” Mr. Rick said. Whatever the economy’s current failings, Mark J. Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University in Virginia, said it was nonetheless better than the ones most incoming presidents have faced in the last  . “Trump can be thankful that his predecessor is handing him a fairly strong situation,” Mr. Rozell said, “especially when compared to many past party transfers of power. ”",0
20483,20483,nan,Enjoykin4,"A leading US senator: US Supporting War in Syria
A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
“If the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,” republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
“If we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia… would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.”
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are “thoroughly integrated.”
“They really are one and the same, they’re part of the same army,” he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency’s investigation in 2013, which showed Washington’s ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move “evolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
“We do it indirectly because it’s unlawful to do it directly,” he said, adding that the US keeps “extremely violent organizations… off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the “bad guys,” while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a “clear understanding of what’s happening over there.”
“Sometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment… but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.”
He further warned that the US itself could be “threatened,” arguing that, “if Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.”
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East “axis of evil,” naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and “particularly” Turkey over their support for terrorism.
“Probably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,” he asserted, describing the three countries as “the primary force behind the terrorist movement.”
“Turkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,” he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
“And now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,” he noted, further adding that Erdogan “has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.”
“He has become more and more aggressive; he’s crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he’s now a total dictator. He’s a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter… This is our great ally; we’re allied with a man who would be Hitler.”
He also blasted Washington’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, “where women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man’s permission; they can’t drive a car!”
“Somehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,” he said ironically, calling it “bizarre.”
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, “God bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,” despite being a “tiny little, poor nation.”
“I think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,” he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
“We don’t pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they’re our good allies,” he said, concluding that Washington is on a “suicidal course of action.”
“Saudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.”Black referred to the Western media’s portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, “The fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.”
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a “reflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.”",1
20484,20484,3 Top D.N.C. Officials Leave as Upheaval After Email Breach Continues - The New York Times,Alan Rappeport,"The   at the Democratic National Committee after an embarrassing breach of its email system continued on Tuesday with the departure of three senior officials. Amy Dacey, the committee’s chief executive Luis Miranda, its communications director and Brad Marshall, its chief financial officer, will leave amid a reshuffling of leadership positions, said Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman. The departures came more than a week after WikiLeaks posted almost 20, 000 of the committee’s emails, a number of which revealed officials showing favoritism toward Hillary Clinton in her primary campaign against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The messages confirmed the concerns expressed by Mr. Sanders throughout the campaign, cast a cloud over the start of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week and led to the resignation of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida as the committee’s chairwoman. Ms. Brazile praised the outgoing staff members and made no mention of the controversy. “Thanks in part to the hard work of Amy, Luis, and Brad, the Democratic Party has adopted the most progressive platform in history, has put itself in financial position to win in November, and has begun the important work of investing in state party partnerships,” she said in a statement. “I’m so grateful for their commitment to this cause, and I wish them continued success in the next chapter of their career. ” American intelligence officials believe that the Russian government was behind the breach of the committee’s emails and documents, possibly as part of an effort to damage Mrs. Clinton and sow discord in the Democratic Party. An email from Mr. Marshall to Mark Paustenbach, a communications official, and Ms. Dacey suggesting that the committee promote questions about Mr. Sanders’s faith drew particular scorn from the senator and his supporters. “It might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God,” Mr. Marshall wrote, referring to Kentucky and West Virginia. “He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. ” In May, Mr. Paustenbach wrote to Mr. Miranda about encouraging reporters to write that Mr. Sanders’s campaign was “a mess” after a glitch on the committee’s servers gave the Sanders campaign access to the Clinton campaign’s voter database. “Wondering if there’s a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess,” Mr. Paustenbach wrote. Mr. Miranda wrote back: “True, but the Chair has been advised to not engage. So we’ll have to leave it alone. ” The committee has since apologized to the Sanders campaign. To help fill the void, the committee announced, it is bringing on Tom McMahon, a former executive director of the committee, to lead a transition team.",0
20485,20485,And Now the Work Begins,Karl Denninger,"Today, in the light of the morning, what do we have in America today?
We have watched a tidal wave come ashore in Washington DC. We saw the impossible, according to the pundits. 
But let’s have a bit of sobriety to go along with the wry smile, ok?
We still have policy acts that need to be addressed. In specific order of priority:
Health care monopolies must be broken up and those in the industry who resist must be jailed under existing anti-trust law. This has to happen right up front, especially if we are going to do “tax reform” (and we should) or the result will be deficits that explode so fast, and so ruinously that they will force interest rates up to near or even beyond those of the early 1980s, bankrupting everyone at once that has any debt at all. Simply put you have to take close to a trillion dollars out of the Federal Budget and $2 trillion out of the economy as a whole in terms of spending in this sector or our nation does not fiscally survive. This was true yesterday and it still is. The problem is illustrated here and one potential set of solutions is here , along with my 2012 article here .. “Repeal and replace” will not do it ; you need to attack the problem, not remove the band-aids that were put over a sucking chest wound. President Trump can do the largest part of this without Congress since it requires only enforcing existing anti-trust law, and the responsibility to enforce the law rests solely with the Executive. The swamp must be drained. Candidate Trump repeatedly called for it. President Trump has to do it. Again, this is a function of existing law and therefore requires exactly zero Congressional buy-in. While cabinet-level positions require Senate approval the rank and file cop on the street positions in the US Government do not. There are an utterly insane number of crimes that have been committed over the last two terms and while the Statute of Limitations has run on some of them it has not run on all. Those for which prosecution is still possible must be prosecuted. This is not only important in the medical realm (see above) but also in the financial realm. We can start with Wells Fargo and their recently-exposed outrageous and blatant robbery of their customers but it must not end with “trophy” prosecutions. It is especially important for the stability of our markets and returning some resemblance of trust to them that all persons or organizations that have engaged in various forms of market manipulation which is illegal, I remind you, be held to account. Whether it be “spoofing”, placing orders you cannot clear (because you don’t have the margin to do so) or simply placing orders you never intend to execute (which is illegal and has been since the 1930s ) these crimes must be prosecuted as far back as the Statute of Limitations permits and aggressive prosecution on a forward basis must continue. Most of the rest of what President Trump has promised to do in his Contract with Voters does need Congressional approval. Yes, he can cancel executive orders that were outrageously improper — and he should. But when it comes to tax and trade policy for the most part those issues do require Congressional approval, and here’s the rub for any Republicans who think they can play “ Never Trump ” post this election: With both Houses of Congress there is only party to blame for any sort of obstructionism. If the Republicans wish to lose both houses of Congress in a couple of years all they have to do is keep larding up the debt and refuse to take the issues that must be addressed by both Congress and the Executive on, and it’ll happen.

20486,20486,How a Money-Losing Snap Could Be Worth So Much - The New York Times,James B. Stewart,"By now, even most of us over 35  —   old age, by Snapchat standards  —   are aware of the photo sharing and messaging app sweeping teenage and millennial America. Even if you have no interest in sending nude photos of yourself that   or in video lenses that enable you to vomit a rainbow, turn your head into a taco or make your eyes into glittering hearts, you may be wondering how such groundbreaking technology could be worth $34 billion. That was the value of Snapchat’s parent company, Snap Inc. after its first day of trading on Thursday. Its closing price of $24. 48 was 44 percent above the $17 offering price set late Wednesday. It’s the biggest initial public offering since Alibaba’s in 2014. At that price, Snap makes its much bigger rival Facebook  —   not to mention such internet stalwarts as Google, Amazon and even Netflix  —   look like   “value” stocks. Snap “looks tremendously overvalued to me,” said Brian Hamilton, a   of Sageworks, a financial analysis and valuation firm. Michael Nathanson, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, described Snap as a “field of dreams. ” Even with rosy growth forecasts, “at $22 billion, we’re looking at a stock trading at five to eight times estimated revenues in 2020,” he said before the valuation rose even higher. “The only companies in that domain are Facebook and Alibaba, and they have massive scale. And both of them are profitable. ” There’s no point in comparing Snap’s profits to any of those companies, since Snap doesn’t have any. The company lost $514. 6 million in 2016 and $372. 9 million the year before, according to the prospectus it filed in February. It has lost money every year since it began commercial operation in 2011 and has warned it may never earn a profit. The only comparable social media company that continues to lose money is Twitter, and no one at Snap wants anyone to compare it to Twitter. Twitter has struggled to add users and generate advertising revenue, even though it claims a user base of 319 million. It went public in 2013 at $26 a share. This week it was trading below $16 a share. So let’s be generous and ignore profit. How about revenue? Snap said it generated $404 million in sales in 2016. A valuation of $34 billion is about 84 times revenue. That’s six times as high as Facebook’s    ratio, which is 14. It’s 14 times as high as Google’s parent, Alphabet, which trades at just over six times revenue. Amazon trades at a mere three times. Even   Netflix trades at seven times. Compared with Snap, however, those are mature companies, whose growth rates have slowed somewhat as they’ve aged. As Mr. Nathanson and his fellow research analyst Perry Gold put it in a recent note to clients: “There is something brilliant about going public after only a few years of generating any revenue at all. The sky’s the limit and history is not a guide. ” To justify a valuation of even $25 billion, “you have to make some very lofty assumptions,” Mr. Hamilton said. “They would need to grow for the next 10 years at more than 50 percent every year with a profit margin of 25 percent, which is extremely high given that they are now losing money rapidly. ” He noted that very few companies had achieved such growth rates in the history of American business. But let’s ignore revenue, too. This is social media, after all, where “daily active users” and “engagement” are the coins of the realm. By the end of 2016, Snapchat had 158 million daily active users. By comparison, Instagram, probably the closest comparison and a formidable competitor to Snapchat, had about 30 million users when Facebook bought it in 2012 for what was then considered an   price of $1 billion. (Facebook had earlier tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion, which its founders rejected  —   wisely, it now appears.) And $1 billion now looks like a bargain compared to what investors are paying for Snap. At $34 billion, each of Snap’s daily active users is worth $215, six and a half times per user what Facebook paid for Instagram. As of January, Instagram reported 300 million daily active users. At $215 each, the Instagram app alone would be valued today at $64. 5 billion. These are static numbers, and what Snap is selling investors is growth. According to Snap’s prospectus, Snapchat user growth was 48 percent in 2016, about the same as the year before. If it can pull that off again next year, it would reach an impressive 234 million users, though still short of Instagram. The Snapchat story “is all about growth,” Mr. Nathanson said. “It’s not about economics. ” But Snapchat’s growth slowed sharply in last year’s fourth quarter  —   just about the time Instagram started its own version of Stories, a popular Snapchat feature where users post a sequence of photos or videos. It added just five million new users after adding an average of 15 million in the first three quarters. By comparison, 150 million Instagram users are now using its Stories feature. That’s already nearly as many as Snapchat’s entire user base. How much more can Snapchat grow? Unless it can break out of its youthful demographic, it may already be reaching an upper limit. The Kaiser Foundation estimates that adults age 19 to 34 made up 22 percent of the United States population in 2015. That’s a little over 70 million. Snapchat already has nearly that many users in the United States. Maybe Snap can squeeze more revenue per user, even if its user base doesn’t grow all that much. It’s currently generating an average of $5. 83 a year per user in the United States compared with Facebook’s North American average of $12. 81, the MoffettNathanson analysis notes, suggesting plenty of room to grow. But even doubling revenue doesn’t get Snap close to a Facebook valuation. There are, of course, superhigh revenue and   assumptions that put Snap in the ballpark of successful and more established social media companies in valuation. Still, very few analysts have publicly said they believe Snap is undervalued at these levels (and I looked for some). The most bullish report I came across estimated that Snap could be worth as much as $30 billion. But that’s based on an extremely aggressive revenue estimate of $3. 8 billion in 2018. Mr. Gold said some investors were buying into the I. P. O. but not to hold Snap for the long term. “People are saying they’ll wait for a valuation that’s truly astronomical, and then take the other side of the bet,” he said. “They feel Snap will be richly valued out of the gate but possibly run into trouble over the next few quarters. ” Despite many of its somewhat juvenile features, at a more profound level Snapchat is changing the way young people communicate, substituting images for language. “Snapchat has built a better mousetrap,” Mr. Nathanson said. “It’s engaging, and it’s fun, especially for young people. ” That’s a story that obviously appealed to investors starving for the next hot social media company. Whether they’ll want to cash in quickly or hold their shares for the long term remains to be seen. “This looks and smells like Twitter to me,” Mr. Hamilton said. “I’m concerned that investors will have to wait a very long time, if ever, before they see any meaningful appreciation. ” About the best Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Gold could come up with: Snap’s valuation isn’t “patently crazy. ”",0
20487,20487,"Donald Trump, Courting Evangelicals, Faults Hillary Clinton’s Policies and Character - The New York Times",Ashley Parker,"Donald J. Trump tried out several lines of attack against Hillary Clinton, at one point calling her “unfit to be president,” as he delivered an otherwise noticeably restrained speech to an audience of evangelical activists here Friday. Appearing before the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority conference, Mr. Trump promised to “uphold the sanctity and dignity of life” and to “restore respect for people of faith. ” But he also used the opportunity to press his case against Mrs. Clinton, portraying her as arrogant, attacking her economic policies and willingness to admit Syrian refugees into the country and questioning her judgment as secretary of state. “She’ll appoint radical judges who will legislate from the bench, overriding Congress, and I’ll tell you, the will of the people will mean nothing  —   nothing,” Mr. Trump said. “She will undermine the wages of working people with uncontrolled immigration, creating poverty and income insecurity. Hillary Clinton’s Wall Street agenda will crush working families. She’ll put bureaucrats, not parents, in charge of our lives, and our children’s education. ” Referring to Mrs. Clinton’s call for Mr. Obama to take in 65, 000 Syrian refugees, Mr. Trump also challenged her to instead “replace her support for increased refugee admissions” with “a new jobs program for our inner cities. ” “We have to temporarily stop this whole thing with what’s going on with refugees where we don’t know where they come from,” he said, adding: “We have to take a timeout. We have to use the money to take care of our poorest Americans and work with them so they can come out of this horrible situation that they’re in. ” Mrs. Clinton has been calling Mr. Trump temperamentally unsuited for the White House, and he tried to turn the tables. Mrs. Clinton “refuses to even say the words radical Islam  —   refuses to say it,” Mr. Trump said. “This alone makes her unfit to be president. ” He has vowed to deliver a major speech Monday attacking both Mrs. Clinton and her husband as personally corrupt, and on Friday Mr. Trump asserted that the email scandal that has overshadowed Mrs. Clinton’s campaign for months had its origins in such venality. “Hillary Clinton has jeopardized  —   totally jeopardized  —   national security by putting her emails on a private server, all to hide her corrupt dealings,” he said. The claim appeared to refer to concerns that the private server Mrs. Clinton used as secretary of state may have been more vulnerable to being hacked by foreign adversaries than the State Department’s email system. (Although the emails were supposed to contain only unclassified information, the department has retroactively withheld some of their contents as classified when reviewing them for release in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.) But Mr. Trump offered no backup for his claim that the private server was used to hide “corrupt dealings. ” Noting that President Obama had officially endorsed Mrs. Clinton on Thursday, Mr. Trump added, “First time ever, by the way, a president of the United States endorsed somebody under criminal investigation. ” But that assertion also goes beyond the known facts. The FBI is investigating Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private server, but agents have not yet interviewed her and it is not clear if she herself is a target of a criminal inquiry. A few young protesters interrupted Mr. Trump’s remarks, shouting “Dump Trump” and other slogans. After they were muscled out by security guards, Mr. Trump called them “professional agitators” who were “sent in by the other party  —   believe me. ” Mr. Trump’s speech Friday came as he is battling to regain his footing after weeks of missteps, none more damaging than his questioning whether a federal judge could preside fairly over a case against Trump University because the judge is of Mexican heritage. With party leaders expressing outrage and voicing doubts that he can unify Republicans and defeat Mrs. Clinton in November, Mr. Trump noticeably curbed his impulsiveness Tuesday night, promising in a prepared speech not to let his supporters down. Still, in a Bloomberg Politics podcast published Friday morning, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell raised the possibility of rescinding his endorsement if Mr. Trump did not “change directions. ” Alluding to what he called Mr. Trump’s “obvious shortcomings,” Mr. McConnell said, “It’s pretty obvious he doesn’t know a lot about the issues. ” Before the Faith and Freedom Coalition Friday afternoon, Mr. Trump again stuck mainly to a script, reading from teleprompter screens. But he still   in his characteristically clipped syntax. “We want to uphold the sanctity and dignity of life, marriage and family as the building block of happiness and success,” he said. “And by the way, I know many, many very successful people. The happiest people are the people that have had great religious feel and that  —   incredible marriage, children. It’s more important than the money, folks. Believe me. ” Mr. Trump  —   who has been married three times  —   does not hew to traditional conservative orthodoxy. He previously supported abortion rights, and he said earlier this year that Planned Parenthood has done “some very good work” for millions of women. And in response to North Carolina’s controversial new bathroom law, Mr. Trump said that transgender people should be able to use whatever bathroom where they feel most comfortable. But he nonetheless won the early endorsement of leaders like Jerry Falwell Jr. president of Liberty University, and successfully wooed evangelical voters during the primary, exit polls showed. Hogan Gidley, a former aide to Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, said that while evangelicals “would love to have a true evangelical in the White House,” they understood that Republicans required a broader coalition to win in November. “Republicans cannot win without getting evangelicals, and they can’t win only getting evangelicals,” Mr. Gidley said. “They have to expand the voter universe and so far, Trump has done an amazing job with that. ”",0
20488,20488,Barbra Streisand: ’I Don’t Know How We’re Going to Take Four Years’ of ’Disgraceful’ Trump - Breitbart,Pam Key,"Monday on MSNBC’s “Hardball,” in responding to the ongoing story that started at Sunday’s Golden Globes awards ceremony with remarks by actress Meryl Streep criticizing   Donald Trump and continued with tweets from Trump calling Streep “overrated” and a “flunky” for former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, actress and singer Barbra Streisand weighed in by wondering how we could take “four years of this. ”  Streisand said, “I thought she said what she said beautifully. And It’s easy enough to see the video online of Trump mocking  —   you just showed it  —   I completely agree with Meryl. It was heartbreaking moment and so beneath the dignity of the presidency, let alone any respectful person. What we need more is kindness and common decency. And what he did, how he reacted and how he needs  —   he has the need to talk back and insult anybody who doesn’t agree with him, and that’s pretty disgraceful. ” She continued, “What’s the signal to little children who watch television and see this behavior of the soon to be president of the United States? Little girls were heartbroken when Hillary Clinton didn’t get to to be president. So I think it’s what they see. Children will listen, I sang that in a song once,  and you know they will see and they will learn. And you know I’m in the middle of having my teeth cleaned. You caught me at a disadvantage. ” She added, “That is why you cant trust anything he says because if you get on his wrong side, he will blast you negatively  …     He had a New Year’s Eve party, but he wasn’t  generous to give that to his followers as a president. He had to charge for it  and put that money into this club. Don’t you think that’s a little strange?” She concluded, “I was very proud of her. She’s a wonderful actress and that he had to denigrate her talent because she spoke out. Why is he not sitting through briefings rather then tweeting this nonsense and rating wars with Arnold Schwarzenegger? I don’t know how we’re going to take four years of this. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
20489,20489,Clinton's Web Of Deception,Michael Cutler,"The unraveling of Hillary's corrupt sphere of influence. November 4, 2016 Michael Cutler 
The 2016 elections are in the final stretch and were shaken to the core by the latest revelations from FBI Director James Comey on Friday, October 28, 2016 as reported by NBC News on October 30 th , “ FBI Obtains Warrant for Newly Discovered Emails in Clinton Probe — as Reid Accuses Comey of Hatch Act Violation .” Once again the Clinton scandal is creating turmoil in a presidential election that has gone way beyond “unconventional.” Indeed, Tom Clancy could not have scripted this year's presidential election and intrigues. 
While Comey's recent remarks regarding the Clinton investigation have been extremely vague, the issue to focus on is how Hillary's use of a private computer server, private e-mail account and non-secure digital devices to store, send and receive classified materials may have drawn others into her tangled web of deception. 
The current focus of the Clinton quagmire is on whether or not the laptop computer shared by Weiner and his estranged wife contains sensitive information. If that laptop had been hacked both Weiner and Abedin could have been vulnerable to blackmail. This was an issue raised by Congressman Louie Gohmert, Texan Republican and former judge in a Fox News Business interview on October 31, 2016 in a segment that was posted under the title, “ Rep. Gohmert: Clinton is a potential victim of blackmail .” 
Additional individuals may also have been drawn into this web of deception through these e-mails as well. A chain is as strong as its weakest link. The weak links begin with Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin and may now include Anthony Weiner and perhaps others. Meanwhile, there is no way to yet determine how many other weak links are “out there” petrified that WikiLeaks or perhaps, a hacker may yet disclose their improper dealings with the Clintons or their foundation. 
Could not these additional individuals be subject to blackmail as well? 
Let's take a moment to understand how all of this began. 
Just months earlier Hillary Clinton had been let off the hook by an FBI Director who, in his official statement on July 5, 2016 , included this excerpt: To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances, a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now. 
By Comey's own words, anyone else might have had their security clearance lifted permanently. This raises the issue about such an individual demonstrating fitness for duty as president and raises the question as to why Comey did not see fit to take comparable action with Ms Clinton. 
Comey's ultimate decision to not present the case to a Grand Jury was frustrating to those who have had security clearances and fully understand just how profound an impact these transgressions might have on national security. 
However, perhaps Comey's hard to comprehend decision can be traced to a meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch less than one week before the FBI Director conducted that press conference. On June 29, 2015 ABC News-15 reported, “ US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Bill Clinton meet privately in Phoenix before Benghazi report .” 
That article served as a predication for my article, “ Loretta Lynch's Private Meeting With Bill Clinton Prior to Release of Benghazi Report : Why would the Attorney General, who sets the tone for law enforcement, do this?” 
As Attorney General, Lynch is FBI Director Comey's boss. 
At the time of this meeting the Justice Department was not only investigating Hillary's illegal use of a private e-mail server, non-secure personal digital devices but was also, conducting an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. 
In fact, on October 30, 2016 Breitbart reported, “ Clinton Foundation FBI Investigation Confirmed By Former Assistant FBI Director .” Therefore Bill Clinton, was likely the target of an ongoing criminal investigation yet he had a totally inappropriate private meeting with the Attorney General to supposedly discuss golfing and grandchildren. 
However, just days after that meeting, news organizations reported that Hillary was contemplating keeping Lynch on as Attorney General if she won the election. 
On July 4, 2016 Newsmax reported, “ NY Times: Clinton Weighs Keeping Lynch as Attorney General if She Wins .” Hillary's statement that she might keep Lynch on as Attorney General could have provided the incentive for Lynch to “Go along to get along.” 
Indeed, Lynch did precisely that during her confirmation hearing as I described in my commentary, “ Loretta Lynch: Same as the Old Boss : The Attorney General nominee's disturbing views on U.S. immigration law.” 
My article included an excerpt from a Yahoo/AP news report, ""Attorney General nominee defends Obama immigration changes."" Here is the exchange in which Lynch discussed the administration's immigration's policies: Lynch said she had no involvement in drafting the measures but called them ""a reasonable way to marshal limited resources to deal with the problem"" of illegal immigration. She said the Homeland Security Department was focusing on removals of ""the most dangerous of the undocumented immigrants among us."" Pressed by Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a leading immigration hard-liner, she said citizenship was not a right for people in the country illegally but rather a privilege that must be earned. However, when Sessions asked whether individuals in the country legally or those who are here unlawfully have more of a right to a job, Lynch replied, ""The right and the obligation to work is one that's shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here."" Sessions quickly issued a news release to highlight that response. Under later questioning by Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, Lynch clarified it, stating there is no right to work for an immigrant who has no lawful status. 
This was disturbing and telling, clearly Ms Lynch's views on immigration and likely, therefore on other issues are malleable and subject to revision if modifying her position is consistent with her personal goals. 
As Attorney General Lynch directs the operations of the entire Justice Department and all those who work for that department. Ms. Lynch must understand true democracy can only exist when justice is blind and totally objective. 
However, Lynch and the others who have fallen under Hillary Clinton's corrupt sphere of influence are trapped in Hillary's web of deception, having fallen victim to the Hillary Virus. Throughout Clinton's many decades in American politics, this highly contagious and virulent malady has proven to be virtually ineradicable. It is not likely to change no matter the outcome of the next election.",1
20490,20490,CNN’s Don Lemon on Chicago Torture Video: ’I Don’t Think It Was Evil’ - Breitbart,Katie McHugh,"CNN host Don Lemon said Wednesday evening the broadcasted torture of a bound and gagged victim in Chicago was not “evil,” adding that the suspects had “bad home training. ”[News broke nationally Wednesday after a Facebook Live video showed the victim beaten, slashed, held at knifepoint, and more in a Chicago apartment while assailants are heard saying “fuck white people” and “fuck Trump. ” Chicago police held a press conference the same day to announce an investigation is underway and four adults are in police custody. The suspects held the “traumatized” victim for as many as 48 hours, police said.  “The fact that this was a vulnerable person that was probably duped into going along with them. It appears it is someone who is mentally disabled, I think makes it even more sickening,” said guest Matt Lewis. “But at the end of the day, you just try to wrap your head around evil. That’s what this is, it’s evil. It’s brutality. It’s man’s inhumanity to man. ” “I don’t think it’s evil,” Lemon replied. “I don’t think it’s evil. I think these are young people and I think they have bad home training. I say, who is raising these young people? I have no idea who’s raising these young people. Because no one I know on Earth who is 17 years old or 70 years old would ever think of treating another person like that. It is inhumane. And you wonder, at 18 years old, where is your parent? Where’s your guardian?” During the same discussion, Democrat strategist and former press secretary for Bernie Sanders Symone Sanders said the attack was “not a hate crime” if the suspects were motivated by “hate of Donald Trump. ”  : Mediaite",0
20491,20491,Donald Trump Vows to Bolster Nation’s Military Capacities - The New York Times,Ashley Parker and Matthew Rosenberg,"PHILADELPHIA  —   Donald J. Trump on Wednesday called for a vast expansion of the military, including 90, 000 new soldiers for the Army and nearly 75 new ships for the Navy, requiring up to $90 billion a year in additional spending. But Mr. Trump did not match those numbers with details about how the country would raise the money, other than a promise to take steps like reducing wasteful spending, which military budget analysts said would be insufficient. Mr. Trump, in a speech at the Union League of Philadelphia, also vowed to order the military to devise a new plan to defeat the Islamic State “immediately upon taking office. ” The plan would come within 30 days from “my generals,” he added, without mentioning that those generals are the same ones who came up with the current strategy, which they believe is working. The speech was the latest effort by Mr. Trump’s campaign to demonstrate to voters that he can lay out detailed policy prescriptions to problems confronting the nation. It also seemed to be directed at the conservative foreign policy establishment, coming a day after Mr. Trump released a letter from about 90 retired military officials endorsing his campaign. He lamented the shrinking of the military and warned that enemies were preparing to capitalize on perceptions of American weakness around the world. “Our adversaries are chomping at the bit,” Mr. Trump said. “We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength. ” With the speech, Mr. Trump also moved to refocus his campaign on critiques of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival. Espousing a foreign policy “tempered by realism,” Mr. Trump portrayed Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, as unsuited to lead the nation’s armed forces. “Unlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction,” Mr. Trump said. “Hillary Clinton’s legacy in Iraq, Libya, Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering and death. ” But it was the size of the military, and the amount that the United States spends on its defense, that lay at the heart of Mr. Trump’s speech. In addition to increasing the Army to 540, 000 soldiers and adding the Navy ships, Mr. Trump proposed buying dozens of new fighter aircraft for the Air Force. To pay for the expansion, Mr. Trump said he would call on Congress to reverse the cuts to military spending made as part of the budget sequester in 2013, which was the result of a compromise reached between Democrats and Republicans. The new spending, Mr. Trump said, would not cost taxpayers an additional penny. He said he would eliminate wasteful government spending, increase energy production and trim the federal work force, including the military bureaucracy. He also suggested that he would collect unpaid taxes, which he said amounted to $385 billion. Asked about the plan, Todd Harrison, a military budget expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said, “Good luck. ” “Everyone comes in saying they want to reduce wasteful spending,” Mr. Harrison said. “Folks have tried that again and again, and they have largely not been successful. ” Although Mr. Trump said little about how much his plan would cost, the new military spending would probably amount to $80 billion to $90 billion a year, experts said. The additional soldiers alone would cost around $9 billion. Mr. Trump’s call for ending the sequester on military spending is unlikely to gain traction in Washington. Republicans have long pushed for lifting these limits  —   a proposal Democrats will consider only with comparable relief on domestic spending. And on Tuesday night, in a sign of the likely stalemate, Senate Democrats filibustered a military appropriations bill because it would have allowed for bursting through the caps on military spending without also doing the same for domestic spending. Mr. Trump’s remarks came before he was to appear Wednesday night at a Commander in Chief Forum televised from the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York and focused on security and veterans issues. Mr. Trump was questioned after Mrs. Clinton. Earlier on Wednesday, he described Mrs. Clinton as “reckless” and “totally unfit to be our commander in chief. ” Mr. Trump was turning the tables on a frequent line of attack from Mrs. Clinton and trying to lay the blame for the bloodshed in the Middle East at her feet, a critique that most experts have said is grossly oversimplified and misleading. “Sometimes it seemed like there wasn’t a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn’t want to invade, intervene in or topple,” he said. “She’s   and very unstable. ” The Clinton campaign fought back after the speech by highlighting the endorsement of more retired generals and admirals, saying Mrs. Clinton had gotten greater support “than any   Democrat due to her proven record of diplomacy and steady leadership on the world stage. ” In a foreign policy speech in April, Mr. Trump offered much the same thrust as in Wednesday’s address  —   presenting an at times paradoxical approach of using fiery oratory to promise a military buildup and the immediate destruction of the Islamic State, while also rejecting the   and interventionist instincts of George W. Bush’s administration. Mr. Trump also echoed other themes that he has used during his campaign, calling on allies to pay more for American military protection. “Early in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills,” he said. “Only five NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting their minimum requirements to spend 2 percent of G. D. P. on defense. ” He also accused the Obama administration of agreeing to bad deals with Iran. “Our president lied to us,” Mr. Trump said of President Obama, saying the nuclear deal with Iran put the country “on a path to nuclear weapons. ” But Mr. Trump’s fiercest criticism was saved for Mrs. Clinton. He accused her of being complicit in an array of foreign policy stumbles, and of deleting her emails as secretary of state to hide her participation in a “pay for play” scandal in which Clinton Foundation donors were granted special access. Damning his rival with false praise, Mr. Trump  —   in one of his speech’s biggest applause lines  —   also said that maybe Mrs. Clinton did have some wisdom to impart. “Hillary Clinton has taught us really how vulnerable we are in cyberhacking,” he said. “It’s probably the only thing that we’ve learned from Hillary Clinton. ”",0
20492,20492,Fact Checking the House Benghazi Committee’s Findings - The New York Times,Eric Schmitt,"WASHINGTON  —   The House Select Committee on Benghazi released its report on Tuesday detailing the attacks in Libya on Sept. 11, 2012, that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The   committee found no evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state. Here is a selection of summarized findings in the report, with fact checks: This criticism is not particularly new. Senior Pentagon officials have consistently said that they were constrained by the “tyranny of time and distance”  —   that is, that the military could not have sent troops or planes in time to have made a difference. The report and Republican critics have always countered that had the White House and Pentagon acted more swiftly, they might have mitigated the later attack on the compound’s C. I. A. annex. But it is unclear what forces might have made a difference there. _____ This sounds like dithering that might have cost American lives. But the uniform swaps reflect the chaos and confusion in sorting out what was going on in Benghazi, and whether American forces should arrive identifiable as United States military personnel or be less noticeable in civilian clothes. Even the report acknowledges the challenges facing the   FAST teams: These troops did not have their own planes, which meant delays waiting for flights did not travel with their own vehicles (they would need to find some in Benghazi when they landed) and were designed to deploy before a crisis hit, not during hostilities. _____ This suggests that the Obama administration was not treating the crisis seriously. But the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr. was not a critical player in the drama. He was only one of many senior officials involved in managing the crisis, and was briefed after his dinner. There were many other senior White House, State Department and Pentagon officials, both in Washington and overseas, dealing with the crisis throughout the night. An independent inquiry in December 2012, among others, came to a similar conclusion. That report faulted State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests from the American Embassy in Tripoli, Libya, for more guards at the Benghazi mission and for failing to make sufficient safety upgrades. As security in Libya worsened in the summer of 2012, the State Department remained committed to a security strategy to deploy a modest American security force and then increasingly rely on trained Libyan personnel to protect American diplomats. That strategy, which had been set a year earlier after the fall of Col. Muammar  ’s government, failed. Warning signs were indeed flashing red for months before the attack. The Obama administration received intelligence reports that Islamic extremist groups were operating training camps in the mountains near Benghazi. By June, the city had experienced a string of assassinations, as well as attacks on the Red Cross and on a British envoy’s motorcade. Mr. Stevens emailed his superiors in Washington in August, alerting them to “a security vacuum” in the city.",0
20493,20493,"Which Power Conference Won’t Vie for National Title? Sorry, Pac-12 - The New York Times",Marc Tracy,"There is a simple math problem at the heart of the college football season: five power conferences, four playoff spots. That is, at least one of the major football conferences, having played a full season and produced an impressive champion, will fail to land a team in the   College Football Playoff for the national championship. Two years ago, the snubbed conference was the Big 12, whose   Baylor and Texas Christian, ended up fifth and sixth in the selection committee’s final rankings. Last year, it was the   whose champion, Stanford, though an obviously impressive squad with a Heisman Trophy   in running back Christian McCaffrey, had committed the cardinal sin of losing two games when every other conference champion had lost one at most. Trying in September to predict who will play for the national championship in January is a fool’s errand. There are so many teams. There is so much roster turnover. The oldest players are barely  . And the argument is never really settled, nor can it be. “This is all fun to talk about  —   it kind of makes college football really go, that there is opinion involved, and that’s what differentiates it from the N. F. L. ,” the CBS college football analyst Gary Danielson said. “But this also leads to frustration. ” He added, “The difficult part of this is even a committee that has the task of deciding the final four goes about it in unusual ways. ” But that’s just it: During the past two seasons, we have come to know the committee  —   its idiosyncratic preferences, its quirky biases. At this early date, we may not be able to forecast which team will win it all. But we can hazard informed guesses about the following question: Which of the five major conferences will fail to place a member in the final four team bracket? For now, it is in the teams’ hands. But on the last several Tuesdays of the season, the selection committee will rank its top 25, based on a host of factors, including strength of schedule and advanced metrics. It will issue its final rankings on Sunday, Dec. 4, after the conference championship games. This year, the national semifinals will take place on Dec. 31 at the Peach Bowl in Atlanta and the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Ariz. The winners will meet Jan. 9 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. Eight teams have made the playoff during its first two years (Alabama has done so twice) and all entered as conference champions. This is one of the committee’s stated metrics, and while the Big 12’s lack of a conference championship game kept its members out in 2014, last season’s Big 12 champion, Oklahoma ( ) sneaked in ahead of Stanford ( ) of the  . As with the Bowl Championship Series algorithm that preceded the playoff, the committee values winning percentage, perhaps over strength of schedule: Witness its placing last year of not only Oklahoma but Iowa ( ) which lost its conference championship game after a relatively soft schedule, over Stanford, which thrashed Southern California after a more difficult   slate. One more pattern: Both of the snubbed conferences in previous years, the Big 12 and   were, at the time, the only two to play   conference schedules. And each year, conference rivals took turns handing others defeats the committee member Condoleezza Rice memorably called it “fratricide. ” Conference depth  —   producing multiple tough matchups against familiar foes, sometimes at distinctly unfriendly stadiums, and fewer doormats  —   is the ultimate playoff obstacle. So which conference provides the clearest path to an undefeated or   conference champion? The one with an   schedule and the least depth: the Atlantic Coast Conference. Despite the presence of feisty No. 19 Louisville, it is a decent bet that either   Florida State or   Clemson  —   which is coming off a national title game appearance and is led by the Heisman Trophy contender Deshaun Watson at quarterback  —   will cruise to   (or perhaps  ). It is even more likely that the winner of the annual game between the two (Oct. 29, in Tallahassee, Fla.) will eventually claim the conference title and earn a playoff spot. The Big Ten’s top playoff contenders are all in the East Division  —   No. 6 Ohio State, No. 7 Michigan and No. 12 Michigan State  —   creating a potential   of defeats. The Buckeyes are among college football’s youngest teams, while the Wolverines face a punishing road schedule (at No. 17 Iowa, at Michigan State, at Ohio State). That could allow the Spartans, winners of two of the past three conference titles, to emerge in the best shape. “Whenever I do an interview, it’s always about Ohio State and Michigan,” the ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit said. “It’s almost like Michigan State’s not playing. ” The Big 12 appears   with No. 3 Oklahoma and No. 13 T. C. U. The Southeastern Conference is unlikely to be snubbed, though that would certainly produce amusing talk radio. The conference most likely to be left out, then, is again the  . Not because its teams are not good enough. Mostly because too many of them are. “I don’t see one or two teams that just stand out,” Herbstreit said. “I think it’s going to be one of those years where you have a   team coming out of there. ” Consider: No. 8 Stanford has to travel to No. 14 Washington, which has to travel to No. 24 Oregon, which has to travel to No. 20 U. S. C. And the winner of that North Division must still beat the winner of the South in the conference championship game. Danielson summed up the paradox, saying, “I would say the   is the   conference, but has the toughest road to the final four. ” “Which,” he added, “is a problem. ” There are other potential problems. Two conferences could be snubbed if one league lands two teams in the playoff or if Notre Dame, an independent ranked 10th, qualifies or if a Group of 5 conference champion elbows its way in. The last situation might be most likely: If No. 15 Houston beats Oklahoma on Saturday, then beats Louisville later in the season and goes unbeaten through its American Athletic Conference slate, there may be a race to see whether the Cougars get an invitation to the playoff or to the Big 12 first. Finally, with resurgent Tennessee ranked ninth, running back Leonard Fournette probably entering his final season with No. 5 Louisiana State, and Alabama ranked No. 1, fratricide in the SEC remains a possibility, too. But if the SEC finds itself without a team in the playoff, it would do well to stage its own, with its best four teams. The competition would be about as good.",0
20494,20494,WIKILEAKS: Hillary Got $12 Million for Clinton Charity As Quid Pro Quo For Morocco Meeting,nan,"Email 
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arranged a $12 million donation from Moroccan King Mohammed VI to her family’s charity in 2014 in return for the Clinton Global Initiative hosting its international meeting in the North African Muslim nation, according to an email made public Thursday by Wikileaks. 
The Moroccan monarch’s funds went to the Clinton Foundation’s endowment and to CGI. The Jan. 18, 2015, email was included in Wikileaks’ latest batch of communications to and from Clinton’s presidential campaign chairman, John Podesta. 
The email from Huma Abedin, Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department, was addressed to Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook. Hillary Clinton was a director of the foundation at the time. 
Singapore and Hong Kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the CGI meeting in their countries, but the North African nation ultimately hosted it in a five-star hotel in Marrakesh, Morocco, in 2015. Abedin told Podesta and Mook that Morocco was not CGI’s “first choice.” 
The actual meeting was paid for by OCP, the Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations. Clinton vigorously supported the Moroccan King when she was Secretary of State and the U.S.-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure as Secretary of State. 
The mining company also contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, according to the charity’s web site.Abedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss. Hillary Clinton “created this mess and she knows it,” she told Podesta and Mook.She said the Moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss. “This was HRC’s idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx. $12 million both for the endowment and to support the meeting.” HRC stands for Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
Abedin said Clinton’s attendance at the CGI event was a condition of the $12 million contribution. “Just to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter,” Abedin said. 
Politico in 2015 reported that Clinton “was seen by Rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the Obama administration.” Rabat is the capital of Morocco. 
The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with “serious human rights violations,” including exploitation of workers by not “adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there.” 
Mohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the Polisaro Front, as reported by AL-Monitor, a Middle East news site in 2015 that “OCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation — it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years.” 
Polisaro claims to lead a Moroccan government-in-exile based in Tindouf, Algeria. 
“They’re doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara,” Beisat charged. 
The Moroccan firm mines phosphates. Human rights critics have called OCP’s mining product “blood phosphates,” appropriating the term “blood diamonds” for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers 
OCP is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the Clinton Foundation. The foundation accepted a $100 million pledge from Lukas Lundin, who owns mining and oil drilling operations in North Africa and in the Congo. (RELATED: Clinton Foundation Got $100M From ‘Blood Minerals’ Firm) 
OCP retained the law firm of Covington & Burling, one of Washington’s lobbying giants, paying the firm $1.4 million in fees from 2012 to 2015. 
Stuart Eizenstat, a former White House domestic policy chief under President Carter and an influential Democratic Party insider, was the main lobbyist for the mining firm. He was also President Bill Clinton’s ambassador to the European Union, a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and Under Secretary at the Department of Commerce. 
Eizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at Commerce where he worked in the International Trade Administration. 
Hillary Clinton officially visited Morocco twice, in November 2009 and in February 2012, meeting with the King on both occasions. The two also met in New York in December 2013 where it was believed the two discussed Morocco’s bid to host the CGI meeting and the King’s $12 million donation. 
The Moroccan World News described the meeting as showing “renewed friendship between the royal family and the Clinton family, as well as Hillary Clinton’s esteem for Morocco and its people.” 
Abedin warned both campaign executives that if CGI decided to renege on the agreement, it would hurt Clinton’s relationship with the King. “It will break a lot of china to back out now,” she wrote. 
Ultimately, Clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign, but the former president and daughter Chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the Moroccan King’s palaces.",1
20495,20495,Credit Cards Encourage Extra Spending as the Cash Habit Fades Away - The New York Times,Nelson D. Schwartz,"Nina Falcone has given up on cash. Whenever and wherever possible, even at the vending machines in her building in Chicago, the    marketer uses her Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards card to collect points she says she uses for plane tickets to visit her family in California. Ms. Falcone carefully follows the advice from consumer advocates and does not carry a balance from month to month or pay humongous interest charges. But she admits there are probably some downsides to the ease of purchasing. Time magazines piled up around her apartment and gathered dust after she bought a subscription simply because it came with an offer for extra points. And she has increased the amount of time she spends shopping on the Internet because merchants offer incentives online for cardholders that are not available in stores. “I haven’t paid for a trip on Southwest in years,” says Ms. Falcone, which may be technically true, but a host of economic and social science research suggests that consumers tend to spend more using plastic than they ever would with actual cash. Incentives like   miles or rewards points only amplify a temptation that banks and financial services companies have been profiting from for decades. “When you vary the payment method, people are willing to pay more,” said Duncan Simester, a professor of marketing at M. I. T. who published a landmark paper on the subject in 2001. “You’re not forking over a dollar bill, so there is less sensation of loss. ” With M. B. A. students as the subjects, Mr. Simester and a colleague, Drazen Prelec, held an auction of tickets to basketball and baseball games featuring two local teams, the Boston Celtics and the Boston Red Sox. Some participants were told they would have to pay by credit card, others were informed that only cash would be accepted. When credit cards were an option, the M. B. A. students offered to pay roughly twice as much as they were willing to hand over in cash for the same tickets. “The most surprising thing was the size of the effect,” said Mr. Simester, who titled the resulting paper ‘Always Leave Home Without It: A Further Investigation of the   Effect on Willingness to Pay.’ ” He added that while it was not unusual to see spending patterns shift by 5 or 10 percent in experiments, “you don’t see too many examples where people offer double what they would have otherwise. ” But the ease of buying with plastic, or what marketers call “  spending,” is only half the story. Social scientists have also found that consumers have been conditioned by even the sight of credit card logos to want to spend more. Unlike Mr. Simester, who created an experiment from scratch, Richard Feinberg of Purdue University persuaded restaurants near campus in West Lafayette, Ind. to let him study actual patrons’ spending habits. Mr. Feinberg placed credit card logos and symbols on some tables and left others without them, as normal. The sight of images associated with credit cards prompted diners to spend more and leave bigger tips. A similar exercise in a faculty member’s office produced larger donations to the United Way, Mr. Feinberg added, while credit card images bolstered sales at a Fannie May candy store. “People spend more when these stimuli are present,” he said. “Just as Pavlov found that dogs would salivate when they heard tones that were associated with food, people have been conditioned to associate credit cards with spending. ” Although tools like Apple Pay and other mobile payment methods are too new to have generated much academic research, or allowed the kind of conditioning that half a century of credit card use has produced, Mr. Feinberg suggests a similar dynamic could be at work. “The less friction there is, the easier it becomes to spend,” he said. “Just stand at Starbucks and watch how many people there use their smartphones to buy a latte. ” Speaking of lattes, credit cards also encourage people to pay more for everyday items than they might otherwise, according to Scott Bilker, founder of debtsmart. com and the author of “Talk Your Way Out of Credit Card Debt. ” “Paying $5 for a coffee might seem like a lot if you only have $10 in your wallet,” he said. “But if your credit card has a $10, 000 limit on it, it doesn’t seem like much. ” The key, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. com, a personal finance website, is to try to exercise the same discipline with plastic that you would with cash, despite the urge to splurge. If you can’t help yourself, or occasionally do have to carry a balance, avoid incentive cards at all costs. “They only work for consumers who pay their balances in full,” he said, as Ms. Falcone does scrupulously each month. For the 60 percent of consumers who can’t pay off what they owe each month, a much smarter bet would be to seek out the card with the lowest possible interest rate. Of course, even the best card rates are still high  —   the typical consumer today has $2, 200 in credit card debt, with an average annual interest rate of nearly 16 percent, according to Bankrate. com. Does that mean consumers should cut their cards up, stick to cash the way our   had to and embrace the supposedly traditional value of thrift? It’s not that simple today, nor was there really ever a golden age when Americans bought only what they could truly afford, said Lendol Calder, a professor of history at Augustana College in Rock Island, Ill. “The river of red ink has run through American history from the beginning,” said Mr. Calder. “The Pilgrims took out loans from London investors and many of them died without ever having paid off their debts. As far back as you go, people were in over their heads. ” That said, Mr. Calder says he believes credit cards do offer advantages, despite the inevitable temptation to spend more. “Credit cards are useful because people want to be thrifty with time,” Mr. Calder explained. “In the 20th century, time became scarce and credit cards and credit in general helps with that. It’s one thing to save and save and buy an engagement ring for someone you love, but not if you wait and she runs off with someone else. ”",0

20497,20497,Biden and Trump Agree to Fight Pistol Duel--Final Arrangements Pending,nan,"Thursday, 27 October 2016 Biden and Trump to Duel 
Seeking to duplicate, if not surpass, the famous duel between Vice President Aaron Burr and Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, Republican candidate for president, Donald Trump, and Vice President Joe Biden, agreed to fight a pistol duel. Although details of the duel have yet to be finalized, Amiko Aventurista, reports the duel will likely take place on the eve of the election. 
Three independent sources confirmed negotiations over broadcast rights are extremely tense. Trump demands the duel be the inaugural show of his new venture, Trump TV. ""It was my idea. I was the one who said I could shot someone on Fifth Avenue and my supporters would be with me. Other than Hilary, Obama, Rubio, Cruz, Jeb Bush, and a ton of others, I can think of no one better to shot than hair plug Joe. I'm the greatest shooter ever. A real sniper."" 
Biden insist MSNBC must be the broadcaster because its liberal and minority audience wants to see Trump with several gun shots. In a response to Trump, Biden said, ""There is no way I can miss. His hair glows bright orange. All I have to do is point toward the glow"". 
Megan Kelly of Fox says Fox must host the show because she wants to see ""blood"" coming everywhere out of Trump just like he said blood was coming out of her. CNN's Wolf Blitzer decline to comment. Even ESPN is making a play for the event, pointing out it regularly shows non-traditional sporting events, such as bull riding, cross bow, and bowling. 
Both sides agree Lin Manuel Mirada, producer of the hit Broadway show, Alexander Hamilton, should direct the event. Manuel Mirada said, ""I would be honored to produce the event. I know my smash Broadway hit, Hamilton, is only a show about a duel not a real duet but I think that experience qualifies me to produce a show about a real duel. After all, the only difference is the guns are real."" 
The National Rifle Association (NRA) has agreed to fully pay for and sponsor the event. NRA President Wayne LaPierre release the following statement, ""Finally we have bi-partisan agreement. I should have thought of this first"". Make Amiko Aventurista's  ",1
20498,20498,Arianna Huffington Is Leaving Huffington Post - The New York Times,Sydney Ember,"Since it started 11 years ago, The Huffington Post has been synonymous with the personality and the interests of its   Arianna Huffington. The pioneering web publication, known for its aggressive use of aggregation and an unapologetically liberal worldview, would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize and expand globally during a challenging time for all media organizations. But over the last year, The Huffington Post has found itself an increasingly small part of an increasingly large media and tech conglomerate. When Verizon, which announced it had purchased The Huffington Post’s parent company, AOL, in May 2015, bought Yahoo’s internet business last month, Ms. Huffington’s perch at the company seemed increasingly precarious. With her abrupt announcement on Thursday that she was stepping down as editor in chief of The Huffington Post and leaving the company to focus on her new venture, a health and wellness   called Thrive Global, she leaves the publication in an unfamiliar position. For the first time since its founding in 2005, The Huffington Post will be without Ms. Huffington. No successor was named. In an interview, Ms. Huffington, 66, said she had originally intended to run The Huffington Post while working to start Thrive Global. But that plan soon reached its limits. “The original idea was that I could do both,” she said. “But it very quickly turned out to be an illusion. ” Along with her success, Ms. Huffington has been a polarizing figure in the media world, and her presence in the newsroom has not always been constant. But since Verizon bought AOL, her interests seemed to increasingly move beyond running The Huffington Post. After the sale, there was speculation that she would leave the company, concerns allayed when she signed a   contract in June 2015. Other moves have generated misgivings in the newsroom. The publication’s decision last summer to put articles about Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign in its entertainment section and a later decision to add an editor’s note calling Mr. Trump a “serial liar” and a “racist” to any article about him raised questions about whether Ms. Huffington was unduly influencing coverage to suit her political agenda. In April, the announcement that she was joining Uber’s board rankled employees who feared inherent conflicts of interest in coverage. (She said she would recuse herself from being involved with any coverage of the company.) The publication has also been criticized for what some see as excessive coverage of sleep and wellness, topics on which Ms. Huffington has written books. At the same time, staff attrition, evidenced by a flurry of goodbye emails over the last year, has taken a toll on morale. In that context, Ms. Huffington’s decision to leave surprised an already anxious newsroom. At a staff meeting Thursday morning in The Huffington Post’s Manhattan headquarters, Ms. Huffington stressed her confidence in the organization. “Great companies always succeed beyond their founder,” she said, according to an article by Michael Calderone, the publication’s media reporter. “Even though HuffPost bears my name, it is absolutely about all of you and about this amazing team we’ve been for over 11 years. ” Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL, was not present. But in a statement, he called Ms. Huffington a “visionary who built The Huffington Post into a truly transformative news platform. ” “Today, The Huffington Post is a firmly established and celebrated news source, and AOL and Verizon are committed to continuing its growth and the groundbreaking work Arianna pioneered,” he added. When The Huffington Post was founded, there was no Twitter, and Facebook was still a relatively fledgling online platform primarily used by college students. Initially, the idea was to create an aggregation site that would be a liberal counterpart to the Drudge Report. Ms. Huffington, who had recently run for governor of California, said at the time that she had signed up more than 250 of “the most creative minds” in the country, including Walter Cronkite, Nora Ephron and Norman Mailer, to write a group blog on topics including politics and entertainment. The Huffington Post did not just take the internet seriously it ruthlessly embraced as opportunities trends that established media companies perceived as threats. The company demonstrated early and continued mastery over Google, capturing audiences through search with carefully engineered headlines and fast aggregation. The publication consistently outranked its competitors in search, often with blog posts based on its competitors’ work. But while the strategy proved successful, the site’s ability to package articles from other publications also prompted criticism, and many in the media world accused it of aggregation excesses that bordered on intellectual theft. Over the years, however, it has pushed aggressively to produce more original content. The site also published articles by   who often contributed without being paid. AOL purchased the publication for $315 million in 2011 and Ms. Huffington assumed control of AOL’s editorial content. The Huffington Post won a Pulitzer Prize in 2012 for a series on wounded veterans. Ms. Huffington’s relationship with Mr. Armstrong was rocky almost from the start, several current and former employees said, and some said her outside interests kept her out of the newsroom for extended periods. When AOL sold itself to Verizon for $4. 4 billion, there was speculation that Ms. Huffington might leave. She had become an increasingly powerful force in her own right: She has published several books on health and wellness, including “Thrive” and “The Sleep Revolution,” and she has become a champion of the benefits of a good night’s sleep. Though Ms. Huffington’s departure came as a shock, it was in some ways inevitable, particularly after she announced the formation of Thrive Global in June. In the interview, Ms. Huffington said she had thought about leaving The Huffington Post for “a while,” and the closing of a funding round for Thrive Global last week ultimately drove her move. “It was my decision” to leave, she said, adding that the contract she signed last year had a   clause that allowed her to start a new venture. Ms. Huffington said she would stay on at the publication until early September. “I’m going to be very much around for the rest of the month, helping in every way I can, including having Greek sweets in my office,” she said, a nod to her home country and her distinctive accent. Mr. Armstrong said in a note to staff that the company had formed an interim editorial committee that would act in Ms. Huffington’s place. The committee will also be involved in what Mr. Armstrong described as “an ongoing search” for a new editor in chief. In a separate note to employees, Jared Grusd, the chief executive of The Huffington Post, called Thursday a “day of change. ” “Today,” he wrote, “is the first day of the next chapter in HuffPost’s history. ”",0
20499,20499,"Gordie Howe, Mr. Hockey for the Red Wings, Dies at 88 - The New York Times",Richard Goldstein,"Gordie Howe, one of the greatest and most durable players in the history of hockey, who powered his Detroit Red Wings teams to four Stanley Cup championships and was 52 years old when he finally hung up his skates, died on Friday in Ohio. Howe  —   Mr. Hockey to the sports world  —   was 88. The Red Wings said he died at the home of his son Murray in the Toledo area. Howe, who received a diagnosis of dementia in 2012, had a stroke in 2014 that impaired his speech and movement. Wayne Gretzky was celebrated as the Great One for his scoring prowess. Bobby Orr was recognized as hockey’s incomparable defenseman. But Howe, who learned the game on the frozen ponds of Saskatchewan, could do it all, and he kept at it after his hair had turned silver and he had become a grandfather. “If you were ever going to make a mold for a hockey player with five strengths  —   offense, defense, durability, toughness and versatility  —   you wouldn’t look past Gordie Howe,” Scotty Bowman, the N. H. L. ’s leader in coaching victories and a   Stanley Cup winner, once said. “In my estimation, he was the best ever. ” Gretzky idolized Howe as a young player, wearing his No. 9 in amateur leagues and donning red and white socks to copy Howe’s Red Wings attire. “There’s one Gordie Howe, and it’s as simple as that,” Gretzky said when he closed in on Howe’s career points record in 1989. “I’m not ever trying to replace him. ” Howe played professional hockey for 32 seasons, most of them with the Red Wings. Playing at right wing, he scored with subtle maneuvers at a time when the slap shot had yet to become a favorite offensive weapon and defensive play was strong. He handled the puck magnificently, setting up teammates with precise passes. He inflicted crushing body checks and   elbows or   on opponents who had incurred his ire. There was hockey’s traditional hat trick  —   three goals by a player in a single game  —   and what became known as the Howe hat trick: a goal, an assist and a fight. At 6 feet and 205 pounds, Howe was relatively big for his era and had a body   for hockey, with long arms, a strong torso and outstanding balance. Playing before helmets were required, he endured numerous injuries and some 500 stitches in his face. He almost died during the 1950 playoffs when he crashed into the boards trying to check Ted Kennedy, a star forward with the Maple Leafs Howe sustained a fractured skull and had emergency surgery to relieve pressure on his brain. Howe teamed with his fellow Hall of Famers Sid Abel at center and Ted Lindsay at left wing on a unit known as the Production Line when the Red Wings dominated the league in the early 1950s. “Pinpoint passing,” Abel once said. “They used to say that if you blindfolded us, we’d still be able to find one another. All of us knew where everyone else was at any given moment. ”’ ”By the time Howe retired for the second and final time in 1980 as the oldest player in N. H. L. history, he had set records for most seasons (26) games played (1, 767) goals (801) assists (1, 049) and points (1, 850). He won both the Hart Trophy as the N. H. L. ’s most valuable player and the Art Ross Trophy as the league’s top points scorer six times.” ’Orr, who starred with the Boston Bruins, marveled at Howe’s blend of supreme talent and combativeness. “He has the reputation of being a tough player and using his elbows and so on,” Orr told USA Today in 1999. “But Gordie Howe can play any way you want him to play. You want to play tough, you play tough. You want to just play, you play. He didn’t shy away from anything. He was the total package. ” Howe was named a   or   N. H. L.   21 times. The four Stanley Cups he helped the Red Wings win came in 1950, ’52, ’54 and ’55, when the N. H. L. was a fiercely competitive   league. After playing for Detroit from 1946 to 1971, he had seemingly retired. But after two seasons off the ice, he teamed with his sons Mark, a future Hall of Fame defenseman, and Marty, a left wing, for six seasons in the World Hockey Association and in a final year with the N. H. L. ’s Hartford Whalers. In his 25 seasons with the Red Wings, Howe was among the N. H. L. ’s top five scorers for 20 consecutive years. At 50, he led his team, the New England Whalers of the W. H. A. in scoring with 96 points. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972 during his first retirement, the normal   waiting period having been waived. Hailed throughout the hockey world, Howe was especially revered in Detroit, much like the Tigers’ Ty Cobb and boxing’s Joe Louis. Montreal Canadiens right wing Maurice Richard, the only challenger to Howe’s   in their era, may have had greater flair as a shotmaker, but Howe was the more complete player. Eddie Shore, the Bruins’ Hall of Fame defenseman of the 1920s and ’30s, was the original Mr. Hockey. Howe once recalled: “He saw me play a game and I hadn’t scored a goal, but defensively I came in handy a few times. He came over and he just congratulated me and said, ‘You’re playing the game the way it should be played. ’” Gordon Howe was born on March 31, 1928, in Floral, Saskatchewan his family moved to nearby Saskatoon when he was a few days old. He grew up there as the fifth of nine children, playing hockey outdoors with makeshift equipment, the prairie winds raging and temperatures far below zero. “We had to play with a tennis ball instead of a puck,” he once recalled. “The ball would get so hard we’d have to get new ones all the time. A woman next door used to warm them up in an oven for us. ” He honed his physique by doing construction work with his father. At age 14, Gordie lifted five   bags of cement at a time while building sidewalks. Howe signed with the Red Wings organization at 16, spent two years in the juniors and minors, then made his N. H. L. debut at Olympia Stadium in Detroit on Oct. 16, 1946, scoring against the Toronto Maple Leafs goalie and future Hall of Famer Turk Broda. Howe never equaled what had been the   goal record of 50, set by the Canadiens’ Richard in   falling one goal short eight seasons later. But he broke Richard’s career goal mark of 544 in 1963. Howe retired in 1971 to take a   post with the Red Wings, presumably intending to remain off the ice. But he was given little to do, and he returned to the game in 1973 when the W. H. A. was created, gaining an opportunity to play with his teenage sons under a $2 million, multiyear deal with the Houston Aeros. Howe scored 174 goals in the W. H. A. playing with his sons through four seasons with Houston and two with the New England Whalers. In   the three Howes played together in the N. H. L. when the New England team, having been renamed the Hartford Whalers, joined the league after the dissolution of the W. H. A. Howe scored 15 goals and had 26 assists in his final N. H. L. season. At the age of 69, he took a   turn on Oct. 3, 1997, for the International Hockey League’s Detroit Vipers to become hockey’s only   professional. As skilled as he was, Howe could be a brutal player adept at retaliating for a slight when the referee was not looking. “It’s a man’s game,” he once said. “You have to be tough to survive. I learned right off that throwing the first spear was the best way. ” Stan Mikita, the Chicago Blackhawks’ Hall of Fame center, once told The Detroit Free Press what happened after he cut Howe under the eye early in his career. “A couple of minutes later at the Olympia, we were both turning in the Wings’ end. The next thing I remember I was at the Chicago bench, my head is killing me. Our backup goalie, Denis DeJordy, said he was the only one in the building who saw what happened. Gordie had skated by me, slipped his right hand up under his armpit, pulled out his fist, popped me in the jaw and put his glove back on. “A few shifts later, he ambled by and asked if I learned anything. I said, ‘Are we even?’ Gordie says, ‘I’ll think about it. ’” Howe and his wife, Colleen, were a savvy couple off the ice. Colleen, his agent in his last years in hockey, formally registered the name Mr. Hockey and developed extensive family business enterprises along with his endorsements. They promoted the Howe Foundation for charitable work. She was found to have Pick’s disease, a rare form of dementia, in 2002 and died seven years later at 76. In addition to his sons Mark, the director of pro scouting for the Red Wings Marty and Murray, a physician, Howe is survived by his daughter, Cathy Purnell a sister, Helen Cummine nine grandchildren and four  . His brother Vic, who played briefly for the Rangers in the 1950s, died last year. When he neared his 75th birthday, Howe spoke of the key to his long career. “There is no doubt in my mind that it was my love for the game,” he told The Free Press. “To succeed, you’ve got to love what you’re doing. I tell kids, if you don’t love it, get out of the way for someone who does. ”",0

20501,20501,Lena Dunham’s ‘Girls’: Unborn Baby a ‘Parasite Growing Inside of You’,Dr. Susan Berry,"The April 2 episode of HBO’s Girls finds Hannah Horvath  —   played by actress Lena Dunham  —   hearing from her gay friend Elijah that the baby she is carrying is a “parasite” growing inside of her. [The episode, titled “What Will We Do This Time About Adam?” shows Hannah, well along in her pregnancy, reevaluating her decision to be a single mother.  “Oh, God. Hannah, this is gonna be a real mindf**k for me if you wanna get an abortion right now,” Elijah tells her. “I mean   …     I’ll do it. I think there’s about two doctors in America that do it at this stage in your pregnancy, but I’ll find them. ” Writing at Newsbusters, Dawn Slusher observes some of the “fake” information about   abortion that Girls serves up in this episode  —   first and foremost being Elijah’s reference to the difficulty in finding an abortionist to perform one: “There are not just ‘two doctors in America’ who will ‘do it at this stage.’ There are actually 162 abortion clinics that perform abortions after 20 weeks. Secondly, most don’t realize just how easy getting a   abortion is legally, given the loose definition of “health” that was buried in Roe v. Wade’s companion case, Doe v. Bolton: ‘  …     all factors  —   physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman’s age  —   relevant to the wellbeing of the patient. All these factors may relate to health.’ All Hannah needs to say is that she has a headache, is too young, too tired, or is having anxiety about having a baby and she can legally get an abortion at any point in her pregnancy. ” At the federal level, abortion is still legal in the United States up until the time of birth, although more states are  enacting laws that restrict the procedure. The abortion industry has fought against any attempts by states to restrict abortion or to mandate health and safety standards in abortion clinics. Its allies in the liberal media portray abortion as a safe procedure that is welcomed by women. In its recent report titled “Unsafe: The Public Health Crisis in America’s Abortion Clinics Endangers Women,” Americans United for Life (AUL) demonstrates in its analysis the many state officials who look the other way when it comes to inspections of abortion clinics. The organization asserts: “Importantly, even limiting the scope of our investigation to the last eight years, efforts to discern the true state of abortion practices was stymied by a dearth of protective laws in a number of states, a lack of reporting in others, and limited public availability of information on abortion providers in still more states. ” “We can easily deduce, therefore, that the epidemic of substandard abortion practice is worse than even these pages show,” AUL states.",0

The political gamble that will be the Trump presidency traces back to the desperation of Americans who lost out in the social experiment of neoliberalism — and the Democrats’ candidate who personified those economic inequities, says Greg Maybury. 
By Greg Maybury 
In horseracing parlance, when a particular horse wins unexpectedly the bookmakers’ call this a “turn-up for the books.” In more general usage, the phrase came to mean an unexpected piece of good fortune, a pleasant surprise, or something generally welcomed especially if not deemed likely. While conceding those who didn’t want nor expect it might think otherwise (not least the “defeated favorite”), if we confine its meaning to this usage, Donald Trump’s Oval Office win by any definition is a “turn-up for the books,” the best example — this side of Harry Truman in 1948 at least — the Grand American Narrative has to offer. President-elect Donald Trump 
As might be anticipated, in the wake of Trump’s historic victory — a win that for all sorts of reasons has shaken the Beltway establishment and beyond to its core, and one that political junkies will be fixating on for years — there’s been much handwringing about how so many folks got the outcome so wrong. All of this has been accompanied by the obligatory hyperventilating and existential angst about what Trump’s election portends for the future. 
His campaign both revealed — and “reanimate” — the tectonic forces that hold sway in the political equivalent of the San Andreas Fault , a long-neglected fault-line in American politics that has been waiting to let rip for decades. At the risk of overcooking the geological metaphors, we might imagine that if folks were presented two highly improbable scenarios before this election and had to bet their house on only one as the more likely outcome — the choice here being either a Trump win or California sliding into the Pacific Ocean after the actual San Andreas finally lets the “big one” rip — many might have picked the latter. Now, expect political aftershocks until further notice. 
The reality — to say little of the irony — of a political neophyte and ostensible outsider winning a U.S. presidential election (to say nothing of claiming the actual nomination whilst summarily seeing off 16 of his own party’s rivals in the primaries) without the support of said party, Wall Street or the mainstream media and with half the money of his opponents by breaking every rule in the electioneering field book then defeating the other party’s nominee, a seasoned campaigner and professional career politician whose own party (and the usual “suspects,” the MSM, Wall Street, Israel Lobby et. al.) all had earlier anointed as the presumptive nominee from the start and whom they all collectively backed to the hilt — from the still relatively popular incumbent on down — with the most effective, ruthless, formidable, sophisticated, cashed-up political machine ever assembled, must indeed be unprecedented. 
With Clinton herself winning the popular vote convincingly ( some suggest it could nudge 2 million), this of course is not a “landslide” in any conventional sense, and is not quite the conservative “revolution” some pundits are breathlessly celebrating. But as noted few if any election outcomes were as unexpected. To the extent it represented a “landslide” of sorts, in this case it was a “landslide” of the contemporary political imagination in; the substrata has shifted underneath people’s feet and moved to spaces that were hitherto unthinkable, and possibly about which few might lay claim to having much idea of what to expect. 
And this is happening at both ends of the political spectrum and just about every key point in between, with the Bernie Sanders factor testament to that. Even if on the face of it with the Republicans winning, both parties will now have to reinvent themselves not just as a matter of course, but of survival, at least as major political forces. Such is the extraordinary nature and character of this election and its outcome! 
Win or lose though, Trump’s impact was always going to necessitate a whole rethink about the way politics is conducted in Washington, a “rethink” both parties will avoid at their peril. That “rethink” should entail everything from how they function as political parties and how they manage themselves and how they position themselves with voters, to how they interact with each other at the Congressional cum legislative level so they begin managing national affairs more in the interests of their constituents than those of themselves and their families, their political cronies and/or corporate benefactors. More than that, they will need to be seen to be doing so. 
Let there be no mistaking it. The Republicans are no less on the take than are the Democrats — albeit with in some cases different constituencies and for possibly different reasons. And they are no less so because of their windfall victory now than they were before the campaign even started. The GOP did win by default in some respects, with no shortage of people not unreasonably seeing the Democrats as losing more than the Republicans winning . 
That neither party comes up smelling like roses in the scheme of things then is a longstanding reality brought into much sharper relief by this election. There are still for example many unanswered questions about the degree to which both parties played fast and loose with fundamental democratic principles and electoral legalities , about which there was relativity little reporting in the MSM. 
In the aftermath, many will rightly question not only Hillary Clinton’s suitability as the party’s nominee; courtesy of the revelations about the manner in which the Democratic National Committee’s primary campaign was conducted, they will also be able to question her political legitimacy as the nominee and, especially, the integrity and credibility of the party machine mindset that plotted her ascension. Indeed, that should be a prerequisite going forward for party reform. 
Yet if the Republicans think Trump’s win — while retaining control of both the House and Senate — redeems them and their party in the eyes of voters or the citizenry in general, one expects they will be sorely disappointed as we move forward. And this is only partly attributable to the fact Trump was not their preferred choice of candidate; indeed, he was rejected by many, a point we should never forget. 
The seeds of discontent ushering in Trump then may have been planted some time back, but the current GOP fraternity and their forbears cleared the ground. Whether in opposition or in the White House, the GOP also has tended the neoliberal and globalization garden. Trump’s campaign rhetoric aside, it remains to be seen how much of an enthusiast he will be for more of the same. 
Skin in the Game 
There can be little doubt the election outcome reflected considerable dissatisfaction with President Obama. Because he had so much skin in the game (his legacy for one thing), the President personally has to cop much of the rap for the rise of Trump (or even someone like him). The corollary to this is the President also accepting responsibility for the defeat of his own party when there was an obvious alternative in Bernie Sanders, someone who clearly tapped into much of the prevailing sentiment in working- and middle-class America that Trump did.

After noting that Clinton’s and the Democrats’ loss wasn’t a defeat by default, Walden Bello says in an article titled “How Obama’s Legacy Lost the Elections for Hillary” that instead of jobs and relief, Obama offered only half-measures to folks we call here in Australia “ battlers, ” in this case especially struggling people in the Rust Belt and beyond, the broad demographic that delivered victory for Trump. Bello says, “On the economic issues that motivate these voters, Trump had a message: The economic recovery was a mirage, people were hurt by the Democrats’ policies, and they had more pain to look forward to should the Democrats retain control of the White House.’ 
There was a telling report emanating from Obama’s European visit that gave us an insight into the incumbent President’s preoccupation with Trump and what — in his mind at least — to make of his victory. Quite apart from hinting at something of a personal struggle coming to terms with it, the President seemed also at pains defending his legacy from an all-out Trump onslaught next year. 
“ Americans chose Donald Trump … because of a vague ‘change’ desire,” the President said, while insisting that voters “don’t always know what they’re looking for.” Obama added, they may opt for change, “even if they’re not entirely confident what that change will bring.” The President reportedly went further, saying he “could have precluded Trump’s populist uprising if only [the Republicans] hadn’t blocked so many of my economic proposals.” 
Although it appeared to escape him when he made these remarks, the irony of the first part of Obama’s comments should not be lost on anyone else, given the considerable gap between the amount of vague change he promised and actual change he delivered (or for many, failed or declined to deliver). 
In short, this can and does apply to Obama himself. To the extent voters “don’t always know what they’re looking for,” we might now at least argue they are less equivocal about what sort of change they don’t want and aren’t looking for! And the subtext here might have been: Did they know exactly what they were looking for when they voted him into office, twice ? 
As for Obama’s not unreasonable comments about GOP obstructionism throughout his time in office (a reprehensible tactic on their part that notwithstanding their recent electoral success and now dominance of the Beltway, has come at great and possibly permanent cost to the party’s brand), we might ponder an alternative question for the incumbent: 
Could Obama have “precluded” Trump’s rise or impact by ponying up on a few more of his core promises, spending his political capital more wisely and fairly, more dutifully avoiding the errors of judgment, arrogance and political shenanigans of his much-reviled predecessor, and showing Main Street America in general and America’s “battlers” in particular he was the real McCoy after all, a president truly in their corner and not just another Wall Street political front-man cum errand boy? 
We can’t answer that question of course with absolute confidence, suffice to say the “answer” is destined to become an enticing, enduring counterfactual. But there can be little doubt Trump’s appeal and subsequent success was driven by the lost promise — actual or perceived — of the Obama years, and the President must be acutely aware of this. 
In truth Number 44 has no one else to blame but himself if Trump dismantles all or even part of his legacy. With a backward nod then to the earlier horse-racing motif, the President backed the wrong “horse” — even betting the farm — when in Bernie Sanders he, the DNC and the party faithful had an eminently electable alternative to the “Queen of Chaos.” Given the way the DNC campaign was conducted – the Democratic leaders’ own appalling shenanigans showcased in all their “ugly glory” courtesy of the Podesta email “reveals” — that , we can now safely say, was never going to happen. 
In the Paradise of Opportunity 
Above and beyond Obama (or for that matter any previous president since Reagan at least), Trump’s win then has also been driven by a widespread, deep-seated lack of faith and trust — accumulated over the past few decades — in the integrity of the democratic system of government and contempt for those who purport to represent the people’s interests.

In what must serve as the quintessential master class of prolonged, consistent, truly bi-partisan cooperation American politics has on offer, both parties have contributed enormously over the past three-plus decades to the dismantling if not effective destruction of the American Dream in its hitherto real and imagined dimensions. 
Whether on broad economic, social, national security, or foreign policy issues, both parties have demonstrated a recidivistic, palpable indifference to the concerns and needs of average working- and middle-class Americans, with both repeatedly showing themselves prone to elitism, corruption, cronyism, manipulation, greed, deception, bribery, hypocrisy, opportunism, self-interest, contempt, cynicism and arrogance. 
In the process democracy’s once “proprietary” domains — equal justice, freedom, human rights, equality of opportunity, civil rights, liberty, and most everything from habeas corpus to the pursuit of happiness — have effectively been declared “no-fly-zones” for ordinary people, accessible only to those increasingly privileged, mostly unelected, and thoroughly unaccountable few. 
Most significantly, both parties have undermined, possibly irreparably, the sense of pride and place folks had in their once beloved — but now maybe not so — United States of America. Along with that, they have all but conspired to “deep-six” that once famously enduring, optimistic mindset that by some accounts enabled the country to thrive and prosper as a “paradise of opportunity” (or even a reasonable facsimile thereof). 
Let’s term that period The Era of Future Promise, or that time in history — from 1945 to say 1975 — where a whole generation or more of the majority of folks could not only envision a progressively better future for their kids and grandchildren, but anticipated it, and all things equal, if one was willing to strive for such, rightfully expected it. 
That is no longer the case for an increasing number of people, and it is this sentiment — one whose seismic impact we have just witnessed — that’s been neglected by both party majors. That this envisioned future is no longer realistic for many comes as a direct result of neoliberalism — the roll-out of which was overseen by both parties — and with it the globalization of economic and financial activity itself culminating from there via “casino capitalism” in the inexorable transfer and consolidation of historically unprecedented wealth, power, and income into the hands of fewer and fewer people — is inarguable. 
Now the end of this earlier era might have been heralded by Reagan’s ascension in 1981 and the advent of neoliberalism. But its sustained demise was enthusiastically presided over by Bill Clinton, in cahoots of course with this year’s DNC candidate for president, his wife Hillary, and the then Party establishment. Some folks clearly haven’t forgotten that. In short, there was no clear sign from Clinton that things would be substantially different under her regime than under that of her husband’s administration. 
The Democrats will seek elsewhere to attribute blame for their loss — it was the FBI’s James Comey and his on-again/off-again investigation of Clinton’s email servers; it was voter suppression and racism; it was Bernie Sanders campaign and misogyny; it was third parties and independent candidates; it was the corporate media for giving Trump the platform, social media for being a bullhorn, and WikiLeaks and/or the Russians for airing the DNC dirty laundry. 
Naomi Klein had this to say about the result: ‘But this leaves out the force most responsible for creating the nightmare in which we now find ourselves wide-awake: neoliberalism. That worldview — fully embodied by Hillary Clinton and her machine — is no match for Trump-style extremism. The decision to run one against the other is what sealed our fate. If we learn nothing else, can we please learn from that mistake? Here’s what we need to understand: a hell of a lot of people are in pain. Under neoliberal policies of deregulation, privatization, austerity and corporate trade, their living standards have declined precipitously. … They have lost jobs. They have lost pensions. They have lost much of the safety net that used to make these losses less frightening. They see a future for their kids even worse than their precarious present.” 
There can be little doubt that fundamental to Trump’s win — and it should be emphasized, no less so than with Sanders’s popularity and success — was a feeling the trickle-down of the Reagan years did not work for most. This can be seen as the first genuine, appreciable expression of that frustration. 
In his entreaties to voters to bring the jobs back for example, Trump promised them something that almost certainly he will struggle to deliver even if he is serious about making it a policy priority, but in doing so he clearly tapped into a rich vein of discontent. 
Cleaning the Stables 
This election has exposed a major chink in the armor of the hitherto impregnable, indomitable two-party-system, seen now by more as corrupt, decrepit, and bankrupt. The rise and impact of political outliers such as Trump and Bernie Sanders on largely opposite ends of the standard political spectrum is pro-forma evidence grassroots Americans — especially those not welded to that system and have legitimate grievances about the direction in which the established elite are taking them — are onto something. The Wall Street bull statue by Arturo Di Modica 
That the additional reality this situation is deteriorating even further across almost all strata of the “Main Street” political economy and permeating all aspects of life once synonymous with — and essential to claiming a stake in — the American Dream (even in its more modest imaginings), should be obvious to all but the most politically myopic or deluded. 
But while the ties that bind Uncle Sam and all he stands for to his long-suffering subjects are strong, it remains to be seen if Trump can do much more than just “drain the swamp.” Indeed, the bigger challenge will be to restore faith in the American Dream. With the former prerequisite task on its own akin to Hercules cleaning out the Augean Stables with a teaspoon and a toothbrush while its occupants are still in residence (given this is Washington we’re talking about, this metaphor may work on more than one level), it’s enough to say Trump will have his work cut out on both counts. 
With the record firmly in mind, we might define at this point three monumental errors of judgment made by the DNC hierarchy, all of which contributed to the Trump victory: their preferred choice of candidate when they had a highly credible, electorally appealing, and eminently electable alternative in Bernie Sanders; the manner in which it was revealed the Clinton primary campaign was conducted and the revulsion it engendered and damage it caused; and the fact that over the past 30 odd years the Democrats’ brand among its most historically important constituencies had lost much of its political allure. 
In sum, the Clinton campaign might have been better served by resuscitating that immortal mantra from Bill Clinton’s first White House tilt in 1992 — and here I am not talking about “two for the price of one’! I’m thinking here about legendary Clinton strategist James Carville ‘s “It’s the economy, stupid!” 
Underpinning the Trump debacle was sustained “group think” within the DNC camp, the key state of mind of which can be summed up in one word. Hubris. This “hubris” was in part fueled because it was “Hillary’s turn,” and partly fueled by a conviction someone like Trump could not possibly win. To be fair, this predisposition toward “hubris” is not proprietary to the Democrats; the GOP — many of whom also felt “someone like Trump could not possibly win”— can invariably be relied upon to provide stiff competition with their own unique manifestations when the need arises. Trump’s win is unlikely to temper that. 
Where to From Here? 
With both political parties increasingly and so obviously beholden to Wall Street and the global corporate oligarchy, the ever-widening disparities in income and wealth, and ”core principle” democracy now relegated to “poor cousin” status in the political economy then, it is also just as clear many Main Street Americans were pondering an altogether pessimistic outlook for their own and the next generation if the socio-economic scales continue to weigh in favor of the above power elites and against the interests of the middle- and working-class, and broader citizenry. President Bill Clinton, First Lady Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea parade down Pennsylvania Avenue on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, 1997. (White House photo) 
Although there was relatively little discussion in the MSM at least throughout the campaign of specific issues like economic inequality and income and wealth disparities, there can be little doubt Trump tapped into the sentiment that attends these matters. As Joe Lauria noted about Trump’s win, a “new political force” in America has been unleashed. 
Lauria added, “Millions of discontented Americans who have lost out to the computerization and the globalization of the economy — and who have been disproportionately called on to fight America’s ‘regime change’ wars — have made clear that they aren’t going to take it anymore.” 
The way Lauria sees it then, any party or politician going forward “better listen or they will be tossed out, too,” including Donald Trump if he doesn’t deliver the goods. 
Jordan Chariton, a political reporter for “The Young Turks” news show, said despite being a historically weak candidate, Hillary Clinton’s defeat wasn’t just about Hillary Clinton. The Rise of the Forgotten Deplorables has been a work in progress for some time. For him, “Clinton was the final lifeline to a neoliberal bubble built by the Clintons and many others — that finally popped on November 8th, 2016.” 
He cites some of the factors that might have had contributed to the disenfranchisement and disillusion: Bill Clinton, not Ronald Reagan, “pulled” down Glass-Steagall , the cornerstone of banking regulation for 60 years. Clinton, not Reagan, deregulated credit-default swaps (CDS), the “financial WMDs” that blew up the world’s economy in 2008. And it was Clinton, not Reagan, who signed NAFTA , the largest nail in the American middle class’ coffin. 
The additional reality is that the socio-economic “fabric of the republic” is fraying even further across all strata of the “Main Street” political economy and permeating all aspects of life once synonymous with — and essential to claiming a stake in — the American Dream (even in its more modest imaginings), should be obvious to all but the most politically myopic or deluded. 
And for those who understood there being such a thing as a “class war” and viewed globalization and neoliberalism through such a prism — if we recognize that the upper class won that war a long time ago — we might posit the following: Why when after the vanquished have long since surrendered to distraction, disillusion or outright despondency are the victors still fighting the war? Before this election, the short answer we might have suggested is that it’s because they can! 
In a piece earlier this year in The Guardian ( “ Neoliberalism — the Ideology at the Root of all our Problems”) , Georges Monbiot places the blame for most of the parlous state of the global political economy on the blowback from neoliberalism, a social engineering experiment of sorts anchored by what became an inviolable economic ideology and which arose as a conscious attempt to “reshape human life and shift the locus of power,” a goal few objective observers would argue has long ago been achieved. It became in effect a Weapon of Mass Disenfranchisement, sold on the utterly — and knowingly — fraudulent notion that “every child player wins a prize,” with enticements of “trickle-down effects” and “rising tides.” 
Monbiot also dutifully reminds us that neoliberalism’s central tenet proclaims competition as the “defining characteristic” of human relations, while redefining citizens as consumers or customers, whose “democratic” choices are best exercised by “buying and selling, a process that rewards merit and punishes inefficiency.” 
Moreover, he warns: “Perhaps the most dangerous impact of neoliberalism is not the economic crises it has caused, but the political crisis. As the domain of the state is reduced, our ability to change the course of our lives through voting also contracts.” 
If the arrival then of Donald Trump doesn’t qualify as a “political crisis” of sorts for America, it will do until the real one gets here. For those who supported him, as to whether he will change the course of their lives (presumably for the better), that remains a big unknown. Expecting that a billionaire businessman — a man who symbolizes everything that is the very antithesis of their own lives — to change said lives appreciably is probably a big ask. Well might we say, “good luck with that!” 
Throughout the campaign Trump demonstrated his mastery at keeping folks guessing as to what his next move would be, and continues do so in transition mode. It will be of great interest going forward then to see to what extent he continues to do this once he enters the White House, and especially to see what the ramifications might be for ordinary Americans in those areas that really matter for them. 
All of which is to say, we’re in for a few surprises, for better or worse. The Trump ego is legendary. of course, and the best we might hope for is that it doesn’t all go to the new President’s head! Now that would indeed be another “turn-up for the books.”

20503,20503,Global Temperatures Are on Course for Another Record This Year - The New York Times,Henry Fountain,"The world is on pace to set another high temperature benchmark, with 2016 becoming the third year in a row of record heat. NASA scientists announced on Tuesday that global temperatures so far this year were much higher than in the first half of 2015. Gavin Schmidt, the director of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies, said that while the first six months of 2015 made it the hottest   ever recorded, “2016 really has blown that out of the water. ” He said calculations showed there was a 99 percent probability that the full year would be hotter than 2015. Dr. Schmidt said the world was now “dancing” with the temperature targets set last year in the Paris climate treaty for nations to limit climate change. He attributed part of the rise in temperatures this year to El Niño, in which warming waters in the equatorial Pacific Ocean pump a lot of heat into the atmosphere. El Niño is now ending, and water temperatures in the Pacific are dropping, which should lead in 2017 to lower but still historically high temperatures. Average temperatures for the first six months of this year were about 1. 3 degrees Celsius, or 2. 3 degrees Fahrenheit, above the average in 1880, when global   began, and “quite close” to 1. 5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, Dr. Schmidt said in a conference call with other NASA scientists. The warming in the first half of this year extended across all parts of the planet except for most of Antarctica, Dr. Schmidt said. Warming was especially strong in the Arctic, where it had an effect on sea ice coverage. Walt Meier, a scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said that the geographical extent of the Arctic ice so far this year was the lowest for any   since satellite   began in 1979, largely because warm temperatures caused melting to begin as much as two months earlier than usual. “It’s been an extreme beginning to the year for sea ice,” he said. It is not yet clear if this year will exceed the record for the lowest   extent, set in 2012, because most of the melting takes place later in the summer. Warming of 1. 5 degrees Celsius has special significance because at the Paris climate treaty in December, the world agreed to aim to limit the increase in average global temperatures to that amount above preindustrial levels. Dr. Schmidt said that the Paris target referred to sustained temperatures over the long term. “I certainly would not say that we have now gotten to that initial Paris number and are going to stay there,” he said. “But I think it’s fair to say that we are dancing with that lower target. ” Dr. Schmidt said that although NASA did not usually offer midyear updates to its global surface temperature analysis, it had decided to do so now “because average temperatures for the first half of this year are so in excess of any first part of a year we’ve seen. ” January 2016 was the hottest January since 1880, and that distinction continued for each month through June, NASA said. Dr. Schmidt said that although El Niño contributed to some of the increase in temperatures from last year, almost all of the increase since the 1960s was because of   emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Forecasters now expect that later this year,   temperatures in the Pacific will become lower than normal, a condition called La Niña. That should result in somewhat lower global temperatures next year, he said. The NASA announcement reflects   trends in a climate affected by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That is distinct from   weather trends like the heat waves that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued warnings about this week for much of the eastern half of the United States. NOAA’s National Weather Service has issued heat warnings and advisories for much of the Plains, the Mississippi Valley and Midwestern and Southern states, saying temperatures could be well above 100 degrees through the weekend.",0
20504,20504,Updated Brain Map Identifies Nearly 100 New Regions - The New York Times,Carl Zimmer,"The brain looks like a featureless expanse of folds and bulges, but it’s actually carved up into invisible territories. Each is specialized: Some groups of neurons become active when we recognize faces, others when we read, others when we raise our hands. On Wednesday, in what many experts are calling a milestone in neuroscience, researchers published a spectacular new map of the brain, detailing nearly 100 previously unknown regions  —   an unprecedented glimpse into the machinery of the human mind. Scientists will rely on this guide as they attempt to understand virtually every aspect of the brain, from how it develops in children and ages over decades, to how it can be corrupted by diseases like Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia. “It’s a step towards understanding why we’re we,” said David Kleinfeld, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the research. Scientists created the map with advanced scanners and computers running artificial intelligence programs that “learned” to identify the brain’s hidden regions from vast amounts of data collected from hundreds of test subjects, a far more sophisticated and broader effort than had been previously attempted. While an important advance, the new atlas is hardly the final word on the brain’s workings. It may take decades for scientists to figure out what each region is doing, and more will be discovered in coming decades. “This map you should think of as version 1. 0,” said Matthew F. Glasser, a neuroscientist at Washington University School of Medicine and lead author of the new research. “There may be a version 2. 0 as the data get better and more eyes look at the data. We hope the map can evolve as the science progresses. ” The first hints of the brain’s hidden geography emerged more than 150 years ago. In the 1860s, the physician Pierre Paul Broca was intrigued by two of his patients who were unable to speak. After they died, Broca examined their brains. On the outer layer, called the cortex, he found that both had suffered damage to the same patch of tissue. That region came to be known as Broca’s area. In recent decades, scientists have found that it becomes active when people speak and when they try to understand the speech of other people. In the late 1800s, a group of German researchers identified other regions of the cortex, each having distinct types of cells packed together in unique ways. In 1907, Korbinian Brodmann published a catalog of 52 brain regions. Neuroscientists have relied on his   map ever since, adding a modest number of new regions with their own research. “This is the standard for where you are in the brain,” said Dr. Glasser. Three years ago, Dr. Glasser and his colleagues set out to create a new standard. They drew on data collected by the Human Connectome Project, in which 1, 200 volunteers were studied with powerful new scanners. The project team recorded   images of each participant’s brain, and then recorded its activity during hours of tests on memory, language and other kinds of thought. In previous attempts to map the cortex, scientists typically had looked only at one kind of evidence at a time  —   say, the arrangements of cells. The Human Connectome Project has made it possible to study the brain in much greater detail. In addition to looking at the activity of the brain, the scientists also looked at its anatomy. They measured the amount of myelin, for example, a fatty substance that insulated neurons. They found sharp contrasts in myelin levels from one region of the cortex to the next. “We have 112 different types of information we can tap into,” said David C. Van Essen, a principal investigator with the Human Connectome Project at Washington University Medical School. Using these variables, the scientists trained a computer with data from 210 brains to recognize discrete regions of the cortex. Once the computer profiled the distinctive combinations of myelin, activity and other characteristics, they tested it on 210 other brains. The computer pinpointed the regions in the new brains 96. 6 percent of the time. The scientists found that only a small number of features were required to map the brain. That means that researchers will be able to use their method to map an individual’s brain in a little over an hour of scanning. The map produced by the computer includes 83 familiar regions, such as Broca’s area, but includes 97 that were unknown  —   or just forgotten. In the 1950s, for example, German researchers noticed a patch on the side of the brain in which neurons had little myelin, compared with neighboring regions. But the finding was soon neglected. “People tended to ignore it, and it was lost in the literature,” said Dr. Van Essen. The computer rediscovered the odd territory, and Dr. Van Essen and his colleagues found that it becomes unusually active when people listen to stories. That finding suggests the region, which they call 55b, is part of a language network in the brain, along with Broca’s area. In other parts of the cortex, the scientists were able to partition previously identified regions into smaller ones. For example, they discovered that a large region near the front of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, actually is made up of a dozen smaller zones. The region becomes active during many different kinds of thought, ranging from   to deception. It’s possible that each of the newly identified smaller parts is important for one of those tasks. The computer program developed by the scientists became so adept at mapping the cortex that it could identify hidden regions even when they took on unusual shapes. Twelve of the research subjects, for example, have a 55b region that’s split into two isolated patches. (The researchers don’t know whether this affects how the subjects use language.) Other neuroscientists hope that the new map will sharpen their experiments, allowing them to discover how the brain’s cogs mesh. “The next big step is seeing what this can do for us in terms of buying more power,” said Emily S. Finn, a graduate student at Yale University who has used Human Connectome Project data to find links between brain activity and intelligence. Dr. Kleinfeld predicted that other researchers will find ways to verify the new map’s accuracy. Genetic testing, for example: If 180 regions of the cortex really are distinct, then the neurons in each should share a distinct combination of active genes. “You can imagine going to these 180 regions, taking a punch of tissue, and seeing if you can really genetically differentiate them,” said Dr. Kleinfeld. Many experts believe that the brain, on closer inspection, will turn out to be an even greater collective of regions that somehow cooperate for the common good. “It’s very clear that many of those regions are likely to be composed of smaller pieces,” said Danielle S. Bassett, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Van Essen said that he and other scientists will be using the map to track the development of young brains and to look for changes caused by disorders like Alzheimer’s disease. “We shouldn’t expect miracles and easy answers,” he said, “but we’re positioned to accelerate progress. ”",0

20506,20506,Egyptian Christians Cancel Easter Festivities in Mourning Over Palm Sunday Massacre,"Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.","The main Christian diocese in Egypt has announced that it will not hold Easter celebrations this year, in mourning for the 46 Coptic Christians killed in the Palm Sunday massacre brought about by twin jihadist bombings. [The Coptic Orthodox Diocese of Minya, located in southern Egypt, said Tuesday that commemorations of the Resurrection of Jesus will be limited to the liturgical prayers “without any festive manifestations” out of respect for the faithful who were slain by suicide bombers of the Islamic State.  The Minya province has the highest Coptic Christian population in the country and Christians there traditionally hold Easter Vigil services on Saturday evening and then spend Easter Sunday on large meals and family visits. Christians in Minya have lived in constant fear of attacks from the area’s large Salafi Muslim population. In certain local villages, the faithful celebrate Mass before a cross drawn on a wall, making it easy to erase quickly in order to avoid attacks. Police sources said that 28 people have been arrested for their possible ties to the planning and financing of Sunday’s attacks. Using DNA testing, authorities have also identified the two perpetrators of the slaughter as Egyptians who had traveled to Syria yet managed to return to Egypt, bypassing border controls. The two jihadis carried out separate suicide bombings in the churches of Saint George in Tanta and Saint Mark in Alexandria while Palm Sunday services were being conducted. The attacks took the lives of 46 people, and left more than a hundred wounded. One of the terrorists was identified with the nom de guerre of Abu Ishaaq al Masri, and was reportedly born in 1990 in the province of Sharqiya, located in the Nile delta north of Cairo. He is thought to have entered Syria in January of 2017 before authorities lost track of his whereabouts. The bombing in Alexandria was reportedly the work of Abu     who blew himself up near the doors of the church just as he passed through the metal detector. According to the man’s relatives, he had made several trips to neighboring Libya, where he would stay for three months at a time. On Tuesday, the Egyptian Parliament unanimously ratified the state of emergency that had been declared the prior evening by the cabinet of ministers of President Abdel Fattah  . The state of alert will be in force for the next three months, at which time it may be renewed if need be. The state of emergency gives the president wide and exceptional powers to establish special courts, intercept communications, impose censorship, or even decree a curfew. Human rights activists have expressed fears that the state of emergency will add even more repression to a country where public freedoms have been crushed in the last four years under the pretext of fighting increasingly widespread terrorism. The Pew Research Center reported Tuesday that Egypt is now the country with the highest level of government restrictions of religion in the entire world. Meanwhile, the Islamic State has become more and more active in Egypt, especially in the region of North Sinai, and recently vowed to step up its attacks against Egypt’s Christians. Along with the Palm Sunday attack, ISIS had claimed responsibility for the December 2016 bombing of a church next to St. Mark’s Cathedral in Cairo, an important religious site for Egyptian Copts. That explosion killed 30 Christians and injured dozens more. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter  Follow @tdwilliamsrome",0

20508,20508,LEAKED AUDIO: HILLARY CLINTON PROPOSED RIGGING PALESTINIAN ELECTION,Aaron Kesel,"We Are Change 
Leaked audio from 2006, shows Hillary Clinton suggesting that the U.S. should have rigged a foreign countries electoral process. Eyebrows should be raised high to your forehead when hearing Clinton suggest the U.S. should have “made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win” rigging the Palestinian election. The leak comes less then a week away from when voters take to the polls.
“I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.” 
~Hillary Clinton, 2006, said. 
The audio was leaked to the Observer , by Eli Chomsky who was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press at the time. Chomsky recorded Hillary speaking to the Jewish Press January, 25, 2006 about the second Palestinian Legislative Council on an old cassette tape.
Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).

Chomsky held onto the tape all these years and was told by his bosses at the time in 2006, that they didn’t think it was “newsworthy” at the time. Chomsky also expressed that the Jewish Press had a mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody in a position of influence.
“I went to my bosses at the time, the Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody even a direct quote from anyone in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn’t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.”
Given the absurd amount of primary fraud in favor of Hillary Clinton this should open another Pandora’s box.
The potential that she may knowingly have setup the election fraud so she could win against Senator Bernie Sanders. The collusion with the DNC, the media and the dirty tactics used by her campaign and the Democrats in general that Project Veritas exposed . With a statement like that in 2006, Hillary may have known about all the illegal practices taking part now in the U.S. 2016 election cycle making her a direct participant in the conspiracy. Whether it’s violating FEC regulations, criminal laws, morals or ethics. Hillary doesn’t care that’s what this tape shows it shows the further moral depravity of a presidential candidate less then 2 weeks away from the election. It shows that Hillary doesn’t give a damn about democracy even in a foreign country where the U.S. has no business meddling in other countries internal election affairs. And here she is suggesting that the U.S. should have “made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.”
Hillary has proven time and time again that she has absolutely no conscience what so ever. Whether it’s lying about Bosnia snipers or lying about her email investigation, lying about Benghazi, or having a public and private opinion on issues directly deceiving voters Hillary has shown what difference does it make? Here’s Hillary lying for 14 minutes straight and that’s not even counting the lies she told to the American people while making deals with Goldman Sachs, Wall St and foreign donors.

20509,20509,"In Wake of Orlando Shootings, Mexican Soccer Chant Offends Many - The New York Times",Randal C. Archibold,"The Mexican soccer star Javier Hernández, known as Chicharito, has condemned it in a public service announcement. Hashtags have spread to raise awareness of its offensiveness and to try to put an end to it. And after the massacre in an Orlando nightclub popular with gay Latinos, commentators have urged fans to abandon it once and for all. But still, as is customary when the Mexican national team is playing in an international tournament, it could be heard: the roar of “Eeeh   …     puto!” by Mexican fans trying to distract the opposing goalkeeper punting the ball upfield. “Puto,” roughly translated as “male prostitute,” is a slur often hurled at gay men in Mexico, but fans who chant it say they use it out of the more generalized meaning of “coward” (or, in the adjective form, simply an unpleasant thing). On Monday, two days after a gunman killed 49 people in Orlando, Fla. including at least four Mexican nationals, the chant could be heard during Mexico’s match against Venezuela in Houston during the Copa América regional tournament, being held in the United States for the first time. Some people even believe they heard it chanted with a little more gusto, as if in defiance over the criticism of the term. Mexico’s national team was fined $20, 700 in January by FIFA, the world soccer body, over fans’ use of the chant in a World Cup qualifying game against El Salvador in November. In theory, FIFA could move to take away points in the World Cup standings, which could derail the team’s advancement to the 2018 finals. On Thursday, without mentioning Mexico, Concacaf, the governing body for soccer in North and Central America and the Caribbean, issued a statement denouncing “chants or actions that are derogatory or offensive” and said that “they must be stopped. ” It did not mention what action, if any, it would take. Mexico next plays on Saturday night in a Copa América quarterfinal match against Chile at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. In Mexico, the chant is largely seen as much ado about nothing, and penalizing the team over it a sign of political correctness. Luis Fernando Lara, the editor of the Diccionario del español de Mexico (Dictionary of Mexican Spanish) said in an interview that the word derives from a Latin root that means “child. ” In its feminine form, it came to mean “prostitute,” and its male form took that meaning as well, particularly in the gay community. It evolved to mean “coward” or “ . ” In soccer matches, he said, it is intended simply to insult the goalkeeper, not to call him gay. “It seems to me that FIFA is wrong in judging the shout as an insult to homosexuals,” he said. “It is indeed an insult, but it is not aimed at the gay community. I think unfortunately they are making a cause out of the shout all through a politically incorrect mistake. ” Many gay advocates consider such reasoning nonsense. “The whole point is that the choice of this word is absolutely linked to a negative, homophobic meaning,” said Enrique Torre Molina, a Mexican who is campaign manager at All Out, an international gay rights organization. “‘Puto’ is the word many gay men have been called in school or even by family members to mock us or put us down. ‘Puto’ is the word many gay men hear as they’re being beaten, sometimes to death, in the daily homophobic crimes committed in Latin America. ”’ ”He added: “What is kind of infuriating, especially after tragedies like the Orlando shooting and any other homophobic crime that happens, is to read and hear people refusing to let it go after having so many gay men literally asking for them to drop it. If you have a group of people saying, ’Hey, when you use this word, it hurts,’ why not drop it? ”” ’Some fans are trying to do just that. Sergio Tristan, a   and the founder of Pancho Villa’s Army, an Austin, Tex.  fan club for the Mexican team, said the group had tried to persuade the “vocal minority” backing the chant to drop it. Tristan said that he had once chanted it too but that he had eventually acknowledged that it was offensive and not worth the penalties that have been or could be imposed on the team. He said the vitriol directed by American fans offended by the chat could actually backfire. “They actually are making it worse,” he said, pointing to the perceived louder volume of the chant at recent matches. “It’s a Mexican problem that should be solved by Mexican fans. ” He added: “Whether or not it is offensive, it really is a matter of perspective. We want to stop it because we are at the juncture where our team could suffer fines or lose points in our World Cup spot. ”",0

20511,20511,Video Shows Texas Dem Encouraging ’Sanctuary’ Protesters from House Floor,Bob Price,"A new video captures a Texas Democrat encouraging protest disruptions from the floor of the State House of Representatives last week. The video was taken moments before the   confrontation between Republican Rep. Matt Rinaldi ( ) and Hispanic Democrat legislators. [The cell phone video taken from the floor of the Texas House by State Representative Mark Keough (  Woodlands) shows Democrat State Representative Ramon Ramero (  Worth) chanting “Hey, Hey. Ho, Ho. SB4 has got to go!” House rules and order prohibit such behavior by representatives.   “This is such an embarrassment for the legislature,” Rep. Keough told Breitbart Texas in an exclusive interview. “The people in the gallery were holding up signs saying they are in the country illegally, and Democrat state reps are cheering them on. ” “We all took the same oath to uphold and defend the Constitutions of Texas and the United States at the beginning of the session,” the Republican representative continued. “And here they were, encouraging lawless behavior. ” Keough told Breitbart Texas that House rules expressly prohibit this type of conduct. “Unfortunately, the House    and other security personnel were upstairs in the gallery dealing with the disruptive crowd,” he explained. “When the Speaker calls for order, you are supposed to settle down, but they just continued encouraging the crowd. I couldn’t believe it. ” The chants from protesters came after the House Speaker had ordered Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers to clear the House Gallery of protesters who were attempting to disrupt the final day of the legislative session. Romero and other Democrat state representatives were seen by their Republican colleagues as egging on the protesters while law enforcement officers tried to maintain peace and order. State Representative Jonathan Stickland ( ) told Breitbart Texas that at this point when the video by Keough was filmed, several DPS troopers had been assaulted and pushed down the steps in the gallery by the crowd. “These troopers were trying to restore order, and Democrats were egging them on from the floor,” Stickland said. “I have never seen anything like this in the House. ” Rinaldi would later accuse Romero of physically assaulting him after he told Democrat reps he had called ICE on the protesters claiming to be illegal aliens. “When I told the Democrats I called ICE, Representative Ramon Romero physically assaulted me, and other Democrats were held back by colleagues,” Rinaldi posted on Facebook. This session has seen the passage of historic, but emotional legislation relating to prohibiting sanctuary cities in Texas. Senate Bill 4, authored by Senator Charles Perry ( ) is now the law of the state. The law which prohibits sheriff’s and police chiefs from ignoring immigration detainers and having policies forbidding officers from asking about immigration status becomes effective on September 1, 2017. The bill provides civil fines and even criminal penalties to law enforcement officials choosing to ignore immigration authorities. This new law was the focus of protesters on the final day of the session. The emotional debate over the bill left emotional scars on relationships between representatives with opposing viewpoints. In a few weeks, the legislature will reconvene in a special session called by Governor Greg Abbott on July 18.

Deze kunnen de uitwisselingen omvatten over illegale financieringen of corruptie, andere over de banden tussen de eega’s Clinton en de Moslimbroederschap en de jihadisten.
Voltaire Netwerk | Damascus (Syrië) | 6 november 2016 ελληνικά English Español français Türkçe русский Deutsch Português italiano norsk عربي Hillary Clinton en haar kabinetschef Huma Abedin. De heractivering van de FBI enquête in de privé e-mails van Hillary Clinton betreffen niet meer de veiligheidsregels, maar de manipulaties die kunnen gaan tot hoogverraad.
Technisch, in plaats de beveiligde server van de Federale Staat te gebruiken, had de Staatssecretaresse in haar woning een privé server laten installeren, om op die manier het internet te kunnen gebruiken zonder sporen op een machine van de Federale Staat achter te laten. De privé technicus van Mevr Clinton had haar server uitgewist vòòr de aankomst van de FBI, zodat het onmogelijk was te weten waarom zij dit dispositief had ingericht.
In het begin heeft de FBI geobserveerd dat de server niet de beveiliging van het State Department had. Mevr Clinton had dus slechts een veiligheidsfout begaan. Later heeft de FBI de computer van het vroegere congreslid Anthony Weiner in beslag genomen. Deze is de vroegere echtgenoot van Huma Abedin, kabinetschef van Hillary. Daarin zijn E-mails afkomstig van de Staatssecretaresse teruggevonden.
Anthony Weiner is een Joods politicus, heel intiem bevriend met de Clintons, die ambieerde burgemeester van New York te worden. Hij moest ontslag nemen als gevolg van een zeer puriteinse schandaal: hij had per SMS erotische berichten naar een andere jonge vrouw dan zijn echtgenote gestuurd. Huma Abedin scheidde officieel van hem tijdens deze agitatie, maar verliet hem in werkelijkheid niet.
Huma Abedin is een Amerikaanse opgevoed in Saoedi-Arabië. Haar vader dirigeert een academische revue —waar ze gedurende jaren redactiesecretaresse van was— die regelmatig de mening van de Moslimbroederschap reproduceert. Haar moeder presideert de Saoedische vereniging van de vrouwelijke leden van de Moslimbroederschap en werkte samen met de vrouw van de Egyptische president Mohamed Morsi. Haar broer Hassan werkt voor de sjeik Yusuf al-Qaradawi, prediker van de Broederschap en geestelijke adviseur van Al-Jazeera.
Ter gelegenheid van een officiële reis naar Saoedi-Arabië bezoekt de Staatssecretaresse het college Dar al-Hekma in het bijzijn van Salehan Abedin (moeder van haar kabinetschef), presidente van de vereniging van de Zusters leden van de Broederschap. Huma Abedin is heden een centraal personage van Clinton’s verkiezingscampagne, naast John Podesta, vroegere secretaris-generaal van het Witte-Huis tijdens het presidentschap van Bill Clinton. Daarnaast is Podesta de vaste lobbyist van het Saoedische koninkrijk in het Amerikaanse Congres voor de bescheiden som van 200.000 dollar maandelijks. Op 12 juni 2016 had Petra, het officiële persbureau van Jordanië, een interview gepubliceerd van de Arabische prins Ben Salmane, die pochte over de moderniteit van zijn familie die illegaal 20% van de presidentscampagne van Hillary Clinton had gefinancierd, hoewel dat een vrouw is. De dag na de publicatie annuleerde het agentschap dit bericht, verzekerend dat zijn site gepirateerd was.
Volgens het officiële Jordaanse persbureau Petra van 12 juni 2016 heeft de Saoedische koninklijke familie illegaal 20% van de verkiezingscampagne van Hillary Clinton gefinancierd. Mevr Abedin is niet het enige lid van de Obama administratie die aan de Broederschap verbonden is. De half-broer van de president, Abon’go Malik Obama, is de schatmeester van het Missiewerk van de Broeders in Soedan en president van de Stichting Barack H. Obama. Hij staat rechtstreeks onder bevel van de Soedanese president Omar el-Béchir. Een Moslimbroeder is lid van de Nationale Veiligheidsraad —de hoogste uitvoerende instantie van de Verenigde Staten—. Van 2009 tot 2012 was dit het geval van Mehdi K. Alhassani. Men weet niet wie hem heeft opgevolgd maar het Witte-Huis ontkende dat een Broeder lid was van de Raad tot er een bewijs van opdook. Het is ook een Broeder die ambassadeur van de Verenigde Staten is bij de Islamitische conferentie, Rashad Hussain. De andere geïdentificeerde Broeders bezetten minder belangrijke posten. HLouay M. Safi moet echter worden genoemd, huidig lid van de Nationale Syrische Coalitie en vorig adviseur van het Pentagon.
President Obama en zijn half-broer Abon’go Malik Obama in het Ovaal Bureau. Abon’go Malik is de schatmeester van het Missiewerk van de Moslimbroeders in Soedan. In April 2009, twee maanden voor zijn redevoering in Caïro, had president Obama in het geheim een delegatie van de Broederschap ontvangen in het Ovaal Bureau. Hij had, voor zijn inhuldiging Ingrid Mattson, presidente van de vereniging van de Moslim Broeders en Zusters in de Verenigde Staten, al uitgenodigd.
Van zijn kant heeft de Stichting Clinton voor zijn project « klimaat » als verantwoordelijke Gehad el-Haddadin in dienst genomen, één van de wereldleiders van de Broederschap, die tot dan toe verantwoordelijke was van een televisie uitzending over de Koran. Zijn vader was één van de mede-oprichters van de Broederschap, in 1951; tijdens de her-oprichting door de CIA en de MI6 heeft Gehad de Stichting in 2012 verlaten, op welke datum hij in Caïro de woordvoerder van kandidaat Mohammed Morsi is geworden, en vervolgens die van de Moslimbroeders, op mondiaal niveau.
Er van uitgaande dat de totaliteit van de jihadisten-leiders in de wereld voortkomen uit hetzij de Broederschap, hetzij uit de orde van de Soefi’s van de Naqshbandîs —de twee componenten van de Islamitische liga, de Arabisch-Saoedische anti-nationalistische organisatie— zou men wel meer willen weten over de relaties tussen Mevr Clinton en Saoedi-Arabië en de Broeders.
Het is trouwens zo dat in het team van haar tegenstander Donald Trump zich generaal T. Flynn bevindt, die poogde zich tegen de creatie van het Kalifaat door het Witte-Huis te verzetten en ontslag nam van de directie van de Defense Intelligence Agency (Militaire Inlichtingendienst) om zijn afwijzing te markeren. Hij gaat hier om met Frank Gaffney, een vroegere « Koude oorlog strijder »,voortaan bestempeld als een « complottist » voor de aanwezigheid van Broeders in de Verenigde Staten te hebben aangeklaagd.
Het spreekt vanzelf dat, vanuit het standpunt van de FBI steun aan jihadistische organisaties een misdaad is, wat ook de politiek van de CIA mag zijn. In 1991 had de politie —en senator Kelly— het failliet van de Pakistaanse (hoewel in de Caymaneilanden geregistreerde) bank BCCI geprovoceerd, welke de CIA voor allerlei geheime operaties met zowel de Moslimbroeders als met de latino-amerikaanse drugskartels gebruikte.

20514,20514,"Quebec Mosque Shooting Kills at Least 6, and 2 Suspects Are Arrested - The New York Times",Ian Austen and Craig S. Smith,"OTTAWA  —   Gunmen opened fire in a mosque in the city of Quebec on Sunday night, killing six people and wounding eight others in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called a “terrorist attack on Muslims. ” Étienne Doyon, a spokesman for the Quebec police, told reporters at the scene that the attack on the mosque, the Islamic Cultural Center of Quebec, had occurred around 8 p. m. At a news conference early Monday the police confirmed the six fatalities and said that two suspects had been arrested. The attack shook Canada, a country where mass shootings are uncommon, and came as the country has become known as a beacon for refugees fleeing warfare and terrorism in   nations. Mr. Trudeau assailed what he called “this terrorist attack on Muslims in a center of worship and refuge. ” “It is   to see such senseless violence,” he said in a statement early Monday. “Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear. ” Christine Colombe, a spokeswoman for the Quebec Provincial Police, said the victims ranged in age from 35 to 70 and said that 39 people who were in the mosque were not hurt. The police had not yet identified a motive in the shootings, saying the investigation was just beginning. Ms. Colombe said that one of the two suspects was arrested at the scene of the shooting, while another was apprehended nearby on Île d’Orleans. The police said that some of those wounded in the shooting were seriously hurt. On Twitter, Martin Coiteux, the provincial minister of public safety, said that “the police systems for dealing with terrorist acts have been activated” in the wake of the shooting. “Ensuring the safety of the population is our priority,” he wrote.   the   service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, said the area surrounding the mosque had been sealed off by the police after the attack. Last June, a pig’s head was left at the door of the mosque in the middle of Ramadan. Practicing Muslims regard pork as unclean and do not eat it. The president of the mosque, Mohamed Yangui, was interviewed on Ici RDI, a French Canadian broadcaster. He was not at the mosque during the shooting but said that people who were present had told him that one gunman was able to reload his weapon several times. He said he had been told by witnesses that the gunmen had entered on the ground floor and had gone to the second floor where women pray, but he did not know whether any women were in the mosque at the time. The attack came after Mr. Trudeau said that Canada stood ready to continue welcoming refugees from terrorism and war and as President Trump’s executive order on immigration stranded people around the world and provoked condemnation that it was directed at Muslims. In the wake of the Quebec shooting, the New York City police stepped up protection of mosques, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter. About 765, 000 people live in the city of Quebec, and 6, 760 of them identified themselves as Muslims during the last national census. Mr. Trudeau posted a message on Twitter on Saturday welcoming refugees to Canada and included a photograph of himself with a child under the hashtag #WelcomeToCanada. Since Mr. Trudeau took office in late 2015 the country has admitted nearly 40, 000 refugees, many of them fleeing the war in Syria. Canada’s warm embrace of Syrian refugees has won the country accolades at home and abroad, but is not without its domestic opponents. A survey in Ontario last summer found that while there was widespread support for accepting the refugees, only a third of respondents had a positive impression of Islam, and more than half felt its mainstream doctrines promoted violence.   incidents have been on the rise in Canada, with several minor incidents reported in Quebec during the past year. A Montreal mosque and a   Muslim community center were slightly damaged in separate arson attempts in December, and the head of the Association of Muslims and Arabs for a Secular Quebec received online death threats the month before. The increasing tension led a member of Parliament, Iqra Khalid, to put forward a motion in the national House of Commons in December calling on the government to condemn Islamophobia and request a study on how the government could combat the trend. The motion will probably be voted on when the House returns to session this week. In the wake of Sunday night’s attack, the premier of the province of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, said that solidarity rallies were planned on Monday for people to express their concern about the shootings. “We are with you. You are at home,” he said, in words directed at the province’s Muslim residents.",0
20515,20515,Learning to Speak for the Dead - The New York Times,Winnie Hu,"The dead man waited on a gurney. His corpulent frame, after days of decomposing, had turned the mottled green of a ripe watermelon. He had been found alone in bed in his Manhattan apartment, surrounded by an avalanche of discarded bottles and trash. Now Dr. Jacqueline Nunez was by his side. As a medical examiner training in New York City, she had the job of finding out what had happened to him. It would not be quick or easy, not like television crime shows in which deaths are neatly wrapped up in under an hour. The job requires examiners to break apart bodies: hard physical work.   too. Dr. Nunez would be on her feet for hours, splattered by blood and other body fluids, at times breathing an unimaginable stench. She could spend weeks, or even months, piecing together clues that might never add up. Standing on top of a metal stool, Dr. Nunez cut into the torso. A thick greenish fluid oozed out. She grabbed an   ladle to scoop out more of it. Then she stuck both hands into the body to feel around for the liver. She came up empty, her gloves dripping. “Oh, what a mess,” she said. “I’m not sure what’s going on. This is the worst I’ve ever seen. ” It got messier. Dr. Nunez cracked open the chest with clippers to remove the heart and the lungs. She cut out the intestines. Then, as a whirring electric saw was used to open the skull, Dr. Nunez reached in to lift out the brain. When she was finished, she cleaned up. Then she started on her next patient. DR. NUNEZ is part of a New York City fellowship program that has become one of the country’s most renowned training grounds for medical examiners. The Forensic Pathology Fellows Program has helped resurrect a   agency, the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, which as recently as the 1980s was widely accused of incompetent management and bias toward the police. The estimated 500 forensic pathologists working nationwide are roughly half the number needed, according to the National Association of Medical Examiners. “Everyone who passes the medical examiner’s boards is sought after,” said Dr. David Fowler, the association’s president, who attributed the shortage to limited training opportunities and relatively low compensation compared with the pay that pathologists receive at hospitals or in private practice. Since 1990, the New York fellowship program has trained 100 medical examiners. The program has bolstered the agency’s status as a national model for medical examiner’s offices and has been the source of a new generation of forensic experts, producing the current or former chief medical examiners in more than 20 jurisdictions, including Washington, San Francisco, Honolulu and the States of Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont. Since the program is based in New York, the city is somewhat insulated from the shortage elsewhere in the country. Dr. Nunez, 34, is one of five doctors who have spent the past year preparing to become medical examiners. A cheerful woman who favors large gold hoop earrings, she is often mistaken for a schoolteacher. She grew up in Amityville, on Long Island, the older of two children of a landscape worker and a homemaker, and she went to medical school in the Dominican Republic. Instead of a black doctor’s bag, she carries a   Craftsman toolbox packed with knives, scalpels, forceps and scissors. She does not mind working on bodies, not even one that is decomposing, known as a “decomp,” which is often the least favorite case for medical examiners. “A lot of people  —   especially other physicians and other pathologists  —   used to tell me, ‘I would have loved to have done forensics, but I can’t deal with the decomp,’” she said. “I actually have no problem doing them, and one of the reasons is because I feel like I’m the last person that is going to be providing some kind of care, bridging their death and their life. I’m the last person. ” NEW YORK CITY’S Office of Chief Medical Examiner is based in a squat,   building, at 520 First Avenue, with letters missing from its name. Inside, a Latin inscription behind the reception desk translates to: “This is the place where the dead help the living. ” The medical examiners are the conduit for the two, providing answers, consoling grieving relatives and, if needed, informing police detectives. They fill a crucial but often overlooked role in a city where 5, 000 autopsies a year are performed for deaths that are deemed sudden or suspicious or are a result of crimes, accidents or suicides. It was medical examiners who sifted through the remains of more than 2, 700 victims after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. When there were no intact bodies, the pathologists had to improvise. They measured fingers to help identify people, using metal ring sizers that were donated in Tiffany’s little blue bags. That was also the year when Flight 587 crashed in Queens with 260 people aboard, and the year when envelopes laced with anthrax became a new terror threat. “When things get bad here, they get very bad,” said Dr. Barbara Sampson, who was appointed the city’s chief medical examiner in 2014. The agency’s staff of 600 includes 24 senior medical examiners, 20 of whom graduated from the fellowship program. The agency runs offices in every borough, three mortuaries and the country’s largest public DNA lab, along with other labs for toxicology, molecular genetics and histology, the microscopic examination of tissue. The agency’s $75 million annual budget is the equivalent of $8. 82 per city resident for the laboratories, investigations and other activities, far more than the national average of $3. 36 per resident, according to the National Association of Medical Examiners. Dr. Sampson, herself a 1998 fellow, says she looks for future medical examiners who can communicate and work well with others. The fellows, who have already graduated from medical school and completed a residency program in pathology, are selected after a   unpaid tryout. They receive a salary of $131, 566 for the academic year, which runs from July 1 through June. At the end, the fellows sit for a nationally administered board exam nearly everyone passes. Some will be offered permanent positions as senior medical examiners with annual salaries starting at $159, 741, or invited to continue as fellows for a second year to specialize in the pathology of the brain and the heart. In contrast, general pathologists at hospitals and in private practice typically earn $200, 000 or more. In total, there have been 58 women and 42 men in the program. About   are black, Hispanic or Asian. Many have foreign backgrounds. This year’s fellows include doctors who grew up in Croatia, Russia and Mexico. For some it is a calling. Dr. Stephen Melito, 32, went to medical school just so he could become a medical examiner. As a teenager in Farmingdale, on Long Island, he used to volunteer as an underage buyer of cigarettes in undercover police operations. For a high school class, he researched how to tell the time of death at a crime scene. Dr. Kanayo Tatsumi relocated to New York from Vermont less than a year after she was married. Her husband, a surgical resident, stayed behind to finish his training. Dr. Tatsumi, 33, was still in college when she interned at an Illinois coroner’s office. The first autopsy she observed was of a young woman killed in a car accident. She could not stop thinking about her. Had she been wearing a seatbelt? Had her airbag deployed? “It could have been me it could have been any of my friends,” Dr. Tatsumi recalled. “I started realizing that we could do a lot to prevent injuries, even though we’re getting that data, if you will, from death. ” THE MEDICAL EXAMINERS in training have desks side by side in Room 335  —   known as the fellows’ room  —   where a bulletin board is crammed with photos of fellows in hazmat suits, at parties and holding babies. They alternate between “A” days for autopsies and “P” days for paperwork, while squeezing in lectures on topics like firearm injuries,   trauma and pediatric deaths. They go to crime scenes, rotate through the labs and learn to handle infectious diseases like Ebola and respond to terror threats. The A days begin with an 8 a. m. triage meeting. Dr. Nunez stood behind a lectern, presenting case histories to senior medical examiners, forensic anthropologists, police detectives and medical students. There were 11 cases that day, not unusual in number or scope: An older man died after falling at home a younger man with a cocaine habit was found dead by his brother. Afterward, Dr. Nunez headed down to the mortuary. She checked the body bags in the hallway. “This is one of mine,” she called out to a technician. “This is another one. I’ve got one more. ” Her next stop was the autopsy room, which has eight stations, each equipped with a metal table and a scale. By 9:30 a. m. Dr. Nunez was at one of the stations, engrossed in her first case. A thin black man lay on the table. She removed his pancreas. It had dark spots where blood had pooled, a possible sign that he had spent a lot of time out in the cold before he died. Just before 11 a. m. she was ready for her next case. Dr. Nunez does not take breaks or stop for lunch. “Once I get going, I just keep up the pace,” she said. “You build endurance, you pick up stamina and you get used to it. That’s what this year is for. ” Her scrubs were stained with blood and fluids. “I’m not squeamish about it at all anymore,” she said. At 3 p. m. Dr. Nunez was still working on her third autopsy when the other medical examiners reconvened to review their findings. She did not have much to report yet. “It happens,” she said. “I’d rather we look at everything and not rush through anything. ’’ Afterward, Dr. Nunez retreated to the fellows’ room to draft a report for each autopsy. She would order lab tests, interview relatives and consider other evidence before closing each case. Dr. Sampson reads every report. The fellowship program is the legacy of Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, the city’s chief medical examiner from 1989 to 2013, who was known to focus not only on technical skills but also on scientific integrity, common sense and compassion. “I still quote Dr. Hirsch two or three times a day,” said Dr. Susan Ely, a 1997 fellow who is now the program’s director. “His presence is still very much felt here. ” Dr. Hirsch, a former chief medical examiner for Suffolk County, was appointed in 1989 by Mayor Edward I. Koch, to lead an agency battered by conflict and mistrust. The mayor had fired the previous chief medical examiner, Dr. Elliot M. Gross, citing poor leadership and management. In 1985, Dr. Gross was accused by defense lawyers and forensic specialists of producing misleading or inaccurate autopsy findings in cases of people who died in police custody. A mayoral commission cleared him of wrongdoing but faulted a longstanding agency practice in which deaths in police custody were routinely left as undetermined. Though the medical examiner’s office is now considered professionally run and independent, it has not entirely escaped controversy. The agency has been challenged for using a highly sensitive technique to analyze trace samples of DNA  —   known as low copy number DNA testing  —   that has been criticized as unreliable. In February, a former toxicology lab director sued the city, claiming that she was forced out in part for raising questions about its use of the technique. EACH FELLOW is expected to complete about 250 autopsies, a goal based on national standards for training medical examiners. The sheer diversity of cases in a big city ensures that they see just about every kind of injury imaginable. Dr. Judy Melinek, who chronicled her fellowship experience in a 2014 memoir, “Working Stiff,” recalled that she was told to go to New York by a former fellow who noted, “All kinds of great ways to die there, and the teaching is brilliant. ” Dr. Rafael Garcia, 36, had barely started the fellowship program in July when he was assigned not only his first homicide but a double homicide. He spent seven hours working on just one of the victims, a man who had been stabbed 20 times. As it happened, he had attended a lecture on stab wounds the day before. Almost a year later, Dr. Garcia has completed 250 autopsies, of which about   have not been resolved. “It’s funny to see a TV show and how they do everything in the same day,” he said. “That’s not reality. ” Dr. Garcia, a father of two who grew up in Mexico and trained to be an ophthalmologist, said he had no regrets about switching to forensic pathology. “Money is important,” he said, “but I’d rather feel happy with what I’m doing than just being frustrated by an entire life doing something that I don’t enjoy as much. ” The fellows keep track of their autopsies in Excel spreadsheets that list the names of the dead, brief histories and findings. The most common deaths are accidental or natural the least common are undetermined in cause or manner of death, or both. At one point in February, when Dr. Nunez surpassed 150 autopsies, her fiancé, an accountant, figured that she needed to complete about 25 autopsies per month in the time left. In May, she surpassed 215 autopsies. By Tuesday, she was at 242. Though she tries to stay positive, Dr. Nunez said the cases can take an emotional toll. She tries to decompress by going out to dinner with her fiancé and spending time with their extended families. Still, she loses sleep. “I feel like I want to give them more than I can, and I know I can’t,” she said of the victims’ families. “Something the senior medical examiners tell me all the time is, ‘You’ve done a full, competent exam.’ There are limitations. You have to learn to become comfortable with limitations. ” The other fellows have ways of coping, too. Dr. Melito said he did not check the news at home in New Jersey, where he lives with his wife, Mary, a teacher, and their two young children. On hard days, he gets extra hugs. Dr. Tatsumi said she found herself crying a lot. In an autopsy, she will discover that someone did not die right away and probably felt pain or fear in the final moments. “That just destroys me,” she said. “I’m not very good at hiding things, and so I wear it on my sleeve I wear it on my face. ” The five medical examiners in training have been invited to stay on. All have accepted except for Dr. Melito, who is taking a job closer to home. In Dr. Sampson’s office, there are framed photos of every class of fellows on graduation day  —   the counterpart of the informal collage upstairs in the fellows’ room. Nearly all of these smiling group shots are arranged in neat columns running down one wall. “This side is all Dr. Hirsch,” Dr. Sampson said. She pointed across the room, where there are just two photos of the last two fellows’ classes. “And that’s my wall,” she said. “Hopefully, it will be long someday. ” A photo of Dr. Nunez’s class will soon be added. Even in medical school, Dr. Nunez said, she was interested in the cause of a disease more than the treatment. A doctor would be poring over a patient’s lab work while “all I’m thinking is, I really wish I could take a piece of this woman’s lung to see what’s happening. ” Dr. Nunez said that she still wanted those answers, but that now her desire was to serve the families left behind. “I think that’s definitely what drew me the most,” she said. “It’s being able to be useful, and bring closure to families, and give them answers that they otherwise weren’t going to have. ”",0
20516,20516,‘What if You Weren’t Afraid?’ and 4 More Money Questions From Readers - The New York Times,Ron Lieber,"  mothers.   fathers. Disapproving elders. Parents who warn about regrets. Others whose financial limits were a statement of their values. A week ago, I asked you to send me the best questions you’ve ever asked, or answered, about money, and published seven queries to start the conversation. Of the five best new ones that arrived in the last week, every one came with a story about a parent like the ones described above. This shouldn’t come as an enormous surprise. After all, what we spend, save and give says a lot about who we are. Value and values are just a letter apart, and given how much influence our parents often have on the latter, it makes perfect sense that we think of them when we ponder our financial situations as well. So consider the following five questions, or adapt them to your own financial forks in the road as needed. And if your parents are alive, ask them, too, though you may already know what they will say. Where are we staying in Florida? When Jan Even was in second grade in River Forest, Ill. many of her classmates discussed their pending spring break plans. Some were going to Fort Lauderdale. Others were headed to Sarasota. “I just kind of thought that we were going, too, and that my parents hadn’t told me yet,” she recalled. But they weren’t going, and when she asked about the family’s destination, here’s how her mother replied: It’s more important for you to be able to go to college at age 18 than it is for us to go to Florida now. Ms. Even’s family had enough money that this wasn’t a   so much as a conscious choice. Both her parents grew up during the Depression, and her mother told stories of people coming to the back door of their farmhouse looking for food and Ms. Even’s grandmother feeding them dinner. Children make many assumptions about their lives and the lives of others based on where we choose to raise them. So you can’t fault Ms. Even, who is now 66 and lives in Redmond, Ore. for wondering aloud when she was young. Nor can you fault her parents for enforcing a bit of artificial deprivation. “Maybe they really were concerned about the money, but I think it was more an expression of their values,” she said. They did eventually take her to Florida  —   but not until senior year in high school, when the college fund was safe and she was six months away from starting at Northwestern University. Can you accept the fact that we can’t live the same life that you do? Plenty of parents hope that their children will climb at least one rung up the social class ladder once they are adults, and many more will fight hard to keep their children from slipping even a bit. So it can be jarring for parents when their adult children don’t strive for the same things they do. A reader in Baton Rouge, La. who did not want to use her name because she didn’t think her relatives would appreciate her sharing the story publicly, wrote in to describe the pressure she and her husband once felt to buy and spend and own and live the way that other, more established family members did. They ran up credit card debt before realizing they couldn’t keep up and didn’t really want to, either. Then, they had to gently explain to their family how they felt. “Sometimes, I think it’s easier to talk about sex with your parents than money,” she told me via email. “We choose a simple life. Experiences over possessions. ” Her note reminded me of one of the most haunting things I’ve ever read about families and money. In her book “A Wealth of Possibilities,” Ellen Miley Perry described the “centrifugal force” of abundance that swirls around financially successful families. And she described an acquaintance who summed up her relationship with her father this way: “He can’t accept the smallness of my dreams. ” What would you do if you weren’t afraid? In 2001, Daniel L. Anderson and his family were living in Reno, Nev. and loving the easy access to the outdoors, the low cost of living and the good schools. But he was slowly growing bored with his real estate job. He posted his résumé online and soon had a promising job offer in Houston. He also sought advice from his old mentor, who eventually offered him a different job in San Francisco, and then put that pointed question to Mr. Anderson when he wavered. The Houston company had a reputation as a terrific place to work. The word on the San Francisco employer was much more mixed. “His question caused me to   my situation to make sure I wasn’t doing what was easy and comfortable,” Mr. Anderson recalled, adding that he had to get over a bit of macho denial about his own fear before he could really think it through. There were also the stories his mother told him about all of her retired friends who talked about their regrets over the roads not taken. “I did not want to be that person,” he said. Which is how he ended up moving to Walnut Creek, Calif. where his family thrived. And how he turned down the attractive offer from a company called Enron. What good is having a lot in the bank if you’ve never let yourself live? Lisa and Janice Woolery both grew up in   families that didn’t have much money, and in their life together as a couple, they have been fairly careful. There is no mortgage on their home in Des Moines, and they’ve saved money for retirement. “But when you do some of those rather extensive retirement planning programs online, you just feel defeated,” Lisa said. “You start saying, ‘I’m going to die someday, and I want to live in a way that lets me do things that I have been putting off. ’” For the two of them, both 55, that means travel of the sort that might have felt fiscally irresponsible in previous years. New Zealand is high on their list. In an interview this week, I asked Lisa whether they’d been able to answer their big question in a way that had allowed them to put a trip like that on the calendar. “Not in the next year or two, yet,” she said. “But. ” Then a long pause. “It’s a   …    ” Then a deep sigh. “The safe answer is the answer I know to use,” she said finally. “Low to no risk. But at what point do you say that low to no risk isn’t living?” As I was writing this column, she followed up with an email. They’d booked a couples getaway to San Francisco, a place that holds fond memories for them from travel earlier in their relationship. It’s a good start. What is the most satisfying thing you’ve spent money on? By the time she’d scraped her way through college and graduate school, Trudelle Thomas recognized that she had inherited some heavy generational baggage from the Great Depression. So Ms. Thomas, an English professor at Xavier University, went to work on herself to see if she could derive more joy from the money that she chose to spend. When she finally persuaded herself to buy a new car, she didn’t draw much additional satisfaction from it. Nice meals out were often unhealthy and expensive. What she enjoyed much more, however, was the money she spent on and with others. She tithes and has contributed to the National Alliance on Mental Illness for a long enough period to feel as if she has been part of important policy changes. Another regular habit: taking her students, many of whom could not afford it, out for lunch in the campus cafeteria. And a few years ago, she took a niece, who otherwise might not have been able to travel, on a trip to California. She liked to dote on people, as she put it, and she reminded me that “thrive” is the root word of thrift. “My niece could think of me as her rich aunt,” she said. “But I want her to think of me as her thrifty aunt who splurges on her. ”",0
20517,20517,Club Soda for Stomach Pain and Constipation,Michael Greger M.D. FACLM,"Club Soda for Stomach Pain and Constipation VN:F [1.9.22_1171] Close Transcript Transcript: Club Soda for Stomach Pain and Constipation 
Below is an approximation of this video’s audio content. To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video. 
“Natural bubbling or sparkling mineral waters have been popular for thousands of years.” Manufactured sparkling water has been around ever since a clergyman “suspended water over a vat of fermenting beer.”“For centuries, carbonated water has been considered capable of relieving gastrointestinal symptoms,” including tummy aches, but we didn’t have good data until this study was published. 
“Twenty-one folks with dyspepsia [an upset stomach] and constipation were randomized into two groups in a double-blind fashion” to drink one-and-a-half quarts of carbonated water versus tap water, every day for two weeks. Dyspepsia was defined as “pain or discomfort located in the upper abdomen,” including “bloating and nausea.” 
And, carbonated water improved dyspepsia, compared to still water (tap water), and improved constipation. “Drink more water” is a common recommendation for constipation, but they didn’t observe a clear benefit of the added tap water. Seems you need to increase fiber and water, rather than just water alone. But, sparkling water seemed to help. Now they were using sparkling mineral water. And so, whether these effects are due to the bubbles or minerals, we can’t tell from this study. 
There’s been a concern that carbonated beverages may increase heartburn, GERD (acid reflux disease). But that was based on studies like this, that compared water to Pepsi. Soda can put the Pepsi in dyspepsia, and contribute to heartburn. But, so may tea and coffee, in people that suffer from heartburn. That may be partly from the cream and sugar, though, since milk is a common contributor to heartburn, as well. Carbonated water alone, though, shouldn’t be a problem. 
Similarly, while flavored sparkling drinks can erode our enamel, it’s not the carbonation, but the added juices and acids. Sparkling water alone appears a hundred times less erosive than citrus or soda. So, a sparkling mineral water may successfully treat stomachache and constipation without adverse effects—unless you’re a teenage boy opening a bottle of sparkling wine with your teeth, especially on a hot day after you shake it up, placing one at risk for a “pneumatic rupture of the esophagus.” Please consider volunteering to help out on the site.

I’m trying to find ways for the videos to be more engaging than just showing study after study, but there may be a fine line between engaging and dorky :-). The goal is to widen the appeal to reach more people, without distracting from the scientific rigor. What do you think?

Are the “rock” minerals in these mineral waters absorbable by humans? It is my understanding that the minerals in water are, basically, little pieces of rock, and our body can not utilize them. Maybe they even cause harm? A lot of debate on this one, but proponents of water low in TDS (total dissolved solids) often claim that the minerals in food are of absorbable nature, yet with the mineral it water it is just picking up pieces of rock and residue from the streams, lakes, etc. Makes me wonder about possible bogus benefits of consuming minerals through pure sea salts. Wegan 
Apparently they are absorbed.“On its website, the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) states that there is no connection between the carbonation in soft drinks and bone loss and that certain carbonated mineral waters (the ones rich in calcium and those that are more alkaline) have actually been shown to improve bone health.”Feb 18, 2013 stephaniehope

I like to see your face, and I think it personalises the whole thing. I like any info – articles are good, too, and they give you time to digest the content. (No pun intended.) Yes, changing things up from time to time is good, as long as the content is easy to understand and the links are visible – or placed under the video. And thank you a thousand times for your service to people. Julie 
I’d like to see him at the end–maybe sending us off with a witty joke. Ellie Lee-wasson 
I have been consuming at least a tablespoon of flax a day and following Dr. Gregor’s daily dozen recommendations, yet am still constipated and am having difficulty losing weight, which is a secondary goal of mine. Can anyone offer additional suggestions? EquaYona 
So you are on a plant based diet and constipated? How long have you been plant based? Do you still consume dairy? Ellie Lee-wasson 
I have been vegan for 4 years, have been eating whole food plant based for about 3 months, previously consuming larger amounts of processed vegan foods. I only “go” at most every couple days. EquaYona 
Can you increase your water consumption? Exercise is also an important factor for regularity. Are you following the exercise recommendations in the daily dozen? If you are getting plenty of fluids and exercise, you might try adding a little more fat(nuts, avocado) and try a bran cereal for breakfast or snack. It is startling that you have such a problem on a vegan, whole food diet. I generally have two BMs a day. Ellie Lee-wasson 
I try to drink about 64 ounces of water or tea a day, but, I also work in aviation. I walk about 10000 steps a day, and try to get additional cardiovascular as my job allows. But, yes, I agree it is startling, unfortunately, my current situation is a vast improvement from when I was not eating vegan. susan 
hi Ellie, I can’t add much to the excellent suggestions of EquaYona, other than to mention two things that helped me. I use 1 tbsp ground flax in my oatmeal in the mornings, but, if having issues, 1 tbsp in 1/4 cup water last thing at night before bed works wonders. The other thing is to avoid gluten free bread products if you use them at all.. I find one slice of this ‘bread’ at lunch with salad very effective. Best of luck 
http://www.mannaorganicbakery.com/item/organic-sprouted-bread-banana-walnut-hemp.html maggie 
Hi Ellie, I can suggest brown rice, beans and steamed broccoli or kale. These are hi fiber foods, sweet potatoes especially the Japanese purple potato are great has well. Bean soups are great as well. I suspect you are not getting hi fiber foods during the day. I’m pretty regular with 2 BM a day Cheryl esben andersen 
I would disagree with you . I do not think it is a lack of fiber since the person is already on a whole foods diet . It is a lack of peristalsis of the digestive tract , the contraction and relaxation of the digestive tract which moves the food or more correctly the waste products along . 2 or 3 glasses of water at body temperature first thing in the morning has helped a lot of people according to our naturepathic doctor we go too. For still sluggish movement sauerkraut juice or sauerkraut has helped the most stubborn cases . Darla Eaves 
Black coffee esben andersen 
Took me a while to go from creamer in my coffee to black , oh yeah a lot of people I know swear by their coffee. Ellie Lee-wasson 
I only drink black coffee :) susan 
yes esben I agree with the peristalsis idea.. I was given buscopan for gall bladder pain, nausea etc, but then later with continuing issues I was given Domperidone to speed up the digestive process. I then felt a lot better. The coffee is definitly necessary though. I will give the sauerkraut a try too. thank you! Jean 
I have a sluggish digestive tract caused in part by injuries to nerves and muscles; also migraine can slow down and sometimes even stop gut activity. When it doesn’t want to work properly nothing makes a difference. WFPB has made it less of a problem but there still are spells. Rebecca Cody 
Your problem is much more extreme than mine, but this works for me: I put 1 tablespoon of chia seeds in about a cup of water every morning, stir and then leave it sitting on the counter for about 10 minutes. Then, not before, add a rounded teaspoon of magnesium citrate powder. I use one called Natural Calm, which is available in health food stores. Stir it up well, add a bit of stevia if you wish, and drink it down. I used to do the same thing an hour or so after dinner at night, but it was definitely overkill, so I dropped the evening dose. Andrea Reiman

Hi, Ellie Lee-Wesson, I noticed there are lots of helpful advice regarding your issue with constipation even though you are on PBWF. You mentioned you are in aviation, does your job entails traveling on plane and being on high altitude? Because that could be the issue since going on high altitute causes dehydration a lot. Hydrating 20 minutes before meal and one hour after meal.The suggestions of chia seeds, flax seed, psyllum and magnisum and dissolving in warm water are very good. Also pineapple juice, prune juice also 1 table spoon good extra virgin olive oil and coffee tend to help with the bowel movement. Also having fruit one hour before meal or two hours after meal can be helpful. Ellie Lee-wasson 
Yes, I am on planes 12-14 hours a day most days. I do drink a lot of water, both still and sparkling (as mentioned in the video). I do also drink a lot of black coffee. Do you have any suggestions for fruit that packs well for travel that I could bring with me on the plane? Or other good fibre rich foods that I could pack and can be eaten raw or in a microwave? Foroogh – NF Moderator 
I would suggest dried organic figs and prunes and raisins in a little bag. Also what I usually do when I travel make my own bag of raw whole nut mixtures. I would also try organic herbal tea cleanse before flights and after your flights to cleanse your colon. I hope these suggestion are useful and wish you safe flights. esben andersen 
Why would you think its startling. Everybody I know who has tried whole foods diet has had problems with constipation . I now have known 4 people who went whole foods. 2 tablespoons whole flax in a cup of water in the morning, plus 2 cups warm water , will normally get some movement .Also half a cup sauerkraut twice a day has solved the problem for people even ones that have had a life long problem with constipation. EquaYona 
It is startling because whole PLANT foods(I assume that is what you meant) usually means a great increase in both fiber and fluids. Although I have rarely ever had constipation in my life, my vegan diet has increased my bowel movements to 2-3 times a day. I have never heard of anyone on a plant based diet having persistent problems with constipation. Until now. ;) Blair Rollin 
I agree. I can hardly believe it would be possible. Jack Hall 
Insufficient fat on my very low-fat whole foods plant based diet nearly killed my guts. Also, I did not adjust my fluid intake to accomodate for all of the additional fibre I began consuming, which added to the problem. I was hurting so bad that I couldn’t sit without severe pain and I looked as if I had swallowed a beach-ball for days at a time regardless of how many veggies or fibrous foods I ate. 
Anyway, I hope it was the fat. My only overt fat was coming from oats and two tablespoons of flax a day. I was coming in at under 30grams fat per day. Now I have added about 1 ounce of nuts which seems to have helped. EquaYona 
Glad to hear you are feeling better. I have always consumed a lot of fluids and peanut butter and whole peanuts have been important in my diet since I was in my teens. Lucky preferences, I reckon. Darla Eaves 
Ah yes. Sauerkraut! lisa c 
Magnesium is magic. And calming. I’ve taken it in tablet and powder form, adjusting dose as needed. Rex Ashbaugh 
Ellie, I would suggest getting more ‘resistant starch’ foods in your diet. To feed the microbiome. The bulk of the stool is mostly composed of bacteria. That bacteria needs to be fed. 
http://nutritionfacts.org/video/gut-dysbiosis-starving-microbial-self/ v 
Are you being consistent in your efforts to follow Dr. Gregor’s Daily Dozen? I ask because he recommends 1.5 cups of beans per day, plus a serving of cruciferous vegetables (kale or broccoli or cabbage), plus a cup of cooked greens (more kale, or collards, romaine, etc.). Add to that some fruit and a serving of berries, plus more vegetables. When I manage to eat that way (I try to do it every day, but fall short of complying 100% most days) it makes a big difference. It’s a ton of fresh food, water, and fiber. Ellie Lee-wasson 
I try, but, as I previously mentioned, I work in aviation so hitting all of the checkmarks in the app is difficult, but I consistently hit 20 of the 24 v 
I find whole wheat pasta + cannellini beans + greens (broccoli raab or swiss chard or kale) in a garlicky vegetable broth to work very well in this department. 
I think it’s because it has the fiber + liquid all together. Maybe give it a try? It’s delicious. Hope this helps! Ellie Lee-wasson 
How do you prepare the broth? bradf 
I work in aviation as well, I travel with a thermal bag and several days of vegan food, rice/quinoa based grain salads travel well, you can call hotels ahead and check for a fridge, use happy cow to find vegan food on layovers. I use freezer packs, but this bag lets you throw in loose ice and doesn’t leak Ellie Lee-wasson 
Do you work for a mainline or a regional? I also bring my food, but, don’t often have time to eat until the evening. During the day, I try to eat fruit, beans and greens etc. At night. bradf 
mainline, typical flight is 2 hours or more so there is time to eat enroute. If you’re at a regional I could see that eating during your workday could be a problem. Ellie Lee-wasson 
Yeah, I work for a regional Gatherer 
This comment has little scientific evidence behind it. It is just a suggestion. 
With your current diet you probably eat at least the minimum recommended amount of fiber, but even that is about a third of our ancestral fiber consumption. Thus additional fiber in your diet isn’t going to hurt you. Further, if you drink some fiber before eating food you should feel full earlier during your meal. 
Accordingly, I suggest that before lunch and dinner you disperse a tablespoon (15 ml) of psyllium husks into 10 oz (300 ml) of water and drink it. The fiber should help with the constipation by providing bulk, and may slightly reduce the amount of food you eat which will, over time, help with weight loss. 
For weight loss without counting calories or feeling hungry, try the Dr McDougall maximum weight loss advice. https://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2005nl/050100pupushing.htm Panchito 
Not everybody has the same body. There could be non dietary factors to constipation like genetic (asymmetry and development) or nervous (enteric nervous system) Jenny Barnes 
Hi Ellie, have you looked at your stress levels? A few years back I was only ‘going’ once a week, despite plenty of veggies, water and exercise. My doctor recommended looking at the stress in my life, and making sure I took time out to relax made a huge difference. Jenny Barnes 
Also, if you’re struggling to lose weight that can be due to stress – high cortisol levels make your body hold onto fat. I believe the idea is that historically if we were in a high stress situation this would make sense because this would often be accompanied by famine. EquaYona 
I like the little Dr Greger, it was a cute way to interject your joke. Foroogh – NF Moderator

20521,20521,Shadow of Plea Deal for David Petraeus Loomed Over Hillary Clinton Email Case - The New York Times,Eric Lichtblau,"WASHINGTON  —   As F. B. I. lawyers weighed whether to recommend criminal charges over Hillary Clinton’s private email server, one recent controversy loomed large over their decision: the plea deal reached last year by David H. Petraeus, the retired   general and C. I. A. director, for giving highly classified information to a woman with whom he had an affair. James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, said Tuesday that in assessing the Clinton case and looking at past cases on the handling of classified information, “we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts. ” He did not mention Mr. Petraeus by name, but Mr. Comey and other F. B. I. officials were known to be deeply upset by the Justice Department’s willingness to let Mr. Petraeus plead to a misdemeanor charge in the case. That decision complicated the Clinton investigation enormously for the F. B. I. because the case against Mrs. Clinton appeared much weaker to them than the case against Mr. Petraeus. In the Petraeus case, the retired general acknowledged in a taped interview that he knew that some of the “black book” journals he gave to his mistress, Paula Broadwell, for a book she was writing were “highly classified,” according to court documents. He then lied to F. B. I. investigators, denying that he gave her any classified information. In contrast, Mr. Comey said in the Clinton case that “we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information. ” Mr. Comey and the F. B. I. had pushed for felony charges against Mr. Petraeus for mishandling classified information and then lying about it. But Eric H. Holder Jr. then the attorney general, overruled Mr. Comey and reduced the charge to a misdemeanor, sparing Mr. Petraeus any jail time. While one case does not serve as binding precedent for the next, prosecutors and F. B. I. agents said that Mr. Petraeus’s sentence made it harder to argue that Ms. Clinton should face charges, barring some new revelation.",0

Ahead of today’s FOMC announcement and with gold hitting $1,300, look at who is bullish. 
Here is what Peter Boockvar wrote today as the world awaits the next round of monetary madness: Robert Heller, the former Federal Reserve Governor, had it right yesterday on the Santelli Exchange. He said what’s the point of scheduling an FOMC meeting one week before the election if the election gives them reason to do nothing… IMPORTANT: To hear which legend just spoke with KWN about $8,000 gold and the coming mania in the gold, silver, and mining shares markets CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. 
It was more than two months ago when Janet Yellen in Jackson Hole said that “the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months.” This was repeated by her in the month after and three members wanted to hike in September. As the data hasn’t changed much of late, politics is the only reason why they aren’t hiking today. This comment of mine is putting aside the intellectual debate over the data and whether they should or shouldn’t hike based on it. I’m just focusing on what we’ve heard from voting members over the past two months since Jackson Hole. Odds of a December hike are at about 65%. Either way, the market has already tightened for the Fed. 3 month LIBOR hasn’t fallen one iota since the mutual fund rule deadline passed 2 ½ weeks ago. Worries over interest rates, both market based and with the Fed, the election and the drop in markets saw a sharp change in stock market sentiment this week . Investors Intelligence said Bulls fell to 41.7 from 47.1 last week. Rather than getting bearish, most went into the Correction camp which rose to a 4 month high at 34 vs 29.8 last week. Bears did rise to a 6 week high but only to 24.3 from 23.1. The 2nd longest bull market in history where any pain has been anesthetized by central banks has flattened the bears and the most bearish many get is ‘we’ll have a normal correction and let’s buy it.’ With Gold Hitting $1,300, I Remain Bullish US dollar weakness for a 2nd day has gold approaching $1300 again. We can likely chalk up the weakness to the shift in the election polls. I repeat my belief that the US dollar is not on the cusp of breaking out above the 100 level even if the Fed hikes rates next month (and even if Hillary wins). One hike a year is not reason enough for me to get all bulled up on the dollar. As for gold and in addition to its contra move to the dollar, it is trading opposite to the world’s faith in central banks and that faith is clearly waning. I thus remain bullish.

To be white and from money is to live a life of largely unrecognized privilege, bequeathed as it is from one’s first wet, howling breath. In the affluent socio-economically partitioned town of Saratoga Springs, NY where I’m from there was actually a railroad track serving as the demarcation line between affluent whites residing on one side and the other side of which nothing was known because you just didn’t go there, ever. It was literally the “wrong side of the tracks”. 
Raised in that remarkable state of incurious joy and suffering within narrow undiluted lines of stratified suburban sameness, I could not know or question the things kept from sight. Thus racial determinism was assumed passively, an acquired naivete fueled with the aspirational angst of middle class parenting that served as an omniscient narcotic fog, like carbon monoxide – not enough to be lethal, but just enough to render the critical faculties permanently dull until finally the things kept from sight could no longer be seen even upon close observation. 
To be white is to watch but not see while being seen but never watched. It is to know that for whatever law enforcement is or is not, they are something that will never have anything to do with me. It is to know that on those rare occasions I am pulled over, it really is about a busted tail light. 
To be white is to know that when a retail clerk approaches me, it’s about customer service and not the smothering sea of smiles…",1
20524,20524,FREE Summit from Health Experts Teaches About Healthy Fats to Reverse Disease and Lose Weight,Admin,"by Brian Shilhavy Editor, Health Impact News 
15 years ago, I was the first one to import a high quality saturated fat called “Virgin Coconut Oil” from the Philippines and market it in the U.S. market. Coconut oil is a traditional fat that has been consumed for thousand of years in tropical climates, where historically western diseases like heart disease, diabetes, obesity and others were not common, in spite of their high saturated fat diet. 
During World War II when the Japanese cut of the supply of the high saturated fat edible oils like coconut oil and palm oil with their occupation of the Philippines and other Southeastern nations, industry in the U.S. developed the “expeller-pressed” method of extracting oil from seeds that had not previously been a source of dietary oil, mainly the U.S. cash crops of soybeans and corn. These polyunsaturated oils were not shelf-stable edible oils, so the industrial process of “homogenization” was developed to make them more shelf stable, and behave more like shelf-stable saturated fats. 
Politics, not science, influenced government agencies like the USDA to promote these new polyunsaturated oils as more healthy than saturated fats. A new dietary dogma of “low-fat” was developed, and history now shows that America’s health greatly suffered as a result. Until even today, we have seen very high numbers of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease plaguing Americans. 
So it was with much opposition 15 years ago that I presented the real science behind coconut oil and saturated fats, but many now are waking up to the terrible consequences of following the government-sponsored low-fat diet dogma for so many years. 
One can truly turn their health around by simply making a dietary choice as to the types of fats one consumes, and increase the consumption of healthy fats, particularly when those fats in the diet replace harmful processed carbohydrates. The Science of Fats: Information that Could Change Your Life 
From November 7 – 14 Dr. Mark Hyman , Dr. Carrie Diulus, and over 30 of the world’s top experts on fats will participate in an online FREE summit dispeling the biggest MYTHS about fat, and revealing the latest research about how to eat, move and supplement your diet for improved health and longevity. Join these world-renowned experts, such as Aseem Malhotra, MD (one of Britain’s top cardiologists), Amy Myers, MD , Gary Taubes (famous science author that challenged mainstream media’s dogma on fats), Sayer Ji (Founder of GreenMedInfo.com), best-selling author Nina Teicholz , Peter Attia, MD , and dozens of others! 
There’s so much confusion and misinformation out there about FAT…both the fat on our bodies, and the fats we eat. You’ve been told that eating fat makes you fat — and increases your risk for heart disease and other chronic illnesses — but fat is NOT the enemy. The truth is: eating MORE FAT can help shut down cravings, accelerate weight loss and potentially prevent or reverse disease.

(Photo by AP) 
Foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Syria have started trilateral talks on a political solution to the Syria crisis besides a serious fight against the Takfiri terror groups operating in the Arab country. 
On Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and his Russian and Syrian counterparts, Sergei Lavrov and Walid Muallem, gathered in Moscow for a three-way meeting. 
Ahead of the meeting, Lavrov said the three nations are acting as a united front against terrorism, saying their talks are mainly focused on ways of seriously tackling terrorism, particularly in Syria. 
The three sides, Lavrov added, will exchange views on humanitarian operations as well as efforts to stop the flow of weapons and military equipment to the foreign-backed militants operating against the Damascus government. 
Prior to the three-way discussions, Zarif held a bilateral meeting with Lavrov to discuss regional issues and the further enhancement of bilateral Tehran-Moscow ties.

Upon his arrival at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow on Friday morning, Zarif said a political solution besides a serious fight against terrorism is the only way out of the crisis gripping Syria. 
“Unfortunately, some countries have always pursued war and a military solution in Syria. This is while the solution to this crisis is of a political nature and also [entails] battles against Takfiri groups,” said Zarif. 
He added, “We have always emphasized the need for the establishment of an all-out ceasefire, humanitarian operations and efforts to find a political solution to the Syrian issue.” 
Following the trilateral talks, the three ministers attended a joint press conference. 
During the presser, Muallem slammed the US-led coalition purportedly fighting Daesh, saying the alliance has never been fighting terrorism despite its claims. 
He said the Washington-led campaign was in fact encouraging Daesh terrorists to move from Iraq’s Mosul to Syria’s Raqqah. 
Mosul and Raqqah have served as the main Daesh bases in the Middle East over the past years. Iraqi and Syrian armed forces are engaged in large-scale military offensive to drive the terror group from the two cities. 
The Syrian foreign minister further said his country would continue cooperation with Iran and Russia in efforts to eradicate terrorism. 
Muallem described the atmosphere of the talks in Russia as “positive” and “very comfortable.” 
“We in Syria have become convinced of the sincerity of the Russian and Iranian efforts in helping us rout terrorism,” he added.

(Photo by Reuters) 
Zarif, in turn, described the talks in Moscow as “very productive,” saying Iran and Russia have developed “very close” relations in different areas. 
Commenting on the situation in Syria, the top Iranian diplomat said Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be protected, adding that it is up to the Syrian nation to determine its own destiny and that the voice of the Syrians must be recognized. 
He further highlighted the need for a political settlement of the crisis, adding that Tehran backs the resumption of peace talks between the Syrian government and opposition. 
The Iranian minister called for a ceasefire in Syria, joint battles against terror groups as well as efforts to facilitate aid delivery to Syrian civilians in besieged areas. 
He said the global community must unite in the battle against terrorism, which poses a threat not only to Syria, but the entire world. 
Zarif added that supporting terrorism would serve the interest of no one, warning that the terror groups would eventually “bite the hands that feed them.” 
For his part, the Russian foreign minister also touched on the Mosul battle in Iraq, saying that Iraqi city’s liberation from Daesh would have a significant impact on the balance of power in neighboring Syria. 
Lavrov said the political settlement in Syria should be achieved through dialogue according to the Security Council resolutions, welcoming Syria’s readiness to resume the stalled talks with the opposition. 
Referring to the situation in Aleppo, Lavrov said terrorists blocked the exit routes opened as part of a Syrian humanitarian pause and prevented the civilians from leaving the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo City. 
The senior Russian official also criticized the international organizations for failing to fulfill their duties towards the locals of eastern Aleppo. 
Lavrov emphasized that the fight against terrorism in Syria will continue, adding that “future common steps” in this regard during the Moscow talks. Loading ...",1
20527,20527,"How Apple Empowers, and Employs, the American Working Class - The New York Times",Vindu Goel,"AUSTIN, Tex.  —   During the presidential campaign,   Donald J. Trump complained that America had lost too many manufacturing jobs and promised to force big companies like Apple to bring that work home. “I’m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,” he said. For a host of reasons, Apple is unlikely to produce iPhones in the United States. But opening a smartphone factory in this country is not the only way to provide solid employment for   Americans who lack college degrees. Apple’s overall contribution to the American economy is significant. Beyond the 80, 000 people it directly employs in the United States, it says 69 supplier facilities in 33 states manufacture parts that go into its products. Hundreds of thousands of software developers also write apps for iPhones and iPads. Apple’s rapid growth here in central Texas, where it now employs about 6, 000 people, up from 2, 100 seven years ago, provides a window into the vast constellation of jobs at the world’s largest technology company and their economic impact. At Apple’s sparkling new complex in northwest Austin, workers who are spread throughout seven    buildings field about 8, 000 customer   calls a day, manage the company’s vast network of suppliers and figure out how to move around millions of iPhones a week to ensure they get into the hands of customers when they want them. Employees here help run Apple’s iTunes music and app stores, handle the billions of dollars going in and out of the company’s American operations and continuously update the Maps software that is integral to iPhones and iPads. At another Austin location, about 500 engineers work on the chips that will run the next round of Apple’s products. The Austin campus  —   the company’s largest outside its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.  —   offers plenty of perks, too. When employees are not working, they can lounge on chairs shaded from the Texas sun, dine at a   cafeteria that serves an abundance of food options, including barbecued ribs and   gelato, and visit a   medical clinic, which includes dentists, acupuncturists and a   pharmacy. Although contractors at the Austin technical support call center earn as little as $14. 50 an hour, equivalent to about $30, 000 a year, many of them become permanent staff members, which means better pay, after the typical   contract is up. Experienced call center employees earn around $45, 000 a year, plus generous benefits and small annual stock grants. Pay is even higher for more senior advisers and managers. Apple says that, excluding benefits and stock compensation, the average salary of its Austin employees, including management, is $77, 000 a year. Apple declined to discuss its future expansion plans in Austin and in the United States. “Apple has created over two million jobs in the United States since the introduction of the iPhone nine years ago, including explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 percent increase in our employee teams,” the company said in a statement. “We made the unique decision to keep and expand our contact centers for customers in the Americas in the United States, and Austin is home to many of those employees. We plan to continue to invest and grow across the U. S. ” Last week, a reporter and photographer visited the Austin campus and interviewed more than a dozen workers, from managers to a prep cook on the kitchen staff. Apple’s public relations staff monitored some of the conversations, but others were unsupervised. Genny Lopez, who went to college for two years and used to work as a bartender, joined Apple as a contractor handling tech support calls. She is now on staff, troubleshooting difficult customer problems. “You don’t need a crazy technical background to do this job,” Ms. Lopez said. “A lot of the training is getting really good at talking to people. ” Apple prides itself on providing   phone service in 26 languages  —   12 are spoken at the Texas call center alone  —   and the people who handle the calls are expected to follow up on any problem that cannot be quickly resolved. During the recent visit, Stephanie Dumareille, a senior adviser on iOS issues who is fluent in English and Spanish, patiently answered questions from a customer who was worried about saving her résumé online and did not know whether she was using a Windows or a Mac computer. Employees say that Apple encourages them to move within and across teams, and the company is instituting a formal program to allow workers to try a completely different role for six months to see it if suits them and the company. Brisa Carillo, who started out in the call center fresh out of college five years ago, now handles international payroll matters and is studying for her M. B. A. so she can move up the ranks of the finance department within Apple. The region’s economy has deep roots in technology and is home to a number of big tech employers, most notably Dell. Apple’s influence in the area extends beyond the people on its direct payroll. It has 350 suppliers in Texas alone. And about 3, 400 construction workers helped build the Austin campus. Apple ensured that they all got paid at least $12 an hour. It also provided workers’ compensation insurance and safety training, and it allowed the monitoring of conditions by an outside labor group, the Workers Defense Project, which has been trying to improve safety and pay in Texas construction. “There is a high road, and Apple followed that path,” said Bo Delp, director of the Better Builder program at the Workers Defense Project. “It sent a pretty strong message to others in Austin. ” A mile from its Austin campus, Apple is involved in manufacturing, through Flex, a global contract manufacturer. Flex assembles Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computers to meet the exact requirements of customers, who can choose among more than 4, 000 combinations of features and hardware. Flex added about 2, 000 jobs for the Apple project. Although Apple and Flex declined to discuss details of their arrangement, the assembly jobs start at $11 an hour and pay an average of about $30, 000 a year, according to testimony by Flex officials in 2014, when they sought government aid for the expansion. Apple could in theory build more products in the United States through contractors like Flex. But the company and industrial experts say that would be very difficult and could easily add $100 to the final cost of an iPhone. China has built a whole ecosystem of suppliers for nearly every electronic part imaginable. Vast pools of trained labor make it easy to quickly scale production up or down to meet demand. Larger products, or ones that require more customizing, such as PCs, make more sense to build close to the final customer. “It’s easy to ship a phone, and it’s harder to ship a computer,” said Andy Tsay, a professor at Santa Clara University who has studied global manufacturing patterns. “And it’s harder still for cars and refrigerators. ” Over time, the value of Apple’s business is shifting away from hardware like the iPhone and into software such as apps and services like Apple Music, Mr. Tsay said. And those jobs can be much better for workers. “There are fewer industrial accidents working in a call center,” he said. “There is probably more gender equity. And it’s probably better for customers, too. ” Alan Marquis, a former Army officer who spent a couple of years streamlining processes on a manufacturer’s assembly line before joining Apple, now manages part of the complex software that integrates Apple’s suppliers into the company’s production systems. “Here, there’s a lot more openness and creativity,” he said. “In manufacturing, it’s a lot more widgets dropping off the line. ” Mayor Steve Adler of Austin, a Democrat, does not sweat the details of the jobs companies create in his city. He is more concerned that the work pays enough  —   at least $20 an hour  —   to support the city’s middle class, which is being squeezed by rising home prices. Some of the new jobs, like those at the Austin chip factory owned by Samsung, Apple’s biggest rival in the smartphone business, will be in manufacturing. Others, like the ones Apple brings, will be in services. “The best kind of jobs are those that allow someone to continue to grow and climb the ladder,” Mr. Adler said. Asked about Apple’s lack of manufacturing in the United States, Ms. Lopez said: “The product that Apple builds here is us. ”",0
20528,20528,"Let Women Abort Babies for Being the Wrong Sex, Says Top Medical Ethicist",Nick Hallett,"Women should be able to abort their babies simply because they are the “wrong” sex, a leading ethicist at Britain’s doctors’ union has said. [Professor Wendy Savage, a member of the ethics committee of the British Medical Association, said women should be able to have an abortion at any stage of pregnancy for whatever reason, even when the child would be able to survive outside of the womb.  She also said that abortion pills should be available online without the need to see a doctor or nurse. There has been growing concern in Britain that an increasing number of women are seeking abortions simply because they do not want girls, leading to some hospitals refusing to tell parents the sex of their babies. However, Professor Savage told the Mail on Sunday: “Because of this sort of anxiety some places won’t tell the woman the sex of the foetus, which is outrageous. “It’s her body and her foetus, so she should have that information  …     If a woman does not want to have a foetus who is one sex or the other, forcing her [to go through with the pregnancy] is not going to be good for the eventual child, and it’s not going to be good for [the mother’s] mental health. ” She previously caused outrage after signing a letter claiming   abortion is not “gender discrimination” because that only applies to “living people”. She then doubled down on those views, claiming the unborn child is not really a person. “The foetus is a potential human life at that stage [in the womb] it is not an actual human life  …     I think you’ve got to concentrate on the [rights of the] woman. ”   campaigners have branded her comments “utterly abhorrent” with Conservative MP Mark Field saying: “To have someone like Wendy Savage with her extreme views at the heart of the BMA is a very worrying sign. The majority of people in this country, even those who support abortion, think   abortion is a step too far. ” “Effectively we have abortion on demand nowadays, and all the safeguards we are supposed to have are being ridden roughshod over,” he added.",0
20529,20529,Why American Surrogates Are in Demand for Chinese Families,Henry Wolff,"Why American Surrogates Are in Demand for Chinese Families Kalee Thompson, Hollywood Reporter, November 4, 2016 
The first time Dianna Barindelli carried a baby that wasn’t her own was in 2012. “We were done having kids, but I still wanted to be pregnant,” says the Modesto, Calif., stay-at-home mom, whose own daughters are 6 and 9. Barindelli signed up with the Center for Surrogate Parenting in Encino, one of the most exclusive surrogacy agencies in the world. In 2014, she matched with a Chinese couple. Unlike many agencies, CSP first shows parent applications to the surrogates, rather than the other way around. “It’s little things that you’ll connect with people over,” says Barindelli, who was attracted to pictures of the couple’s extended travels and their traditional wedding photos. 
The embryo transfer took place in late 2014. Barindelli emailed the mom weekly, sending updates and ultrasound pictures with WeChat, an app that offers instantaneous translation. The intended parents (IPs) planned to be there for the birth, but the baby boy arrived two weeks early, 24 hours before they arrived. Says Barindelli: “I texted and made sure [the mom] was OK with him staying in my room. I cleared everything with her. I didn’t want her to feel bad that she wasn’t there.” 
Barindelli, who used her surrogacy fees to set up a college fund for her girls, is pregnant again, this time with the baby, due Feb. 1, of a Taiwanese couple. She may not be done: Her first Chinese couple emailed her recently, soon after their son’s first birthday. They still have frozen embryos and hope that Barindelli, now 40, will carry their second child. 
Commercial surrogacy is banned in most parts of the world, as well as in many U.S. states. Until recently, infertile couples, singles and gay would-be dads had a handful of options to turn to when it came to finding a surrogate, among them India, Thailand, Nepal and Mexico, where surrogacy services have cost a quarter of the $100,000 to $200,000 bill typical in the U.S. But in the past few years, those countries have started enforcing laws banning international surrogacy. Meanwhile, China–the world’s most populous country, with a growing wealthy elite and where some doctors believe infertility is more common than in the U.S.–lifted its decades-long one-child policy. The result is a soaring Chinese demand for U.S. surrogacy services, one that is flourishing particularly in California, with its culturally friendly enclaves, excellent physicians and favorable state laws that regard IPs as a baby’s legal parents even before birth, if proper court documents are filed. {snip} 
{snip} Despite CSP’s Southern California location, 51 percent of its clients now are foreigners, up from 15 percent a decade ago. Rival agency Growing Generations (clients have included Sarah Jessica Parker and 30 Rock director Todd Holland) also sees half of its clients coming from overseas, as does Gifted Journeys, a boutique agency in Pasadena. At San Diego’s Expect Miracles Surrogacy, international clients account for 80 percent of IPs. And of foreigners participating in this permutation of California’s birth tourism, the number of Chinese IPs is growing the fastest, making up the most common single foreign nationality for many agencies right now. 
{snip} 
Most local agencies have a mix of Caucasian, Latina and African-American surrogates. “I can’t think of a time when we’ve had an Asian surrogate,” says Growing Generations’ Bergman. Multiple agency heads say Chinese IPs tend to strongly prefer a Caucasian surrogate. “People really have this fantasy because of a lot of the marketing that was done in China,” says Gifted Journey’s Wilson-Miller. “They have this picture of blond surrogates who look like movie stars carrying the baby with their traditional families.” {snip} 
The concept of cross-race surrogacy can confound friends, family and associates of surrogates and IPs alike. In August, comedian GloZell Green, who is African-American, and her husband, also African-American, had a baby girl via a surrogate. “Our surrogate is a blue-eyed blonde,” the YouTube star told potential IPs gathered in a Culver City hotel in early October. People in her life “kept asking if the baby was going to be white.” 
Surrogate selection aside, California has the added allure of numerous enclaves where families can be surrounded by Chinese speakers and businesses. “People from China can stay in Irvine, for example, and they have Chinese TV on their cable packages. Throughout California there are places they can go and shop and find stuff in Chinese. If they go to Kansas or Oklahoma? It’s total culture shock,” says Expect Miracles’ Anderson. {snip} 
Of course, any baby born via surrogate in the U.S. has birthright citizenship. “The Chinese couples really like that because a lot of them want to come back and forth,” says Molly O’Brien, a fertility lawyer with offices in Torrance who frequently travels to China to participate in information sessions for would-be parents, often sponsored by doctors offices or assisted-reproduction agencies. “Maybe they eventually want that child to be able to go to college here.” Unlike the U.S., China forbids dual citizenship, and most American-born Chinese babies remain U.S. citizens. “Most Chinese couples just keep that American passport. It’s only if you want to use the government services that you’ve got to be Chinese,” says CSP’s Synesiou.

20530,20530,WATCH How Fast MSNBC Cuts Black Woman’s Interview When She Says THIS About Trump,The Conservative Millennial,"0 comments 
Sometimes racial profiling doesn’t work in your favor. That’s what an MSNBC reporter found out when he tried to interview a group of three black citizens in line for early voting in South Carolina. 
The reporter deliberately tried to bait the black voters into saying something negative about Trump, and was shocked to find out that they were actually supporters of the Republican nominee. 
“We’ve heard a lot of criticism of Trump’s inner city policy, but what do you make of that criticism? I’m sure you’ve heard it…” questioned the reporter. 
“Well, I think that Trump’s reaching out to all citizens, including African-Americans. I think he’s trying to address a problem,” responded one of the women. 
“It shouldn’t be a problem if you address that there’s something’s wrong and that you’ve got a plan to want to help people. That what a president should do for us, he should reach out and try to help people and address problems that are going on in our country.” 
Not yet deterred, the reporter tried to bait them again, asking, “Some of the criticism has been because he’ll often say, ‘What do you have to lose?’ Being specifically African-American, what do you think about that criticism?” 
“My word to all black Americans, one thing I would like to say,” answered another woman. “Let’s not be deceived. Look at the record. Look at the promises that have been made over the past from the Democratic Party. We’re not voting for a party, we’re voting for a man who has been standing by…” 
“He loves America! That’s what I love about him – he loves America. We need somebody that loves America. And he also loves all people. All people! And there’s that deception out there that he has no black supporters. WRONG! He does!” 
Well, all that was just way too much Republican support for MSNBC to handle and the reporter immediately ended the interview.

20531,20531,"David Brooks: Whites are “voting their gene pool” after being “ruined” by globalization, immigration, and feminism",Dr. Patrick Slattery,"David Brooks: Whites are “voting their gene pool” after being “ruined” by globalization, immigration, and feminism November 7, 2016 at 1:09 am By Dr. Patrick Slattery 
On the PBS News Hour on Friday, David Brooks said white people are “voting their gene pool.” Wow. Just wow. This is the same David Brooks who wrote in his New York Times column about a Jewish woman who came up to him after a speech, and knowing that he was Jewish too told him that his speech was a description of how Jews had taken over America, which he acknowledged in the column was indeed the case.One of my Jewish professors once boasted that “Jews earn like Episcopalians but vote like Puerto Ricans.” In other words, they voted their gene pool. Of course, they eventually bought out the Republican party as well, which gave their gene pool’s vote a choice.
Blacks famously vote their gene pool. Hispanics are expected to vote their gene pool. But when whites and whites alone consider their ethnic interests in voting, it is something that Brooks and the rest of the Zio elite and their Goyish lackey find “deplorable.” 
Basically, less educated or high school-educated whites are going to Trump. It doesn’t matter what the guy does. And college-educated going to Clinton. 
Sometimes, you get the sense that the campaign barely matters. People are just going with their gene pool and whatever it is. And that is one of the more depressing aspects of this race for me. 
But what Brooks said about the reasons for whites (besides the college-indoctrinated whites) voting their gene pool was even more interesting. 
We had a lot of good things over the years that were really good for America. I think globalization has been really good for America. I think the influx of immigrants has been really good for America. Feminism has been really good for America.” 
But there are a lot of people who used to be up in society, because of those three good things, are now down, a lot of high school-educated white guys. And they have been displaced. 
When David Brooks was growing up, whites make up close to 90% of the American population. So it doesn’t really make sense to say that the displacement of the bulk of the American population is good for America. 
Of course, he did specify “high school-educated white guys.” Well, were blacks helped by globalization, immigration, and feminism? What did that do for their employment rates, crime rates, illegitimacy rates, etc.? 
And white women? Well, maybe all they ever wanted in the first place was to have blue hair, nose rings, tattoos, and raise cats instead of babies. I guess we never asked them. 
And college educated white guys? Well, they used to go to Harvard and Yale. Now, with affirmative action for blacks and Hispanics, competition from Asians, and massive Jewish nepotism, a white guy is lucky to get into a second-tier state school. 
Brooks conclusion was even more breath taking: 
And shame on us for not paying attention to that and helping them out. And, therefore, as a result, what happened was, they were alienated, they got super cynical, because they really were being shafted. And so they react in an angry way. 
Well, that’s not a shock, given the last 30 or 50 years of American history. And so, for us going forward, it’s to not reverse the dynamism of American society and the diversity. It’s to pay attention to the people who are being ruined by it, and so this doesn’t happen again. 
Here he admits that whites got shafted. That we are being ruined by diversity. But the weird thing is that line about “so this doesn’t happen again.” What? Is he concerned that Hispanics might be Jewed out of the America they inherit from whites? 
The rest of his appearance was just a poetic rant against Donald Trump. With any luck, on Tuesday Trump will be elected president, and we can make begin the process of making America America again.",1

A SMARTLY-DRESSED man at a posh dinner party may well be Tim Farron, fellow guests have realised. 
Suspicions began to grow that the man, who is in his mid-40s and of average height and weight, was the leader of a minority political party between the main and pudding courses. 
Julian Cook of Devizes said: “He’s a Tim, but that doesn’t mean anything by itself. There are lots of Tims. 
“But when I asked what he did for a living, he replied ‘Aside from the obvious?’ and told me actually it’s a very demanding position despite what happened last year, which left me no nearer. 
“He does know Nick Clegg. Still, I suppose so do lots of people.” 
Susan Traherne, who hosted the party, admitted she has known Tim since university but has never really been sure of his occupation. 
She said: “He was planning to go into politics but I never heard anything else about it so assumed he’d given up on the idea. But the orange tie, the general hopelessness, I should’ve figured it out. 
“I’ve a dreadful feeling I was slagging off the Lib Dems in the kitchen earlier in the evening. I hope he didn’t hear.” 
Tim Farron said: “Oh for God’s sake. This is like the ninth time I’ve told them.”

20533,20533,Nick Cannon: Planned Parenthood Founded To Exterminate Black Race,Jerome Hudson,"Singer and TV personality Nick Cannon doubled down on his criticism of Planned Parenthood, saying the abortion provider was designed to “exterminate” black people. [“When you talked about Margaret Sanger, all the people who follow eugenics. It was all about cleansing,” the America’s Got Talent host said of Planned Parenthood’s founder in a recent interview with DJ Vlad.  “Margaret Sanger said that she wanted to exterminate the negro race, and that she was going to use her organization as she founded to do so,” Cannon continued. “It was more about the sterilization and where it comes to actual ethnic cleansing  —   where they actually said we want to get rid of a class of people a group of people. “  percent of them are all in the hood. ” “They like to label ‘ ’ or ‘’ that’s what they used in public. In private, they were talking about the black community,” Cannon said.  The      says the issue of abortion is more personal than political. “I’m   because my mother did go to an abortion clinic to abort me,” he said. “I don’t feel like the government should have the right. I don’t feel like any organization that makes money should have the right to tell a woman what she can or cannot do with her body. ” Cannon says while Planned Parenthood  —   like the government  —   does some good things, it should be held accountable for “all the negative things. ” Last month, Cannon accused Planned Parenthood of committing “real genocide” on black Americans. “Hillary was sneaking and cheating,” Cannon said in an interview with “The Breakfast Club” radio show. “Think about all the stuff they did with Planned Parenthood and all that type of stuff.

20534,20534,Marvel Artist Fired for Hiding Anti-Semitic Messages in X-Men Comic - Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,"Comic book artist Ardian Syaf’s contract with Marvel has been terminated after he hid   and   references within the first issue of   Gold. [Breitbart previously reported on Syaf and the Koran verses referenced within the first issue of Marvel’s new series   Gold. Syaf, an Indonesian artist, inserted political and religious references relating to the recent Indonesian election into the comic. The issue reportedly featured a reference to a verse in the Koran which urges Muslims not to take Christians and Jews as allies.  The verse roughly translates, “O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are, in fact, allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you  —   then indeed, he is one of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people. ” The issue also contained a reference to a protest movement against the Christian governor of Jakarta over allegations of blasphemy against Islam. Marvel initially stated in response: “These implied references do not reflect the views of the writer, editors or anyone else at Marvel and are in direct opposition of the inclusiveness of Marvel Comics and what the   have stood for since their creation. This artwork will be removed from subsequent printings, digital versions, and trade paperbacks and disciplinary action is being taken. ” That disciplinary action has now been confirmed as Syaf being fired from the comic series by Marvel. In a statement to CBR Marvel stated that the artist would no longer be working on the series and announced the replacement artists for later issues: Marvel has terminated Ardian Syaf’s contract effective immediately. ‘  Gold’ #2 and #3 featuring his work have already been sent to the printer and will continue to ship  . Issues #4, #5, and #6 will be drawn by R. B. Silva and issues #7, #8, and #9 will be drawn by Ken Lashley. A permanent replacement artist will be assigned to ‘  Gold’ in the coming weeks. In response to this, Syaf took to his Facebook page where he wrote a lengthy post: My career is over now. It’s the consequence what I did, and I take it. Please no more mockery, debat, no more hate. I hope all in peace. In this last chance, I want to tell you the true meaning of the numbers, 212 and QS 5:51. It is number of JUSTICE. It is number of LOVE. My love to Holy Qur’an  …    my love to the last prophet, the Messenger  …    my love to ALLAH, The One God. My apologize for all the noise. Good bye, May God bless you all. I love all of you.

20535,20535,President Trump Quietly Rolling Back Obama-Era Gun Controls,AWR Hawkins,"While rolling back onerous   environmental and business regulations, President Donald Trump has also been quietly dropping gun controls which were either put in place or at least prolonged by the Obama administration. [On February 28 Breitbart News reported that Trump signed the repeal of Obama’s Social Security gun ban  a ban which empowered the Social Security administration to strip away the Second Amendment rights of Social Security beneficiaries without due process. Days later, Trump’s Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke squashed Obama’s lead ammunition ban for federal lands and waters.  According to McClatchy, Trump’s administration has been quietly working to do away with other   firearm regulations as well. For example, “agencies narrowed the definition of ‘fugitive’” which, in turn, limits the number of people barred from gun possession because they are included in a fugitive database. Additionally, Trump “officials have also signaled that they may no longer defend the Army Corps of Engineers’ ban on carrying loaded firearms and ammunition on federal lands. ”",0
20536,20536,Crooked Hillary Risks Having ‘Blue Dress Moment’ By Aggressively Attacking FBI And James Comey,Geoffrey Grider,"  Crooked Hillary Risks Having ‘Blue Dress Moment’ By Aggressively Attacking FBI And James Comey Since Crooked Hillary has no idea what the FBI actually found, her gambit is every bit as bold, and reckless, as was her husband's decades earlier. She has now painted herself into the proverbial corner, and any evidence that the FBI produces will be amplified in light of her vigorous denials.   30, 2016 Interestingly, in 2016 at the height of the race for president, Hillary decides to adopt Bill’s bold denial strategy 
Way back when in 1998 , as the Bill Clinton sex scandal with intern Monica Lewinsky was coming to light, Slick Willy decided on a very risky strategy. Knowing full well that he was 100% guilty as charged, he decided to look right into the unblinking eye of the camera and issue a full-throated denial of any involvement of any kind. Watch and see it for yourself: Bill Clinton denies having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky: 
Now what Bill Clinton did not know was that Monica had saved a semen-stained blue dress with Bill Clinton’s semen on it, which she promptly presented as evidence to prove that she was not lying. By this time she was being trashed by Clinton operatives desperate to save Bill’s presidency, chief of whom was Crooked Hillary who had lots of nasty things to say about her husband’s victims. That led to this moment as seen here: Bill Clinton admits to having an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky: Interestingly, in 2016 at the height of the race for president, Hillary decides to adopt Bill’s bold denial strategy 
Hillary Clinton’s campaign hopes, as reported by Bloomberg today , its unusually swift response to revelations about a fresh FBI investigation into messages in connection with a past probe of her private e-mail server will blunt the political damage amid concern about close Senate races as well as the presidential election. 
With nine days to go until the election , Clinton and her aides went on the attack, intensifying criticism of James Comey as word emerged that the FBI director defied U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch by informing lawmakers of newly discovered e-mails that may relate to its investigation of the Democratic presidential nominee. Hillary Clinton addresses FBI email investigation: 
Clinton’s aggressive strategy contrasts with her bunker mentality in previous episodes of the controversy over her e-mail practices at the State Department. Her campaign is taking a calculated risk in publicly criticizing Comey and pressing him to quickly release more detail. Should new information contradict past statements or call into question the judgment of Clinton or any of her advisers who migrated from the Obama administration to her campaign, it could be damaging. 
Her rival Donald Trump told an audience in Phoenix the “only reason” Comey must have felt the need to tell lawmakers of the newly discovered e-mails is that “very, very serious things must be happening and must have been found. Very, very serious. Very, very serious.” 
Since Crooked Hillary has no idea what the FBI actually found, her gambit is every bit as bold, and reckless, as was her husband’s decades earlier. She has now painted herself into the proverbial corner, and any evidence that the FBI produces will be amplified in light of her vigorous denials. The WikiLeaks emails showed us that even John Podesta said she “lacks judgment” and discernment , and this is certain proof of that. 
But such is life when you’re a Clinton. Look right into the camera and commence lying. This is how they roll.

20537,20537,The Met Opera Is Struggling. How Can It Fill Those Empty Seats? - The New York Times,"Zachary Woolfe, Anthony Tommasini, Michael Cooper, Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim and David Allen","While there was plenty to celebrate artistically this season at the Metropolitan Opera  —   with several acclaimed new productions and memorable star turns  —   the company’s worrying   slump continued. The Met was on track to take in only 66 percent of its potential   revenue through the end of the season on Saturday, company officials said, down slightly from the previous season. (Since some seats are discounted, attendance is projected to be 72 percent.) Some weakness stemmed from factors beyond the Met’s control: Jonas Kaufmann, one of the last bankable stars in opera, withdrew from all his appearances this season, citing illness, and other opera companies are facing struggles of their own. But it is becoming a pattern. It is a daunting house to fill. With 3, 800 seats and 200   places, the Met is far bigger than most European houses, and it gave 225 opera performances this season, more than almost all of its peers. It sold an average of 2, 869 seats per performance  —   more than enough to fill the 2, 256 seats of the Royal Opera House in London or the Vienna State Opera, which can hold 2, 284. What to do? Channeling their inner impresarios, critics and reporters for The New York Times engaged in a little operatic spitballing, throwing out ideas  —   including some that the Met is experimenting with and others it might find off the wall  —   that could help fill the house again. MICHAEL COOPER Court the young, even more. Give operagoers in their teens and twenties not just the best seats at cheap prices but also steep discounts at the intermission bar. Create a club that offers exclusive access to rehearsals, meetings with directors and singers, and trips to performances elsewhere. Give them perks you don’t give your biggest donors. CORINNA da   Granted, this Met season has been unusually narrow: In   71 percent of performances have been of operas by Puccini, Verdi, Donizetti or Rossini. Heavier doses of Gounod, Massenet, Wagner and Strauss make   appear somewhat better balanced, but not enough. While unusual repertory can be a tough sell,   offerings are essential to a sustainable future. The Met should start by edging more often into Eastern Europe: Janacek should appear every year, and Mussorgsky, Prokofiev and Shostakovich deserve more than occasional outings. Then there’s the matter of time. The cavernous theater is a hindrance, admittedly, but Gluck and Handel ought to be mainstays, not rarities. And occasional forays into John Adams, alongside some Muhly and Adès commissions, aren’t nearly enough contemporary work. DAVID ALLEN A few years ago, the president of an opera club at Columbia Law School asked if I would join members for one of their regular lunchtime meetings. When I showed up, to my amazement, there were some 150 students in attendance and an enormous stack of pizzas. The Met should actively assist and encourage clubs for opera lovers with shared interests. The Met could arrange discounted tickets for designated performances and even host receptions for the clubs with special guests, like singers from the young artists program who might perform a couple of arias. ANTHONY TOMMASINI One seemingly simple way to draw bigger crowds: perform when it’s convenient for audiences. While other major opera houses, ballet companies and Broadway shows find that Sunday performances are among their most popular, the Met retains a longstanding    schedule that dates back to the days of strict blue laws. Many operagoers find weeknight performances difficult, especially for operas that last three hours or longer. An 8 p. m. start can be too late for older patrons and suburbanites who face long commutes after the final curtain. But earlier starts are tough for the many people who typically work much later than 5 p. m.  —   especially if they want to be able to eat dinner. Sunday matinees would be simpler for people in both groups and could appeal to operagoers from further afield. Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, has suggested adding some Sunday performances, but he will need to win the agreement of the Met’s unions, whose workers often have punishing schedules and who agreed to concessions in their last contracts. And going dark on a weekday would cut into the Met’s   rehearsal schedules. MICHAEL COOPER Every orchestra, it seems, has an artist in residence: In fact, the New York Philharmonic’s this season has been the   Eric Owens. Why not the Met? Planning is tough, of course, but with enough lead time, why couldn’t a singer participate in three (or four, or five) productions over a season, as well as concerts, recitals, lectures? The more audiences know (and love) a performer, the more eager they’ll be to buy tickets to see her. ZACHARY WOOLFE There’s much to be said for the stagione system in use in many European opera houses, in which only one production runs at a time. This makes it easier to instill a sense of urgency in the public: Your chance to see a show is now or never. As a magnet for cultural tourists, some of whom travel to New York to see multiple operas over a few days, the Met is understandably reluctant to do this, and the house is set up to run several productions at once. But it would still make sense to link thematically related works into   that encourage   like a “Lulu”  “Lucia” showdown of madwomen. CORINNA da   One “festival” is already offered by the Met, although it’s a summer of HD screenings on Lincoln Center Plaza. And, admittedly, festivals can be used as tools for both progress and reaction: The New York Philharmonic has its   biennial, but also its Dvorak and Rachmaninoff celebrations. Even so, a festival during the main season  —   done properly  —   would let the Met draw attention to new productions while trotting out old ones, help it build excitement for unusual repertoire and give it an opportunity for collaboration with other,   institutions. Imagine a series looking at the Orpheus myth over time, from Monteverdi to Birtwistle. Or treatments of Shakespeare, balancing Verdi with Barber, Reimann and Adès. Think what could be done for the forgotten Romantics, like Korngold and Schreker. One could even contemplate a pageant of American operas. DAVID ALLEN The holiday presentations of   operas  —   shorter, and in English  —   should be expanded across the season. Consider marketing the occasional matinee of a   opera to families, too, with     rules and affordable snacks at intermission. While you’re at it, take a hint from the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, which has players hang out at the front of the stage during intermission to take questions from audience members. Send choristers in costume out to the lobbies to pose for selfies. CORINNA da   New Yorkers like to dress up: Get in on the game. The Met should mark the dates of Fashion Week and throw open its doors with gala performances that enforce a strict dress code. Invite a runway star to dress the entire cast of one production, with apologies to the regular costume designer, then auction off the clothes. Don’t let the other Met and its Costume Institute steal all the paparazzi attention. CORINNA da   Why is it that audiences linger after performances at, say, the Park Avenue Armory, while they rush out of the Met? It’s because there’s no comfortable, exciting space at the opera house to sit down, chat, have unexpected  . My idea? Throw out the overpriced, mediocre Grand Tier Restaurant and replace it with something like the Smith, across Broadway: Moderately priced, a little rambunctious and open (including after the opera) for food (that includes both filet mignon and burgers) drinks (that includes both Champagne and beer) and good coffee. ZACHARY WOOLFE The company might select a couple of offerings each season and turn them into citywide cultural collaborations. It’s moving a bit in this direction next season for the company premiere of Kaija Saariaho’s “L’Amour de Loin. ” The Philharmonic will tie performances of Saariaho works at the Park Avenue Armory to the Met run. But couldn’t the two Mets (opera and museum) have worked on an exhibition on Christian troubadours from Aquitaine and religious art from Tripoli, the two locales this   story shifts between? How about asking early music ensembles to perform troubadour songs? How about Verdi’s “Otello,” which returned this spring in time for the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death? Imagine high school English teachers in the city, with the support of the Met, using this run as a chance to compare Shakespeare’s tragedy with Verdi’s opera and then taking students to the free dress rehearsal. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Even in the higher altitudes of the opera house, tickets are still quite expensive  —   especially when it comes to enticing new generations who may be iffy on the whole idea of giving opera a try. On many nights this season, the house seemed to sell out from the top down, with the least expensive tickets disappearing first. Prices currently range from $25 to $480, but the average is $158. 50. The company does have more discounted options than ever  —   there are $25 rush tickets, student ticket offers, “Fridays Under 40” discounts  —   but many of them place the onus on operagoers to figure them out, and some, like rush tickets, require a degree of   flexibility that is hard for people who need to, say, engage babysitters or plan ahead. And costly tickets make it harder for opera fanatics  —   people who not only want to see many different operas each year but also often want to see the same opera more than once, to revel in a favorite singer or compare alternate casts. What to do? Ticket revenues account for an increasingly small percentage of the cost of actually mounting operas. In a perfect world, perhaps a very   donor could be enticed to make a transformational gift that would allow the Met to cut its prices across the board. That would allow fanatics to go more often. More realistically, the Met could use the information available in most ticket purchases  —   perhaps the credit card numbers and email addresses people use when they buy tickets online  —   to offer   operagoers the chance to purchase, say,   tickets anywhere in the house. That could help groom future fanatics. MICHAEL COOPER Create a loyalty app that allows users to check in every time they visit. Add in a   quiz element that rewards close attention  —   to a detail of a character’s costume, a witty translation in the Met titles or a line in the program notes. Award bonus points for arcane trivia, frequent visits and thorny or new works. Make participation the entry requirement for lotteries that offer lavish prizes, like a parterre box for a night, a private dress fitting in the costume department or a chance to shadow a director for a day. CORINNA da   One option that would offend many   opera fans but might entice more newcomers: a little judicious cutting of operas, to make things flow a bit faster onstage and make it easier for audiences with too few hours in the day to find time for opera. Shakespeare’s plays are rarely performed uncut. But in opera, the trend in recent decades has been toward fewer cuts and treating scores as sacrosanct. To get people out at a reasonable hour, many opera companies, including the Met, now have fewer intermissions. Another option would be to cut the operas. The Met sometimes does this for its shortened,   holiday presentations aimed at families, which whittle down works like Mozart’s “The Magic Flute” and Rossini’s “The Barber of Seville” to two hours or less. While some gorgeous music gets left on the   floor, the shortened operas are often among the most popular offerings of the year  —   and draw quite a few adults who are unaccompanied by children. MICHAEL COOPER After years of illness and cancellations, James Levine, the Met’s longtime music director, has finally retired. Now, the company has a chance to nab a vibrant replacement who has technical chops, intriguing ideas about repertory, a taste for the new and a connection to the city and its cultural life. I’m thinking of the kind of leader you might see on a night off at National Sawdust or even Terminal 5. ZACHARY WOOLFE",0

20539,20539,Put Some Me-ing in Your Be-ing,Gillian,"2 Replies 
Jennifer Hoffman – Whenever I hear the word selfish, I can hear my mother’s voice saying ‘Don’t be selfish’ when I didn’t want to share something. As the oldest child and the oldest of my cousins, I was always expected to share my things with everyone, whether I wanted to or not. Selfishness was defined as not being willing to let everyone have whatever belonged to me anytime they wanted it, a belief I highly disagreed with. But there is a big difference between being selfish, taking everything so no one else can have any, and being self-ish, as in making your needs a priority, and this needs to be our focus now. Our joy is fully available when we ask ‘What makes me happy’ and ‘What works best for me’ and this happens when we are willing to be self-ish and putting ‘me-ing into our be-ing’. 
It is not possible for us to be comfortable within the collective if we are not self-ish because without selfishness, or having an awareness of our self and out needs, we can’t have any boundaries. And boundaries are how we manage the energy flows into and out of our realities. They ensure our energetic stability and set the foundation for the joy and other energies we want in our life. Without boundaries we risk scattering our energy and giving our power away. The key is to find the balance that maintains our individual joy-based energies as we share with and participate in the collective energy. 
Being self-ish is a delicate balance that is both in-clusive and ex-clusive, and the fulcrum or midpoint is the point of our optimal energetic frequency and vibration, which determines who approaches our boundaries and feels the need to be included and who excludes themselves because they can’t feel or do the connection. Anyone is welcome to be with us if they can pay the energetic price of admission, which could be to ‘love, honor, and respect me’. As long as we maintain a strong ‘me’ focus, we can be inclusively self-ish in a way that allows us to be confident in our insistence on the joy or other energies we want to be part of our reality. 
If we use another word for self-ish, like self-aware, self-focused, self-caring, and self-sourced, we don’t associate it with the negative meaning our mothers used, which also led to us believing that we needed to share our energy and power with everyone who looked like they needed it. Being self-ish simply means that in every choice and interaction, we are aware of our needs and we give them consideration first, without doubting our worthiness. 
Our spiritual path is both self-ish and unselfish, where we are inclusive in all things but exclusive in the energies we choose to participate in. This perspective also liberates us from the Martyred Healer paradigm, where we feel the need to heal everyone’s wounds, while denying ourselves access to the joy we try so hard to create for others. Putting ‘me-ing in your be-ing’ feeds your soul with the joy it craves, while empowering you to expand your reality to explore the fullness of your potential and possibilities. And when we are at the frequency of joy we become an example of empowered, joyful energy for everyone, as well as creating a portal for that energy to be experienced in the collective. 
At a time when the energies feel so chaotic and scattered, focusing on our joy, peace of mind and heart, love, and highest frequencies and outcomes allows us to ground those energies firmly into our realities. We can no longer adjust our reality to meet others’ needs, it feels too bad now. Nor can we wait for them to figure out what they want, they will have to do that for themselves. So much of what we are doing now is challenging us to be more self-ish, but that simply means to put ourselves in a state of joy so our light can shine brightly, and in the way that we and the world needs right now. 
And putting the ‘me-ing in our be-ing’ reminds us that when we give our needs the attention they deserve, we are allowing our heaven on earth to become possible and that is a good thing for everyone. Copyright (c) 2016 by Jennifer Hoffman. All rights reserved. Share this:",1
20540,20540,"Scaling Up a Drug Trade, Straight Through ISIS Turf - The New York Times",Rukmini Callimachi and Lorenzo Tondo,"PALERMO, Italy  —   The investigators for Italy’s antidrug unit were used to measuring the flow of hashish from Moroccan fields to European shores one speedboat or Jet Ski at a time. So when the phone rang with a tip that an enormous freighter loaded with hashish was plying international waters south of Sicily  —   bound for Libya, hundreds of miles to the east of the usual quick drug route to Spain  —   Francesco Amico, a senior investigator, immediately knew something odd was going on. Not just odd, but huge: When two Italian Navy warships eventually stopped the freighter, the Adam, off the Libyan coast on April 12, 2013, agents found a terrified Syrian crew and 15 metric tons of hashish  —   a stash many multiples larger than Italian officials had ever seen. “There was so much of the drug that we didn’t know where to put it,” said Mr. Amico, who waited in the Sicilian port of Trapani for the escorted ship to arrive. “We had to go out and rent a warehouse. ” The Italian officials had stumbled on a lucrative new trafficking route that stretched far to the east along the coast of Northern Africa  —   and always led to Libya, in an area fought over by competing armed groups that included the Islamic State. The Adam was the first of 20 ships that would be intercepted over the route over the following 32 months, officials say. Their collective cargo amounted to more than 280 tons of hashish valued at 2. 8 billion euros, or about $3. 2 billion  —   roughly half of what was seized in all of continental Europe last year, according to the European Union’s Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Then the tips dried up, and the busts stopped. The Italian investigation, which had expanded to include other European countries and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, has not seized any ships on the route in 2016, though officials say they believe the traffic continues. Instead, as they have sought to understand what happens to the enormous shipments, they are struggling with a mystery that has prompted intriguing questions but offered few answers. One thing they know is that the drugs were not ending up in Libya. The Moroccan drug producers consistently use individualized branding logos, like a scorpion or a dollar sign. That helped investigators pick up the drug shipments’ trail again after they left Libya, traveling along an overland route through Egypt and then on to Europe through the Balkans. But the investigators are still not sure what happened as the drugs passed through. From interrogations and surveillance, they know the route crossed territory that until a few weeks ago was claimed by the Islamic State  —   which has taxed shipments of drugs and other goods in Syria and Iraq. That, in particular, led the Italian drug investigators to start asking questions they never expected to confront: Could the Islamic State or some other group be profiting from the drug route by taxing it? Was the   chaos in Libya providing an opportunity by drug traffickers to pick a route the authorities wouldn’t suspect, or were the   groups more directly involved? The investigation continues. “Once it reaches Libya, we lose track of it,” said Lt. Col. Giuseppe Campobasso, who heads the antidrug unit in Sicily of the Guardia di Finanza, the Italian financial police force that led the search for the ships. For years, the Italian investigators had tracked small shipments of Moroccan hashish, around 100 kilograms at a time, coming to Spain in boats that crossed the Strait of Gibraltar  —   a narrow passage that ferries cross in under 35 minutes. In 2007, Spain began installing cameras up and down its southern coastline, but at least at first, the hashish traffic continued in the usual way. With Europe’s eyes trained on   traffic coming from the south, at first no one noticed the cargo ships that were taking a big dogleg to the east. Giacomo Catania, an inspector with the Guardia di Finanza who was in charge of storing the incoming drugs, explained another oddity: The enormous cargo ships they seized  —   some as long as a soccer field and designed to carry fleets of automobiles or cargo containers  —   were empty except for the drugs. “These are ships that have a capacity to carry thousands of tons, and the cargo in most cases was around 20 tons. Only a minuscule portion of it was used,” Mr. Catania said. That the smugglers were willing to operate so inefficiently  —   Mr. Catania compared it to using an   to transport a single pack of cigarettes  —   is testament to the value of the cargo. Considering that hashish sells for €10, 000, about $11, 200, per kilogram once it reaches Europe’s streets, the Adam’s cargo alone was worth at least €150 million. And shipments seized later were even bigger  —   including a load of hashish aboard the freighter Aberdeen, boarded in the summer of 2014, that was estimated to be worth €420 million  —   or about $472 million. After seizing the Adam, investigators in Italy interrogated its crew members, who insisted that they did not know that hashish was in the 591 plastic bags investigators had found on the ship’s deck. The ship’s captain testified that he believed he was transporting humanitarian aid, brought to the ship by the crew of a speedboat that approached them off the coast of Morocco and insisted that they take the bags, according to a transcript of his statement to investigators. To learn more, the investigators  —   who have decades of experience dealing with the Sicilian Mafia  —   decided to bug the cells where the six crew members were imprisoned. Over months of surveillance, Mr. Amico began to discern the outlines of the trafficking route, and the mystery of the militant stronghold in coastal Libya it passed through. Since the ouster of the Libyan leader Muammar   in 2011, stretches of Libya along the coastline in the eastern region of Cyrenaica had become a battleground for competing militant groups. By 2014, that included the Islamic State’s branch in Libya, which at various times had footholds in the cities of Benghazi, Derna and especially Surt, which has partly fallen to   forces. Italian officials believe that those cities were all destinations for some of the drug ships, although the navigation units of other seized vessels indicate that they were headed to the Libyan port of Tobruk, which is controlled by a rebel group fighting the Islamic State. Investigators say they believe that at least in some cases, the terrorist group would have been able to exact a tax in return for the drugs’ passage. That matches the Islamic State’s business practice in its stronghold in Syria and Iraq, where according to one study by IHS Country Risk, 7 percent of the group’s revenue last year was from the production, taxation and trafficking of drugs. But officials concede that they cannot be certain what role, if any, the Islamic State might play in the hashish shipments. “No one has eyes on the ground to say that they know for a fact,” said Masood Karimipour, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s regional representative for the Middle East and North Africa. “What we can offer, or make a reasonable inferences from, is that where the terrorists are holding terrain they are controlling everything that goes through it, including the trafficking of whatever  —   whether it’s weapons or drugs. ” Poring over the surveillance tapes of the jailed crew of the freighter Adam, Mr. Amico and the rest of his investigative team started to wonder whether the drugs were part of a bigger scheme, perhaps involving weapons. They learned that the Adam had begun its Mediterranean voyage in Cyprus, where it picked up four containers of “furniture,” destined for Benghazi. After dropping off the cargo, the vessel continued to Morocco, picking up 15 tons of hashish and returning to Libya. From other comments by the crew, Mr. Amico and his team came to believe that the “furniture” was a shipment of weapons, he said, an idea supported by two of the prosecutors involved in the case. “Libya is not a land where people consume hashish,” said Deputy Prosecutor Maurizio Agnello. “So that cargo of drugs is definitely a method of payment, a kind of coin. ” In recent months, however, the Italian investigation has stalled. Most of the tips were coming from French officials, who in recent months were scrambling to deal with a wave of terrorist attacks at home, and when the tips ended, so did the busts. No ships have been intercepted along the route in 2016, though investigators say they believe the path is still being used. They expressed unease about the lack of certainty regarding the players controlling the new route. “If this was controlled by the Mafia, we would know how to deal with it, because we know the Mafia well,” said Mr. Agnello, whose office is in a stately building in Palermo, a stronghold of the Sicilian Mafia, which for years controlled the hashish arriving from Morocco via Spain. When it comes to the possible involvement of terrorist groups, he said, “It frightens us because they don’t have limits. They do stuff that would be unthinkable for a Mafioso. ” ",0

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) said ” the way the Democratic Party has been run for decades has not worked.  Partial transcript as follows: TAPPER: So, let’s start with yesterday’s big vote at the DNC. You obviously strongly backed Congressman Ellison. He lost the race to former Labor Secretary Tom Perez. You issued a statement saying  —   quote  —   “At a time when Republicans control the White House, the U. S. House, U. S. Senate and   of all statehouses, it is imperative that Tom Perez understands that the     is not working. ” So, Senator, did the     win? SANDERS: Well, look, Keith ran a great campaign. He took on, in essence, Democratic insiders, and yet he came close to winning. That was a very impressive effort, when you realize that he was playing inside the establishment’s house. But, right now, I think, Tom Perez, who was a very, very good secretary of labor, has a real opportunity in his hands. And I hope he seizes it. And that is to understand that, in fact, the way the Democratic Party has been run for decades has not worked. We need a total transformation. We have got to open up the party to working people, to young people, and make it crystal clear that the Democratic Party is going to take on Wall Street, it’s going to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, it’s going to take on corporate America that is shutting down plants in this country and moving our jobs abroad. The idea that Trump thinks that the Republican Party is going to be the party of working people, when he has appointed people to his administration who want to cut Social Security, want to cut Medicare, want to cut Medicaid, or who want to provide a budget which will give huge tax breaks to billionaires like Trump, and then cut back on education and health care for the American people, if that’s a party that stands for working people, God help us all.

20543,20543,New to Airbnb? How to Make It Work for You - The New York Times,Lucas Peterson,"I have a confession: before writing this column, I had never used Airbnb. My first experience with this San     marketplace, which was founded in 2008 and dropped a proverbial bomb on the hotel industry, came when I visited Milwaukee in April. Before then, I had been hesitant to use the service: What if something went wrong? What if the place was grossly misrepresented? What if the owner tried to unfairly pin a broken dish or a rip in the sofa on me? The possibilities for something going wrong, it seemed, were endless. Eventually, though, I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. Or, at the very least, embrace it from time to time, depending on what I was looking for during my travels. That, I learned, is the key to using Airbnb: By knowing what you want in your lodgings, you can make the service work for you. [Update Sept. 8:] Airbnb has released a lengthy report and made changes to its platform in response to complaints about hosts discriminating against potential renters. Among other things, the company will be making hosts agree to a more detailed   policy, increasing the availability of Instant Book listings, and experimenting with “reducing the prominence” of user photos.   users who do not want to go through the typical vetting process of a standard Airbnb experience can use the Instant Book feature  —   hosts can still cancel, however, if they have “concerns about the reservation. ” Simply refusing to include a picture of yourself in your profile is another option. Regardless, if you feel you’ve been the victim of discrimination, don’t stay quiet: Write to Airbnb immediately. Here are a few tips for   users. DECIDE THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE YOU WANT Don’t feel like leaving your comfort zone? Want to get in and get out of a city quickly, with minimal hassle? A traditional hotel may be for you. The   process is predictable, there are creature comforts like housekeeping, and you can expect a certain minimal level of service. If you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, though, you could explore Airbnb. There, you would find opportunities for a more local experience than you could ever hope to have by staying in a traditional hotel. In Moscow, I stayed in the gorgeous artist’s studio of a local sculptor and got to know him and his wife. He shared his likenesses of Lenin and Yuri Gagarin, and she spent an afternoon showing me around the city. It was a unique experience I’ll never forget. BE REALISTIC One aspect that draws travelers to Airbnb is that it is frequently cheaper than hotels. Therefore, it’s important to temper your expectations. The bed may not be perfect, the faucet may leak, and the   may be spotty. Oh, and the “breakfast” part of “  ”? Best to take that with a grain of salt it hasn’t existed in any of the Airbnbs that I’ve booked. The greater informality can have its advantages, too. It lends itself to more flexibility as far as what time you can check in, for example, as well as what to do when you check out. In at least two places I’ve booked, “Just leave the keys under the mat” was the only instruction I received. KNOW WHAT YOU’RE GETTING You don’t want to show up at your booking with your significant other and awkwardly encounter another person  —   or worse, another couple  —   staying in the same place. The headings in the Airbnb listings search are: “Entire  ”: You’re booking an entire apartment or house and should not expect to share the space “Private room”: You are booking a private room within someone else’s home (bathroom privileges may vary) and “Shared room”: You’re in a bunk   situation (this is generally the cheapest rental). Pay attention to your search parameters so that there are no rude surprises. Chances are, if you’re getting an insanely good deal on that beachfront villa, you’re probably not going to be there alone. MESSAGE YOUR HOST BEFOREHAND There’s a natural vetting process with Airbnb. You have to message your hosts when you request to stay at their home, and they vet your message, and you, before they approve the stay. This allows the hosts to pick and choose their guests (and unfortunately has also led to cases of racial discrimination). There is also an Instant Book option, denoted by a small lightning bolt, that allows you to make a booking without sending a message or request. Generally, though, the more you communicate ahead of time with your host, the better. You can exchange information, coordinate schedules and figure out the best time to hand off keys. A quick    to get to know the person whose home you’re renting (and vice versa) makes for a more comfortable and pleasant experience. REALIZE THAT FILTERS ARE YOUR FRIEND After the initial landing page, when you’ve entered the basic parameters of your stay, you’ll see a map with your lodging options. On the left side, above the first listing, is a button labeled “Filters. ” Click on it, and you can whittle down your options by the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as the neighborhood. Scroll down to “Amenities. ” Initially you’ll see a few choices. But on the right side, you’ll see a small black arrow. Click on it to reveal many more options. Do you absolutely have to bring your dog along? Check off the “Pets Allowed” option. You can be very granular with your parameters if you want the host to provide shampoo, or if you require a lock on the bedroom door, you can search for that, too. KNOW THE CANCELLATION POLICY Before you book, know your host’s cancellation policy. Cancellation policies can vary from “Flexible,” meaning you’re allowed a refund provided you cancel within 24 hours of arrival, to “Strict,” which will afford you only a 50 percent refund  —   provided you canceled at least a week ahead of time. Either way, say goodbye to Airbnb’s nonrefundable fee, the exact calculus of which is maddeningly unspecific  —   it is “typically  % but can be higher or lower,” according to the website. WHEN IN DOUBT, TAKE PICTURES There are far more horror stories of guests damaging the homes of Airbnb hosts than of nightmare hosts, but it’s always good to be safe. When you arrive, do a quick inspection for any damage to the walls or furniture, and snap a few quick pictures  —   if you have a smartphone, a couple of panorama shots would do nicely. If you do notice something problematic, mention it right away to your host. Do this by communicating through the Airbnb website  —   not by sending personal emails back and forth. When you leave, take a couple of quick shots, as well. In the unlikely event of a dispute,   photos would help you prove you left your rental in good condition. LEAVE FEEDBACK The Airbnb ecosystem lives and dies by honest feedback. Reading reviews is the best way to learn about the quality of a rental and the best way to weed out the bad eggs who misrepresent their properties, or worse. So it behooves you, after your stay, to leave honest feedback and to rate various aspects of the property on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. But don’t think this goes only one way  —   hosts can also leave reviews of their guests. STILL UNSURE? RENT FROM A ‘SUPERHOST’ If you are wary about staying in a stranger’s home, you have the option of renting from a Superhost  —   someone who has consistently received positive reviews, denoted with a small gold medal by the profile. Eighty percent of Superhosts’ reviews have been awarded five stars, and Superhosts are held to high standards of responsiveness and following through with their bookings (i. e. not canceling at the last minute). Using Airbnb for the first time can be both an exciting and slightly anxious experience  —   I felt that way myself. If you have reservations but want to test the waters, a Superhost’s home may be a good first stay.",0

An NYU professor who launched a twitter war against the growing trend of universities coddling students with ""safe spaces"" and ""trigger warnings"" has been pushed out of his own classroom for his "" incivility ."" According to a report from the New York Post , Liberal Studies professor Michael Rectenwald was forced to go on paid leave for the rest of the semester after his undercover twitter account, ""Deplorable NYU Prof"", was linked back to him. 
Liberal studies prof Michael Rectenwald, 57, said he was forced Wednesday to go on paid leave for the rest of the semester . 

“They are actually pushing me out the door for having a different perspective,” the academic told The Post. 

Rectenwald launched an undercover Twitter account called Deplorable NYU Prof on Sept. 12 to argue against campus trends like “safe spaces,”“trigger warnings” and other aspects of academia’s growing PC culture. 

He chose to be anonymous, he explained in one of his first tweets, because he was afraid “the PC Gestapo would ruin me” if he put his name ­behind his conservative ideas on the famously liberal campus. 

“I remember once on my Facebook I posted a story about a kid who changed his pronoun to ‘His Majesty’ because I thought it was funny,” he told The Post. “Then I got viciously attacked by 400 people. This whole milieu is nauseating. I grew tired of it, so I made the account.” 
Below is a small sample of Rectenwald's tweets: The identity politics left: they need a safe space that is at once a hall of mirrors and a rubber room.

It wasn't long before Rectenwald's tweet storm drew the attention of NYU's student newspaper, the Washington Square Times, which reached out to him over twitter for an interview. Unfortunately, that interview, which was published last week , proved to be his undoing. Within 2 days of his identity being revealed publicly, NYU's "" Liberal Studies Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group "" had published a letter in the same newspaper finding Rectenwald ""guilty of illogic and incivility."" Later in that same day Rectenwald was forced to go on paid leave by administrators who claimed that ""a couple people had expressed concern about his mental health."" 
But Rectenwald says he began getting “dirty looks” in his department and on Wednesday figured out why: A 12-person committee calling itself the Liberal Studies Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Working Group , including two deans, published a letter to the editor in the same paper. 

“As long as he airs his views with so little appeal to evidence and civility, we must find him guilty of illogic and incivility in a community that predicates its work in great part on rational thought and the civil exchange of ideas,” they wrote. 

“We seek to create a dynamic community that values full participation. Such efforts are not the ‘destruction of academic integrity’ Professor Rectenwald suggests, but rather what make possible our program’s approach to global studies,” they argued. 

Rectenwald likened the attack to “a Salem witch trial. They took my views personally. I never even mentioned them and I never even said NYU liberal studies program. I was talking about academia at large.” 

The same day that letter was published, Rectenwald was summoned to a meeting with his department dean and an HR representative, he says. 

“They claimed they were worried about me and a couple people had expressed concern about my mental health,” Rectenwald told The Post. 

The leave has “absolutely zero to do with his Twitter account or his opinions on issues of the day,” said NYU spokesman Matt Nagel, refusing to elaborate on the reason. 

“I’m afraid my academic career is over,” he said. “Academic freedom: It’s great, as long as you don’t use it.” 
Is it any wonder that the liberal elite continues to run amok at our establishments of higher learning... anyone who dares express a non-conforming opinion is promptly found ""guilty of illogic and incivility"" and declared mentally incompetent. Share This Article...",1
20545,20545,21 Things We’ve Learned About Hillary,Daisy Luther,"October 28, 2016 
Let’s talk about Wikileaks. 
First of all, the organization was founded by Julian Assange back in 2006. Their website explains what they are all about: 
“WikiLeaks specializes in the analysis and publication of large datasets of censored or otherwise restricted official materials involving war, spying, and corruption. It has so far published more than 10 million documents and associated analyses.” 
In the 11 years that they’ve been publishing documents, they have not been disproven a single time. Their record for authentication is perfect. (Learn more here and here .) 
So this means that a person would be pretty silly to disregard anything in the reams of information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, the Clinton Foundation, and the political shenanigans that would put the Machiavellis to shame. 
Here are 21 of the most important things that have come out about Hillary Clinton, that unfortunately, no one is reporting on in the mainstream. In the interest of brevity, each topic has a link to an article that goes deeper into the leak. (In no particular order.) John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign had a nice cozy dinner with Peter Kadzik, one of the top officials in the Department of Justice…the day after the Benghazi hearing . Kadzik’s son also asked for a job on the Clinton campaign, and, the icing on the corruption cupcake? Kadzik led the effort to nominate Loretta Lynch, who famously met with Bill Clinton on her private plane right before Hillary’s interrogation about Emailgate. ( source ) We all knew that the Clinton Foundation was just a way for the Clinton family to launder money, and now there’s proof. Zero Hedge writes, “…today’s Wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals, for the first time, the precise financial flows between the Clinton Foundation, Band’s firm Teneo Consulting, and the Clinton family’s private business endeavors.” A pundit called this leak “The Rosetta Stone of the Clinton Foundation,” meaning that with this document, all of their shady financial dealings could be unraveled and translated. ( source ) Clinton is unable to speak for very long without a podium to lean on . Numerous leaked emails reference how certain interviews have to be kept short because she’d be without one. And this article references a very interesting reason why this may be the case – surprisingly it isn’t related to her health. ( source ) The leaks also show that Clinton intends to do her best to restrict the Second Amendment. Brian Fallon, the national press secretary for the Clinton campaign, wrote, “ Circling back around on guns as a follow up to the Friday morning discussion: the Today show has indicated they definitely plan to ask bout guns, and so to have the discussion be more of a news event than her previous times discussing guns, we are going to background reporters tonight on a few of the specific proposals she would support as President – universal background checks of course, but also closing the gun show loophole by executive order and imposing manufacturer liability .” According to an analysis on The Daily Sheeple, “Imposing manufacturer liability means that after Sandy Hook, Bushmaster and Remington Arms would have been prosecuted for having a hand in the murder of children and school staff members for firearms that were legally sold.” ( source ) The campaign was concerned that the sexual escapades of Bill Clinton could be likened to those of another disgraced celebrity, Bill Cosby . Political operative Ron Klain sent an urgent email saying that Hillary should anticipate the following questions, ” How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did? Is his conduct relevant to your campaign? You said every woman should be believed. Why not the women who accused him? Will you apologize to the women who were wrongly smeared by your husband and his allies?” ( source ) Clinton’s campaign deliberately leaked an embarrassing photo of a swimsuit-clad Bernie Sanders to the press, ironically insinuating that it was proof he was bought off by Wall Street. Perez Hilton wrote, “ Bernie Sanders lounges at elite Martha’s Vineyard pool, summer 2015 after helping raise money from Wall Street lobbyists .” ( source ) Clinton admitted she is out of touch with the middle class in a speech to Goldman-Black Rock in 2014. “And I am not taking a position on any policy, but I do think there is a growing sense of anxiety and even anger in the country over the feeling that the game is rigged. And I never had that feeling when I was growing up. Never. I mean, were there really rich people, of course there were. My father loved to complain about big business and big government, but we had a solid middle class upbringing. We had good public schools. We had accessible health care. We had our little, you know, one-family house that, you know, he saved up his money, didn’t believe in mortgages. So I lived that. And now, obviously, I’m kind of far removed because the life I’ve lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy , but I haven’t forgotten it.” ( source ) She made this rather NWO remark at a 2013 paid speech to Brazilian bank Banco Itau: “ My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders , some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.” ( source ) In a leak of yet another paid speech, this time to the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago in 2013, Clinton said that Jordan and Turkey “ can’t possibly vet all those refugees so they don’t know if, you know, jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees.” Meanwhile, if Clinton has her way , we will be warmly welcoming 65,000 refugees a year, which makes Obama’s 10,000 a year look like small potatoes. ( source ) Clinton blackmailed the Chinese by telling them that the US would base missiles in the region if they didn’t exert some control over North Korean aggression. “ So China, come on. You either control them or we’re going to have to defend against them ,” she purportedly told the audience at a Goldman Sachs conference in June 2013. ( source ) In May 2015, Clinton was no longer Secretary of State but was ready to announce she was running for President when she was invited to attend a summit in Morrocco. The implication from the leaked emails was that a $12 million “donation” from the king of Morocco was dependent on Clinton attending the summit. Human Abedin, usually loyal to her boss, had concerns . “ If HRC was not part of it, meeting was a non-starter. She created this mess and she knows it. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,” Abedin wrote to Robbie Mook in a November 2014 email. Incidentally, Clinton didn’t attend. Bill and Chelsea went instead and the $12 million donation was not forthcoming. (source ) Podesta attacked Clinton’s primary election rival Bernie Sanders for criticizing the Paris climate change agreement. “ Can you believe that doofus Bernie attacked it? ” said Podesta. ( source ) Clinton told a Goldman Sachs conference she would like to intervene secretly in Syria . “ My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene,” she told employees of the bank in South Carolina, which had paid her about $225,000 to give a speech. “We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now, you know, everybody can’t help themselves. They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else: Look what we’re doing and I want credit for it. ” (source ) There is indeed a definite link between the Clinton campaign and what MSM is allowed to say. The campaign has colluded directly with media spokespersons that read like a Who’s Who in American Media : Dan Merica from CNN, Haim Saban of Univision, John Harwood of CNBC and the NY Times, Rebecca Quick of CNBC, Maggie Haberman of NY Times and Politico, John Harris of Politico, Donna Brazile formerly of CNN, Roland Martin of TV-One, Marjorie Pritchard of The Boston Globe, and Louise Mensch of Heat Street. ( source ) As everyone knows, the DNC deliberately screwed Bernie Sanders out of the nomination ( Bonus: Wikileaks also released some of the DNC’s voicemails on the topic ). There are emails that prove who is actually pulling HRC’s puppet strings and that puppeteer is George Soros . The shadow government is not just a conspiracy theory – it really exists and Hillary’s job is to keep George Soros happy. ( source ) Excerpts from her speeches to Wall Street read like a guide to two-faced treachery. In them, she clearly points out that sometimes you “need” to lie. “If everybody’s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.” ( source ) Wikileaks emails show that back when she still worked for CNN and before she became an employee of the Clinton campaign, Donna Brazile gave Hillary the questions in advance for her “impromptu” CNN Town Hall questions. ( source ) The campaign got to “approve” articles in influential publications like NY Times, HuffPo, CNN, NBC, CBS, NYT, MSNBC, and Politico, showing a massive collusion with the mainstream media, who has hounded Trump relentlessly in an effort to distract from HRC’s abysmal candidacy. ( source ) Through the treasure trove of Wikileaks emails, we can gain an accurate picture of how Hillary really feels about us all (spoiler: basket of deplorables, basement dwellers and right wing conspirators) ( source ) President Obama knew the whole time that her emails were not coming from the secure State Department server. Cheryl Mills wrote to John Podesta, “W e need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov .” You see, Obama’s emails all have to be from”whitelisted”addresses. So someone, somewhere, added her nonsecure email to his whitelist. ( source ) 
And finally, here’s the real reason that treacherous shrew is involved in politics. And let me tell you, it isn’t because she yearns to make things better for anyone but herself. (emphasis mine.) 
At the Goldman Sachs Builders and Innovators Summit, Clinton responded to a question from chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, who quipped that you “go to Washington” to “make a small fortune.” Clinton agreed with the comment and complained about ethics rules that require officials to divest from certain assets before entering government. “ There is such a bias against people who have led successful and/or complicated lives, ” Clinton said. ( source ) Together, we cannot be ignored. 
I am on a mission between now and the Presidential Election on November 8th and I hope that you will join me. 
I am going to work day and night to provide the coverage that the mainstream media is not. It isn’t until we combine all of our voices that we can make people listen to the scandals, the rigging, and the corruption, not only in this election but in the system in general.

20546,20546,Novak Djokovic Loses to Sam Querrey in Third Round of Wimbledon - The New York Times,Christopher Clarey,"WIMBLEDON, England  —   Having won the first two sets against the Serbian star Novak Djokovic before the rain came, Sam Querrey had a long night at Wimbledon to consider the prospect of one of the biggest upsets in recent tennis history. He now has a lifetime to savor it, while Djokovic can ponder the Grand Slam that got away. Querrey, a    Californian with a thunderclap serve and forehand, handled the mounting pressure and a total of four rain delays with surprising aplomb to close out his stunning   (6)       (5) victory in the third round on Saturday. Above all, he handled the   Djokovic, who has been in the deepest of grooves, having won 30 straight Grand Slam singles matches and four straight Grand Slam tournaments, including, last month, the French Open for the first time. “Definitely the biggest win I’ve ever had,” Querrey said. “But there’s another match after this, so hopefully I can keep it going, make a quarterfinal of a Slam, which I’ve never done before. ” And yet this was not the same   Djokovic who has deflected power and cruised through many a draw in the past two seasons. “It’s an amazing feeling, obviously, to be able to hold four Grand Slams at the same time,” Djokovic said. “Coming into Wimbledon, obviously, here I knew that mentally it’s not going to be easy to kind of remotivate myself. But the importance of this tournament is so immense that you always find ways to really get inspired and prepare and try to give your best. Obviously, my best wasn’t good enough this year. ” Last year, Djokovic dodged a similar sort of danger in the fourth round at Wimbledon when he rallied from a   deficit over two days to win against another tall,   and   opponent: Kevin Anderson of South Africa. But the   Querrey, relaxed enough between big points to keep flipping his racket in the air and catching it by the grip, was able to slam the escape hatch that Anderson had left ajar. Querrey finished with 31 aces against Djokovic, the world’s premier returner, and dominated in the short rallies, winning 124 points out of 220 in exchanges of fewer than five strokes. “I think Sam has got a really, really tricky game for anybody to play against,” said his coach, Craig Boynton. “He serves huge, and when he’s taking his full cuts at the ball, he’s not going to give you any rhythm. ” Boynton’s other pupil, Steve Johnson, also reached the fourth round, earning a shot at a major upset of his own against Roger Federer. Querrey is scheduled to face the unseeded Frenchman Nicolas Mahut. “It seemed to me Novak was a little bit off, a little edgy,” Boynton said. “A lot of people don’t understand how hard it is for these top guys. What they have to do, day in and day out, is incredible, but look: Novak is going to lose at some point. He’s human. ” Djokovic looked particularly mortal in the early and closing stages of this match, which stretched over two days because of the rain that has continued to rewrite the Wimbledon schedule. Djokovic had not lost before the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament since the 2009 French Open, where Philipp Kohlschreiber beat him in the third round. But on Friday, Djokovic appeared listless and tactically adrift in the second set before play was called off. Though he came back stronger on Saturday, jumping out to a   lead in the third set before play was again stopped because of rain, he faltered with a fifth set in plain view. Djokovic served for the fourth set at   and was unable to close it out. He then lost a   lead in the tiebreaker with a series of uncharacteristic errors as Querrey reeled off six of the next eight points, including the one that mattered most when Djokovic made an unforced forehand error on Querrey’s second match point. Querrey, hardly the most demonstrative of men, celebrated with a leaping scissor kick and a fist pump and then hustled to the net to shake the hand of Djokovic, the champion who had beaten him in eight of their nine previous matches and had blown past him,       in the third round of the 2014 United States Open. Djokovic classily flashed him a   before the handshake. “What makes him so good is he wins those matches where he isn’t playing his best,” Querrey said of Djokovic. “Definitely, yesterday in the second, he lost some momentum. He wasn’t playing like he usually does. Today, I mean, he made me earn it. He’s not a guy that goes away. He made me come out and win those big points. Probably not the best he’s ever played, but not the worst he’s ever played. ” Wimbledon used to be a garden party away from home for the American men. John McEnroe won three titles here in the 1980s, and Pete Sampras won seven in the 1990s and 2000. Andy Roddick reached three finals in the 2000s. But the current generation of American men, led by John Isner and Querrey, has not had nearly that sort of success at Wimbledon  —   or at any other major tournament. The    Querrey, for all his big weapons, was only   in Grand Slam singles matches before his match with Djokovic on Court 1 on Saturday and had to rally from a   deficit in the first round here before beating Lukas Rosol,   in the fifth set. But he has a winning record now, along with a victory for the time capsule. “It’s not career defining, but it’s really exciting,” he said. “It’s something that I’ll always get to have, which is great. ” Djokovic had played no official tournaments on grass this season before arriving at Wimbledon, but then he had played no official tournaments on grass before he won the titles in 2011, 2014 and 2015. But winning a   title like the French Open can be draining in an unexpected way, and there is clearly a cumulative effect on any great champion from all the pressure resisted and upset bids thwarted. In this case, there was also the pressure of a potential Grand Slam  —   winning all four major titles in the same season  —   which no man has done since Rod Laver in 1969. Djokovic won the first two legs, at the Australian Open and the French Open, but the suspense did not last past the first week at Wimbledon. “I don’t think it played as big of a factor, to be honest,” Djokovic said. “Coming into this match, I knew that it’s going to be very close, not easy to break his serve. If he’s on a roll, as he was, it’s really hard to read his serve. He hits his spots really well. And whenever he had a chance from the rally, he was going for the shots. ” But Djokovic has snuffed out many a huge server in his career. The problem against Querrey was that he was not effective enough on his own serve. His   and   speeds are down significantly from a year ago. His winning percentage on his second serve  —   54. 3 percent for the tournament  —   was his lowest at Wimbledon since 2008, and he was able to win only 65 percent of the points on his first serves against Querrey. He finished with 34 winners to 31 unforced errors and a drawn face that perhaps reflected deeper concerns. Asked if he was 100 percent healthy, Djokovic answered: “Not really, but you know, it’s not the place and time to talk about it. Again, the opponent was playing on a very high level, and he deserved to win. ” Acknowledging that you are not 100 percent healthy is not quite giving full credit to the man who just ended your Wimbledon hopes. Querrey, a mellow man in a fraught microcosm, did not complain. He has had his own share of injuries and missed opportunities. At age 19, he reached the third round in his first Australian Open in 2007. Bigger Grand Slam success seemed only a matter of time. But the path has been more arduous than he might have suspected, and there have been major roadblocks in the form of Djokovic, Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. “Those guys are just   really good,” Boynton said. “It’s not that our guys aren’t good, but you’re talking to me right now because Novak lost, and it doesn’t happen that often. And there’s a reason it doesn’t happen. To get through that bubble has been very difficult, but Sam got through it today. ”",0

by Missy Marston, 
The first time I channeled my sister was also the first day I watched “ The Secret “. 
I had spent most of that day and the night looking at the stars and asking the universe to help me open my third eye and talk to my sister. And it heard me! It was around two in the morning and I went inside to read an article my mother had left up for me. I kept getting the same phrase over and over in my head – Everything you need is inside of you, you just have to ask for it. 
I took the hint, grabbed a pen and paper, and wrote it down. When I was done writing, my hand wasn’t. It kept writing. I was exhilarated, terrified, and full of love and peace all at the same time. 
There was no question at first; there was this knowingness of what was happening and whom I was channeling without asking. It was my sister! Thank you, universe! 
She passed along some messages of love and thanks to the family, told me to get my shit together, and began the process of educating me and keeping my mind open. 
“Everything is possible with just your mind!” 
Tina wrote that she could always hear those who speak to her, and that she’s been constantly trying to speak to us . She was very adamant about self-discovery through meditation in order to first visualize her, and second to transcend ! All we have to do is ask the universe, believe it will be, and keep our minds open through journeying into the self . ‘ That’s how strong your brain is!! You can do it if you can will it. You have the universe at your fingertips! ’ 
“We have so much to do, Missy!” 
Christina wants to change the world, because Christina can change the world. Besides opening up our minds and asking the universe for help, we need to eliminate needs and focus on the inner-self . She said the inner-self is all there is. We can change the world by gaining power over our knowledge and intuition; Learning what truly matters in both the world and your self and feeding our sixth sense until it reaches its full potentia l. ‘Intuition is your best friend. Talk to it. Listen to it. It’s how you knew to grab a notepad. It’s how you know it’s me.’ 
“You get it?” 
I asked Tina if I would always have this connection to her, and she wrote that we are one. So I’m thinking that we’re somehow the same soul, and she corrected me. She said we are ‘soul bound’ to each other. 
She says I’ve done this a million times before! We’ve known each other outside of Christina – I was always the mouthpiece and she is the mouth. 
As Christina said: ‘Just let yourself be filled with love; it is the fuel for your mind.’ 
What peace it brings to know your loved ones are near and listening! And what joy it brings to know it’s possible to hear them!

20548,20548,The #NeverTrump’s Final Plan: ‘Elect And Impeach’,Robert Gehl,"We keep calling it their “last, desperate gasp for air” before sinking to the surface, never to rise again. 
But rise they do –over and over again. 
I’m speaking about the “NeverTrump” movement that tried desperately to get anyone besides Donald Trump at the top of the GOP ticket and failed. 
We last heard from them right before the GOP national convention, when they suggested the electors might commit what amounts to mutiny and vote for someone other than Trump as their nominee. 
Now that the election is just days away, they seem to have come up with one last ditch – and certifiably insane way to keep Donald J. Trump out of the Oval Office: 
Elect, then impeach. 
That’s their big plan. Elect Trump as president of the United States, then turn around and have him impeached, tried and booted from office, leaving us with a much more palatable Mike Pence as President. 
Our friends at The Federalist first floated this idea Tuesday and while they acknowledge it’s a near impossibility, it shows just how desperate they are to keep Mr. Trump from the White House. 
There is a way out of this mess. It is a desperate plan, but desperate times, desperate measures: Elect-and-Impeach. Elect the ticket. Impeach Trump. 
The Republican Party does have an attractive candidate on its ticket. Socially conservative. Economically conservative. Conservative on national defense. Morally and religiously impeccable. The trouble is, that man is the Republican candidate for vice president, Mike Pence. 
But if Trump were impeached immediately after he took office, the Republican candidate for vice president would become president in his place. Further, if Republicans take the lead in removing Trump from office, the party might regain some of its lost credibility in parts of the electorate that it is anxious to attract. 
Jonathan Asbach , who is a PhD student at the prestigious Hillsdale College, thinks that while this would be a difficult plan, it’s not impossible. The GOP is at odds with its own nominee. If enough of them are willing to cross party lines to vote for impeachment, it could be done. 
Then there’s the problem of what to charge Trump with. He must be guilty of “high crimes and misdemeanors,” according to the Constitution. Asbach argues that “if Trump is half as corrupt as we have been told, surely some charge could be made to stick—especially if the recent allegations of sexual assault prove to be more than empty propaganda.” 
Elect-and-Impeach offers conservatives precisely what they want: A solid conservative president far better than either of the two major-party candidates. He’s far better, for that matter, than either of the two leading third-party candidates who have attracted attention as magnets for protest votes. 
There are two steps for this to actually happen, he writes. First, the GOP would have to grow a spine. “Republican congressmen and senators must pledge to take on the unsavory job of impeaching their own candidate the moment he becomes president,” Asbach writes. “As this is by far the least-bad option that Republican leaders have, they should be willing to step up to the plate. 
Second, all the GOP voters who have abandoned the party because of Trump would have to return to the flock, actually vote for the candidate knowing that “it is not really him you are voting for, then… lobby your senator and congressman to do their part and remove Trump from the head of it.” 
There is a potential for dawn after the dark night of the 2016 electoral season. There is a very real possible future in which Pence is the president of the United States, in which the country is in safe, responsible, conservative hands. It would also be one in which the Supreme Court is saved from the lawless ruffians who want to rewrite the Constitution as they see fit. 
But for that future to be realized, Republicans have to work together, and they have to do so quickly. Inertia is our greatest obstacle. This has never been done before. That makes it seem like it cannot be done. But America cannot afford our complacency. This is our last chance to prevent impending electoral catastrophe. 
So this is a plea to conservative leaders and conservative voters: Do your part. Make the pledge. Cast the vote. Help make Elect-and-Impeach a reality. 
Just when I thought the #NeverTrumpers had quieted down, they come up with this plan. 
I have to hand it to them – it’s certainly different . 
It will never, ever, work. But it shows the complete desperation that some folks have about the prospect of Donald Trump as president of the United States.",1
20549,20549,Pakistan: Long arm of ISI needs unsheathing,Brig Asif H. Raja,"By Brig Asif H. Raja on November 1, 2016 
Asif Haroon Raja 
The ISI had developed its long arm capability during the tenures of Gen Akhtar Abdur Rehman, Lt Gen Hamid Gul (VT editor) and Lt Gen Javed Nasir as DG ISI. It was owing to this capability of hitting the chosen target outside the frontiers of Pakistan that the ISI earned the reputation of a dreaded outfit and the best in Asia. The long arm began to shrivel when Benazir Bhutto was PM from 1988 to 1990 and Gen Waheed Kakar was COAS and Lt Gen Javed Ashraf Qazi had replaced Gen Javed Nasir. This change in posture was a result of pressure of the US and the West, pressing Pakistan to refrain from meddling in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) and in India, or else it will be declared a terrorist state. Pressure was mounted at the behest of India which had become strategic partner of USA and Israel in 1991/1992 and darling of the West. 
After the occupation of Afghanistan by 1, 50,000 Soviet forces in December 1979, Pakistan under Gen Ziaul Haq had decided to provide refuge to about 5 million Afghan refugees and to support the Afghan Mujahideen in their resistance. The US came forward with a package of $ 3.5 billion in June 1981 after making a measured assessment that Pakistan had the will and capability to fight the proxy war. The offer was accepted only when it was conveyed that the ISI will coordinate and conduct the entire war without the aid of CIA and that the US and others would restrict their support to provision of funds and weapons/equipment only. As a Frontline State, Pakistan suffered a great deal throughout the Afghan war at the hands of KGB-KHAD-RAW-AlZulfiqar nexus and Afghan armed forces, but achieved the miracle by defeating and pushing out Soviet forces in February 1989. After achieving its objective without employing a single soldier, the US abandoned Pakistan as well as the Mujahideen who had sacrificed 1.5 million people and had helped the US in becoming a sole super power. 
Once Pakistan fell from the grace of USA and it was put under sanctions on account of its covert nuclear program suspected to be geared towards making an Islamic bomb, it came under the shadow of black star. Pakistan’s nuclear program became an eyesore for India, Israel and USA. It faced the whole brunt of fallout effects of ten-year Afghan war that had been fully supported by the US led free world. USSR that had shrunk to Russian Federation was highly bitter, while India was perpetually hostile. Iran was not so friendly owing to its reservations over the developments in Afghanistan. Explosive situation in Afghanistan due to civil war and power tussle among the seven Mujahideen groups impacted the security of Pakistan. 
Start of armed insurgency in IOK in late 1989 and India pumping in over 700,000 troops into the Valley had its effects on Pakistan’s security dynamics. In 1990/91, both sides had come close to war. Internally, the society had become militarized due to the Afghan war and sectarianism fomented by Iran and Saudi Arabia had created serious law and order situation in Punjab. PPP and PML-N acrimoniously tussled with each other for power because of which no govt could complete its mandatory 5 years tenure. 
Fragmentation of USSR and demise of communism on account of its military defeat in Afghanistan and increase of influence of Pakistan and India decreasing its influence in Afghanistan had vexed India. It feared that Pakistan may exploit the situation in IOK and liberate it with the help of over 60 Jihadi groups and take its revenge of the humiliation it had suffered in East Pakistan in 1971. It dreaded that Pakistan may replicate its model of supporting the Mukti Bahini. Sensing the gravity of the situation, India started propagating that Pakistan is behind the insurgency in IOK and that the ISI is funding, training and launching terrorists from Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK). It urged the UN and world powers to rein in Pakistan and restrain ISI from conducting cross LoC terrorism. 
The US, both Republicans and Democrats, had been constantly wooing India to join its camp since early 1950s, but India preferred the Soviet camp, although it professed to be non-aligned. It was elated when India feeling orphaned after the collapse of USSR fell like a ripe apple into the waiting arms of USA and both became bedfellows in 1991. Once its newfound love sought help from her paramour, the latter stood behind her and sternly cautioned Pakistan to lay its hands off IOK. Change in circumstances compelled Pakistan to restrict its support to the Kashmiris in distress to moral, political and diplomatic levels only. The Kashmir oriented Jihadi groups based in AJK and in Southern Punjab however continued to extend support to the Kashmiris seeking right of self-determination as provided for in the UN resolutions. Indian security forces equipped with draconian laws and license to kill without any fear of accountability or censure by the UN and world powers carried out inhuman torture, employed massive force, and used rape as a weapon to break the will of the freedom fighters. The UN and international community turned a deaf ear to the cries of Kashmiris. 
Despite the fact that IOK had become the most militarized region of the world (one soldier for 17 civilians), and Kashmiris had suffered over 100,000 fatalities, 10,000 rapes, detention of thousands in secret dens and destruction of their property, the freedom fighters kept the torch of liberty aglow. The heroics of Kashmiris against heavy odds had a telling effect on the morale of Indian Army and paramilitary forces in IOK. Soldiers suffered from demoralization and homesickness; cases of suicides, desertions, killing of seniors and comrades by soldiers, and indiscipline jumped up at an alarming rate. Officers and men dreaded posting to Kashmir, while rate of compassionate cases wanting posting out from Kashmir shot up. A stage came when recruitment in Army dropped to rock bottom levels. The then Indian Army chief had to appear on the TV and run an ad campaign to appeal to the youth to join the Army on better pay scale and perks. Kashmir had become a perforated wound for India and economic cost was becoming unbearable. It was becoming difficult for India to hide its massive human rights violations and barbarities of Indian security forces. 
Here I may add that the Indian Army had suffered humiliation at Dras-Kargil in 1999 at the hands of handful of Mujahideen and irregulars of Northern Light Infantry. It was eventually bailed out by the US led G-8 by exerting immense pressure on Pakistan to immediately vacate the captured territories. The Indian armed forces went through another embarrassment in 2002 when it had to sheepishly withdraw from its western border after a ten-month standoff during which it had constantly huffed and puffed but couldn’t pick up courage to cross the border. Aggressive response of Pak armed forces had taken the steam out of their chauvinism. 
Unfortunately, all that was gained on the Kashmir front and on the military front was wasted away after Gen Musharraf wilted under the US pressure in 2003 and decided to take steps to please USA and India. Reining in Kashmir focused Jihadi groups, allowing India to fence the LoC and signing peace treaty with India in January 2004 changed the perspective. It helped Indian military to suppress Kashmir freedom movement. Earlier on, Musharraf had submitted to all the 7 demands of Washington in September 2001. Free hand given to CIA and FBI had enabled the two to establish their network in FATA and gain control over airports and seaport in Pakistan. Intelligence acquisition in FATA was taken over by CIA and ISI pushed on the back seat. 
Indo-Pak peace treaty in 2004 enabled RAW to ignite FATA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Baluchistan and Karachi. While RAW assisted by CIA, NDS, MI-6 and Mossad made full use of its long arm to bleed Pakistan with the help of proxies, Pak security forces and ISI remained handicapped. The so-called friends pushed Pakistan to fight terrorism but secretly backed the terrorists. The US kept twisting the arm of Pakistan that if ISI meddled into India or Afghanistan it will be declared a rogue outfit. Perforce, the ISI undertook protective measures only, but its defensive actions were more often breached because the so-called allies stabbed Pakistan in the back. As a consequence, RAW and its strategic partners carried out one-sided covert war while the ISI at best tried to ward off the attacks. In spite of defensive policy of the govt and ISI, and Pakistan suffering much more human casualties than any other country in the war on terror, ISI was blamed to be in collusion with Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Haqqani Network, Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). These were termed as strategic assets of military establishment to overcome conventional inferiority against arch enemy India. The lost intelligence space In FATA/KP was gradually recovered when Lt Gen Shuja Pasha took over as DG ISI and Gen Ashfaq Kayani as COAS in 2008. 
All the terror attacks that took place in India between 2001 and 2008 were pinned on JeM and LeT and their connection was made with ISI. Since Pakistan made no effort to disprove Indian contention even after it was revealed by Indian investigative agencies and Home Ministry officials that Hindu terror groups and Indian military intelligence officers were involved in the attacks, it became easier for India to further strengthen its narrative of portraying Pakistan as a terror abetting state and a nursery of terrorism. India’s narrative was boosted up by its strategic allies. The US dubbed Pakistan as the most dangerous county in the world. Pakistan’s overall defensive policy and apologetic stance emboldened its detractors to keep whipping and bleeding it without fear of tit for tat response from ISI. 
Other than the salvos fired by the Indo-Afghan-US-Israel nexus on Pak Army and ISI, Pakistan political leadership of major political parties also view the two premier institutions with distrust. Both PPP and PML-N in line with their 2006 Charter of Democracy made efforts to enfeeble ISI and keep Army under their thumb. First attempt was made by Benazir Bhutto when she replaced Lt Gen Hamid Gul with retired Lt Gen Kallue in 1989 and next tasked Air Marshal Zulfiqar to cut ISI to size under the garb of reforms. PM Yusaf Raza Gilani tried to civilianize ISI in August 2008 by placing it under Ministry of Interior. Kerry Lugar Bill in 2009 and Memo scandal in 2011 were other attempts to curtail military’s power. Nawaz Sharif has a history of locking horns with every Army chief and has still not got out of the hangover of Gen Musharraf. Although he didn’t clash with Gen Raheel but at times civil-military relations became tense. 
It has now been conclusively established that RAW and NDS in unison and backed by other agencies are deeply involved in proxy war in Pakistan since 2003 and have inflicted tens of thousands of cuts on the body of Pakistan and its people. Series of conspiracies have been hatched and launched to destabilize and fragment Pakistan. RAW-NDS nexus backed by CIA is continuing to use Afghanistan as a launching pad for terror attacks in Pakistan. In order to scuttle CPEC, focus of attacks is on Baluchistan and KP. India is keeping the LoC on fire. So far it has violated 2003 ceasefire agreement 178 times and killed 19 civilians and injured 80. 
The anti-Pakistan foreign agencies are making full use of TTP, Jamaat Ahrar, Lashkar Jhangvi, BLA, BRA, BLF and MQM as proxies. London is a safe haven for MQM leadership and Baloch rebel leaders, while Afghanistan has provided sanctuaries to TTP runaway leaders in Kunar, Nuristan and Nangarhar. Besides these strategic assets, the detractors are also making use of NGOs, human rights activists and segment of media to make Pakistan a compliant state of India. Since HN, JeM, and LeT are not playing the game of foreign agencies, they are dubbed as terrorist groups and strategic assets of Pak Army/ISI. They want Pakistan to take strict action against them or else face isolation and sanctions. 
It was in the backdrop of this concern of US and India that the Dawn News published a story on October 6. The planted story was allegedly furnished by someone from within the PM House where a national security conference presided by the PM and attended by Foreign Secretary, Punjab Chief Minister, COAS, DG ISI and National Security Adviser was held. The invented story written by Cyril Almeida gave an impression of serious rift between civil and military leadership and that while the govt wanted to proceed against the defunct militant groups, the ISI didn’t. Probable motive of concocted story was to demean the Army/ISI and to reinforce Indo-US stance that Pak Army and ISI were in league with terror groups. The types of Hussain Haqqani, Ayesha Sadiqa, Farzana Bari and several other liberal journalists assembled in London two days ago to play up this story. MQM (Altaf) hosted them. To ascertain the truth, a high powered committee comprising members from three intelligence agencies will carry out inquest. 
Having collected tons of evidence, yet Pakistan takes the barbs and whips without a whimper and doesn’t pick up courage to strike back. The long arm of ISI remains sheathed for reasons best known to the policy makers. It implies our leaders have decided to give a free hand to our enemies to continue bleeding Pakistan without any fear of retaliation or even protest. Going by the well-established concept that ‘offence is the best defence’, until and unless the ISI pay back the RAW and NDS in the same coin, one sided bleeding of Pakistanis will continue. Long arm must be unsheathed.

20550,20550,Fresno State Student Transitions to a Male,Steve Byas,"Email 
“I’m trying to make this campus more aware,” said Jessica Adams, coordinator of LGBT services at the Cross Cultural and Gender Center at Fresno State University in California. “I’m asking most people to unlearn this concept of gender that they have been taught for years. And it’s not an easy task.” 
No doubt. Most people are “stuck” believing boys are boys and girls are girls. 
Adams argues that those who hold to such beliefs are the ones with the problem. She recently helped “Mr. Love” — a female who is “transitioning” to a male — become one of the first of these “transgender” students at Fresno State to change her name on her student ID card. This is considered “a huge victory” by Adams because, she claimed, “You feel fraudulent as a person, yet no one is allowing you to be who you are. If you can imagine being called the wrong name for the rest of your life, or even for a day.… If you kept telling them and they refused to acknowledge that, that’s painful.” 
“Mr. Love” is transitioning by taking natural supplements, rather than testosterone injections. But this is not her first “transition.” In the past, she was, at one time, “bisexual,” and has suffered from anxiety and depression. In fact, Mr. Love (shown) reacted to the tragic news that 49 people were murdered by an Islamic terrorist in Orlando by considering suicide. 
“It was all just too much,” Mr. Love recalled. “I wanted to die.” One survey has found that more than 40 percent of transgender people have attempted suicide. In a study conducted by The New Atlantis , sex “reassigned individuals were about 5 times more likely to attempt suicide and about 19 times more likely to die by suicide.” Whatever the exact figures, it is obvious that these are deeply mentally disturbed individuals. 
After writing a suicide note to some friends, Mr. Love was forced into an ambulance and transported to a mental health center in Fresno. But what really upset her was when she looked down and saw the name on the plastic medical bracelet. They had use Mr. Love’s birth name, instead of Mr. Love. 
It was an Aztec female name, meaning “goddess of music and dance.” 
Mr. Love explained, “You have to realize every time you say it, it’s going to be like knives to the heart.” 
To those in the “transgender community,” birth names that identify the person as male, when he wants to be known as a female, or identify the person as female (as in the case of Mr. Love) when a transgender individual wishes to be known as a male, are referred to as “dead names.” 
Sometimes Mr. Love uses the name of Alex, because it is more gender neutral. 
When Mr. Love was a high-school student at Clovis United, the school board refused to adopt a gender-neutral dress code. Boys and girls who supported the transgender students swapped clothes as a protest against school policy. Although no federal statute exists that requires local school districts to allow transgender males into girl’s locker rooms, and vice-versa, the Obama administration has told schools across the country they will either do so, or face the loss of federal funds. 
The Charlotte Observer recently editorialized in favor of allowing transgenders to use the bathroom they identify with, and not their biologically appropriate one. The paper dismissed concerns that sexual predators could use trangender-oriented “bathroom laws. Besides, the paper lectured, “The thought of male genitalia in girls’s locker rooms — and vice versa — might be distressing to some. But the battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort.” 
So according to the Charlotte Observer , anyone who opposes a naked boy strolling into a shower full of naked girls is no better than a segregationist. After all, it was discomforting to a white bigot to be around black people, and opposition to transgenders using the bathroom of the opposite sex, well, that is a bigoted stance, too. 
Of course, a similar opposing argument would have just as much, or more, logical validity: Maybe transgenders should get used to the ""discomfort"" of being naked around their own biological sex and that to do otherwise, and force their nakedness on the unwilling, opposite sex, is akin to sexual assault. 
Although Mr. Love wants to be recognized as a man, she wants to keep her mezzo-soprano voice (considered one of the highest female singing voices). “I’ve come to terms with my voice. My voice is everything, it’s all I have,” Mr. Love said. 
Mr. Love insists that she is a man, trapped in a biological woman’s body, and that she cannot help it. “I didn’t ask for this life. I didn’t choose it. I really didn’t.” 
But a recent study in The New Atlantis journal concluded that trangenderism is not supported by the science. The report was co-authored by Dr. Paul McHugh, who is the former Chief of Pyschiatry at Johns Hopkins University. “Examining research from the biological, psychological, and social sciences, this report shows that some of the most frequently heard claims about sexuality and gender are not supported by scientific evidence. The hypothesis that gender identiy is an innate, fixed property of human beings that is independent of biological sex — that a person might be ‘a man trapped in a woman’s body’ or ‘a woman trapped in a man’s body’ — is not supported by scientific evidence,” insisted the researchers. 
But it is not just that the acceptance of transgenderism (one will note that the mainstream media dutifully calls a transgender person by the pronoun that person prefers) is unscientific. The report argues that such enabling is harmful. “An area of particular concern involves medical interventions for gender-nonconforming youth. They are increasingly receiving therapies that affirm their felt genders, and even hormone treatments or surgical modifications at young ages.” 
In a statement released in March by the American College of Pediatricians, a similar conclusion was reached. The report was entitled “Gender Ideology Harms Children,” and in it, they assert that taking “gender dysphoria” as anything other than a psychological problem is harmful. 
One woman, Cari Stella, took to YouTube to describe how this ideologically driven movement harmed her. “I am a real, live 22-year-old woman, with a scarred chest and a broken voice, and five o’clock shadow because I couldn’t face the idea of growing up to be a woman. That’s my reality.… When I was transitioning, I felt a strong desire — what I could have called a ‘need’ at the time — to transition.” 
But the transition only worsened her mental health. “Testosterone made me even more disassociated than I already was.” 
Stella’s situation is an example of an observation made in The New Atlantis study: “The potential that patients undergoing medical and surgical sex reassignment may want to return to a gender identity consistent with their biological sex suggests that reassignment carries considerable psychological and physical risk.” The report concluded that the promotion of transgenderism is influenced more by politics and the culture than by science. 
On the Carol Burnett Show , Vikki Lawrence once performed a skit where she portrayed a mother with an infant child. When someone asked the common question, “Is the baby a boy or a girl?” Lawrence effected offense, answering, “This is 1970! The baby can make that decision at age 21.” 
Of course, the audience predictably guffawed at the absurdity of it all. But that was 1970. Now, in 2016, such a skit on television would probably lead to boycotts and condemnations from our modern “progressive” society.  ",1
20551,20551,Hackers Demand Ransom Payment from Disney over Stolen Copy of ’Pirates of the Caribbean 5’,Daniel Nussbaum,"Hackers have stolen Disney’s upcoming film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales and have threatened to release it online unless the studio pays the thieves a hefty ransom, according to reports. [Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed Monday at a town hall meeting with ABC employees in New York City that one of the studio’s upcoming films had been stolen, but did not specify which film, according to the Hollywood Reporter.  Deadline reported later Monday that the film in question is the studio’s upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean, the fifth film in the swashbuckling pirates franchise starring Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. The studio is working with the FBI to identify the source of the hack. The hackers have reportedly threatened to release portions of the film online until their ransom demand is met. THR reported that the hackers planned to release the first five minutes of the film and then continue on with   increments until payment is made. Sources told Deadline that Disney is not currently planning to pay the ransom, though the studio has not yet commented publicly on the situation. The Disney hack comes as studios and production outfits have dealt with increasing security threats presented by hackers. Even if hacking groups cannot access private files on the server of a major studio like Disney, they can attack   outfits or other   firms that possess copies of private material and that have weaker security measures than major companies. In April, a group of hackers calling themselves The Dark Overlord infiltrated Netflix and released all ten episodes of the streaming giant’s hit series Orange is the New Black, after the company refused to meet the group’s ransom demand. That group also said it possessed stolen copies of other television shows including Celebrity Apprentice and NCIS: Los Angeles. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales is due out in theaters May 26.   Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum",0

20553,20553,"As Anthem-Protesting Colin Kaepernick’s Free Agency Goes Nowhere, Sports Writer Searches for Answers - Breitbart",Warner Todd Huston,"After spending half the season perpetrating an   protest against the national anthem, NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick announced his free agency. But, with teams snapping up players, Kaepernick has thus far gone ignored by the NFL. Now, sports writer Mike Freeman, searching for a reason for the player’s fall, ultimately decided that Kaepernick is being punished for “the crime of speaking his mind. ”[For BleacherReport. com, Mike Freeman seems gobsmacked that no team has come forward to offer the 49ers   quarterback a new birth.  With his analysis, Freeman seems to blame the country and the NFL for being racist for not allowing Kaepernick to have unlimited success and untold accolades. Freeman also proclaims that Kaepernick is being punished for “the crime of speaking his mind. ” The San Francisco quarterback became the talk of the league this season with his   protests by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem at the start of each game. But, just as Kaepernick declared his free agency he also announced the abrupt end of his refusal to stand for the anthem. With the league’s free agents signing to teams at a quickening pace, Kaepernick has thus far gone unsigned. Kaepernick, once considered an up and coming player with a bright future, helped lead the 49ers to the Super Bowl in 2012 only a year after he went pro, and then led the team to an NFC Championship the following year. Since then his playing has declined. After several seasons of lackluster play, rumors circled that the 49ers would trade him ahead of the   season. Freeman even notes that some football analysts feel Kaepernick has lost a step, saying, “some teams genuinely believe that he can’t play. They think he’s shot. I’d put that number around 20 percent. ” But Freeman goes on to claim that Kaepernick has become toxic mostly because of his   protests: Second, some teams fear the backlash from fans after getting him. They think there might be protests or [President Donald] Trump will tweet about the team. I’d say that number is around 10 percent. Then there’s another 10 percent that has a mix of those feelings. Third, the rest genuinely hate him and can’t stand what he did [kneeling for the national anthem]. They want nothing to do with him. They won’t move on. They think showing no interest is a form of punishment. I think some teams also want to use Kaepernick as a cautionary tale to stop other players in the future from doing what he did. One executive even reportedly told Freeman that Kaepernick is “an embarrassment to football. ” Freeman does admit that teams may just be waiting for the most advantageous time to bid for Colin’s services. But, he thinks that what is happening to Kaepernick is “highly unusual. ” It all adds up to little interest in the player, “and that’s putting it kindly” Freeman writes. Freeman does add a long list of reasons people have criticized Kaepernick for his play, reasons that have nothing to do with his   protests. The writer says that some criticize Kaepernick’s throwing accuracy, others think he isn’t much of a team player because he is a moody loner, and still others say he seems out of his depth when asked to learn new schemes. Despite all the complaints about Kaepernick’s play and prickly personality, Freeman finds his lack of free agency opportunity shocking. Freeman writes: Still, it’s hard to emphasize how unusual Kaepernick’s current situation is. If a Super Bowl quarterback can walk and chew bubble gum simultaneously, he gets opportunities. Those opportunities usually arrive until that player is totally and completely done. That’s not the case with Kaepernick. So, why is Kaepernick being left behind? It’s all because everyone is punishing him for “the crime of speaking his mind,” Freeman thinks. Kaepernick’s new agents appear to have foreseen all of this, which is why it wasn’t surprising when sources told ESPN’s Adam Schefter that Kaepernick would start standing for the anthem. Now, he sits. Waiting and waiting. A   player whose political statement may have cost him his NFL career. With this, Freeman proves that, like many, he misunderstands freedom of speech. It is absolutely correct that Kaepernick has the right to say America has never been great, to slam our soldiers, the police, and other first responders, to tout Black Lives Matter and the like. But, it is the fans’ corresponding right to decide they don’t like him when he expresses those ideas. It is also highly logical for teams assessing Kaepernick’s free agency to decide they don’t want to bring his controversial views into their locker rooms and to assault their fans with his protests. Kaepernick has a right to speak out, but he doesn’t have a right to expect no repercussions from that speech. Consider the most perfect example of cause and effect concerning the topic of free speech, when country band the Dixie Chicks went on tirades overseas against the United States in the early 2000s Then, here at home they pretty much lost their fan base because of their   outbursts. Sure, the Dixie Chicks had a right to mouth off against the U. S. A. and no one said they didn’t have that right. But, fans also had the corresponding right to stop patronizing their musical product, and it wasn’t long before their musical career went from chart topping hits to invisible on the music scene. The reaction to Kaepernick, who said even worse things about the U. S. than the Dixie Chicks ever did, is entirely similar.

20554,20554,Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean,Daniel Greenfield,"Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean October 25, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
Brooding and bearded face shadowed by an odd hat, cutlass scars on his arms and a dark patch where his eye ought to be. The pirate is a familiar stereotype. Countless movies have worn him down to a smooth and unremarkable cliche. 
But what if that cliche has depths that have yet to be mined by the movie industry? 
That is the question that Israeli-American director Arnon Z. Shorr (Blood and Stone: A Legend of the Golem, A Modest Suggestion, Glimpse) has chosen to tap into with the Pirate Captain Toledano . Beneath the pirate's hat hides another sort of hat. A Jewish one. For the Pirate Captain Toledano is a Jewish pirate. What sort of Jew becomes a pirate and why? 
Touching on true history, that is one of the questions that Shorr's film proposes to answer. 
Recent years have seen growing interest in the history of Jewish pirates. And what initially seems absurd quickly becomes a fascinating exploration of how much of history is lost when legend becomes cliche. As a pioneering filmmaker, Arnon Z. Shorr has chosen to tackle this ambitious project with the aid of two vessels at the Ocean Institute, a dedicated cast and support from the public. 
Though the process of bringing the Pirate Captain Toledano from vision to reality has only begun, the journey has already been marked by fortuitous coincidences, including the discovery that cast member Stephen DeCordova (Captain Toledano) hailed from ancestors who were Jewish pirates and a treasured Kiddush cup in his possession, which likely dates back from those days, will play a key role in the story. 
Like the ocean, history has unseen depths and strange currents that can only be glimpsed from the right angle. Arnon Z. Shorr is currently laboring to bring up a lost piece of history from the deeps.",1

20556,20556,"Game Of Thrones Author Just Ripped Trump, Endorsed Hillary",Grant Stern,"Comments 
Author George R. R. Martin’s books inspired the hit HBO TV series Game of Thrones , and he’s no stranger to political intrigues. Even the legendary fantasy writer Martin never imagined an American demagogue, who could blithely step on every third rail of American politics and survive in the race until the general election. But the man who wrote television’s most hated character – Joffrey Baratheon – just took to his blog to explain definitively why Donald Trump will never be fit to sit on the Iron Throne be president. 
In my lifetime, there has never been a presidential candidate more unfit to lead this nation. 
You don’t need to like Hillary. You don’t need to listen to what Hillary says about Trump, or what I say about Trump. You just need to listen to Trump. If you can do that, and still consider voting for him… well… 
Martin’s book “Song of Fire and Ice” inspired the hit TV series, which is loosely based on the War of The Roses , as the warring clans of Westeros fight for control of the Iron Throne. For much of the series, the throne has been captured by golden haired Joffrey Baratheon, whose endless list of offensive behaviors begins as a callous child, and continues through his disastrous reign. Like the fictional boy-king, Donald Trump loves to sit on fancy, throne-like chairs and using his family’s wealth and influence to play at being king. 
The author Martin described the highly unusual nature of this year’s presidential election by zeroing in on the striking difference between negative advertisements for the two candidates. He shrewdly pointed out that Donald Trump’s attack ads are standard political ad hominem affairs – lots of selective editing and bluster, no substance – while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton doesn’t even create traditional attack ads. 
Martin’s list of the many Clinton attack ads doubles as a fine reason that nobody in their right mind, should choose the Republican nominee for President this upcoming Tuesday, November 8th: 
Hillary does not need to use the sort of hoary attack ads that Trump is using. She only needs to present him as he is, and let his own words condemn them. 
And they do. 
No one has to accuse Trump of anything, he has laid it all out there in public for the world to see. 
Yes, he mocked a disabled reporter. There he is, doing it. 
Yes, he told Billy Bush he liked to kiss women without their consent and grab them by their pussies. There he is, boasting about it. When you’re a star, you can do anything. 
No need to accuse Trump of going into the dressing rooms of Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pagaents when the contestants were changing so he could see them naked. There’s Trump himself, telling Howard Stern about it. 
Yes, he said women should be punished for having abortions. There he is, telling Chris Matthews. His own words, his own face. 
Yes, he said he wants to ban all Muslims from entering the US. Here, see the clip. 
Yes, he’s in favor of Japan and Saudi Arabia and South Korea having nukes, here’s the clip where he says so. 
And on and on and on and on. The Gold Star family, the bad hombres, Judge Curiel, the Miss Universe contestant… his own speeches, his own tweets, his own words. 
Martin even remarked that for a man whose campaign resembles a nastier version of George Wallace, it is eerily starting to look like his braggadocious claim was correct, when in January, Trump said he could shoot a man on Fifth Avenue in New York and get away with it. If there’s any one moment in the Republican’s campaign that could be described as Joffrey-esqe, that was the one, where like the fictional, twisted boy king , Donald Trump reveled openly in a threat to kill senselessly, and kill with impunity. 
The dastardly character Joffrey’s Uncle described him in a way that anyone watching Donald Trump might describe the oddly coiffed Republican candidate, “We’ve had vicious kings, and we’ve had idiot kings, but I don’t think we’ve ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king!” 
The same harsh words equally apply to Republican nominee Donald Trump’s disastrous fall as the standard bearer of his failed party, the GOP. 
We agree with George R. R. Martin, all any voter needs to do is listen rationally to the irrational Trump speak, and realize that he’s not Presidential material, and has a personality only fit to be an erratic boy-king, and certainly never to sit in the chair behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.

20558,20558,Кто любит Стивена Сигала?,Жанна Ивченко,"Политика 
Помните первые видеосалоны 1990-х, с их атмосферой полузапретного плода и незабываемым насморочным голосом переводчика? Именно благодаря видеосалонам жители бывшего СССР впервые познакомились с творчеством Стивена Сигала. Пусть он немного уступал по популярности Шварценеггеру и Ван Дамму, но зато как дрались на экране его герои – мастер айкидо, отважный детектив, лихой корабельный кок и прочие супермены! Как восхищённо бились сердца мальчишек, мысленно ставивших себя на место актёра! Даже то, что в фильме “Мерцающий” главный герой, среди прочего, боролся с вездесущей русской мафией, не охлаждало воображения юных фанатов. 
А потом девяностые закончились, и с ними закончился и Сигал. То есть он и дальше снимал фильмы, и сам снимался, но кассовые сборы с каждым новым фильмом всё падали и падали. А расходы на них всё росли и росли: не успел актёр стать в первый раз дедом, как родился седьмой, последний его ребёнок. Пока последний. В такой ситуации – когда популярность ушла, а семья и расходы на неё велики – российские угасшие звезды начинают пресловутый “чёс по провинции”, не брезгуя ни домом культуры железнодорожников, ни детским санаторием “Солнышко”. Что же до звёзд зарубежных, то они начинают усиленно окучивать постсоветское пространство. 
Сигал, до того, как уже говорилось ранее, героически боровшийся с русской мафией на тогда ещё весьма широком экране, вдруг вспомнил о своих русских корнях. Воспоминание пришлось очень кстати: в России Сигала приняли настолько тепло, что его вояжи в страну быстро стали регулярными. Знакомства с известными политиками, вплоть до президента, толпы поклонников, внимание журналистов из серьёзных изданий – на Западе о таком Сигал и мечтать не мог, даже в лучшие годы. Быстро войдя в образ почётного гостя, Сигал попробовал себя и в роли политической фигуры, дав ценный совет президенту США — дружить с Россией. 
На днях заслуги Сигала в области единоборств, кино и политики были вознаграждены: указом президента он принят в гражданство РФ. Формальными основаниями, которые озвучил пресс-секретарь президента Д. Песков, стали не только “тёплые чувства” в адрес России, но и тот факт, что Сигал является достаточно известным актёром И напрасно скептики кривят губы: и то, и другое – правда. Вне сомнения, Сигалу искренне симпатична российская публика (а равно и сербская, и белорусская): ведь больше он никому уже не интересен. А что до известности, так ведь и элита, и значительная часть общества — родом из 90-х, а воспоминания детства и ранней юности – это свято и навсегда. Так что с нетерпением ждём присвоения российского гражданства Сталлоне, Ван Дамму, Дитеру Болену, Си Си Кетч и полному актёрскому составу сериала “Просто Мария”. С Депардье-то получилось!",1
20559,20559,"With Preet Bharara’s Dismissal, Storied Office Loses Its Top Fighter - The New York Times",Benjamin Weiser and William K. Rashbaum,"For more than seven years, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, made a name for himself as one of the nation’s most aggressive and outspoken prosecutors of public corruption and Wall Street crime. With Mr. Bharara, 48, being told on Friday to step down from his post, it was unclear what effect his expected departure might have on the office’s current investigations. In past presidential transitions, the storied office, long known to be so independent of Washington that some people referred to it as the Sovereign District of New York, has in large measure moved forward unaffected by politics. Under Mr. Bharara, the office prosecuted Democratic and Republican officials with equal ardor, most notably Sheldon Silver, the former Democratic speaker of New York’s Assembly, and Dean G. Skelos, the former Republican majority leader of the State Senate. His office is preparing to try a group of former aides and associates of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in a   bribery and   case and has been investigating Mayor Bill de Blasio’s campaign   as part of an inquiry into whether he or other officials exchanged official acts for political donations. The investigation into Mr. de Blasio’s   perhaps the office’s highest profile continuing inquiry, began roughly a year ago and appears to be in its final stages, with prosecutors and F. B. I. agents interviewing the mayor for four hours two weeks ago. The mayor’s press secretary said at the time that Mr. de Blasio was cooperating in the inquiry and that “at all times the mayor and his staff acted appropriately and well within the law. ” Investigators have scrutinized scores of donors to the mayor’s 2013 campaign and his now defunct political nonprofit, seeking to determine whether anyone received favorable city action in exchange for their largess. And with the mayor gearing up for his   campaign  —   he is now seeking to raise the bulk of his war chest from smaller donors  —   his lawyers are pressing prosecutors to conclude the investigation or, they say, risk affecting the election’s outcome. It remains unclear whether Mr. Bharara and his top aides have determined whether they will seek charges  —   against the mayor, any of his top aides or his primary  . Under Mr. Bharara’s stewardship, the office was also known for its insider trading investigations, civil rights cases and terrorism prosecutions. Another pending investigation appears to focus on how Fox News structured settlements of claims brought by network employees. Mr. Bharara would presumably be succeeded temporarily by his deputy, Joon H. Kim, a longtime prosecutor and former head of the office’s criminal division. Also on Friday, the United States attorney for New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, said in a statement that his resignation had been requested and in Brooklyn, Robert L. Capers, said he had been “instructed to resign. ” Mr. Bharara had not issued a statement as of Friday evening, when his office was uncertain whether the resignation request applied to him. The announcement that he had been told to resign along with 45 other United States attorneys around the country comes little more than three months after he met with Donald J. Trump, then   at Trump Tower, and announced afterward that Mr. Trump had asked him to stay on as the United States attorney. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mr. Bharara said that Mr. Trump had asked to see him to discuss “whether or not I’d be prepared to stay on as the United States attorney to do the work as we have done it, independently, without fear or favor for the last seven years. ” “We had a good meeting,” Mr. Bharara said. “I said I would absolutely consider staying on. I agreed to stay on. ” Mr. Bharara also said at the time that he had already spoken with   Jeff Sessions, the Republican of Alabama who Mr. Trump appointed attorney general. “He also asked that I stay on, and so I expect that I will be continuing,” Mr. Bharara said. Among the names of lawyers mentioned as a possible United States attorney in Manhattan in the Trump administration is Marc L. Mukasey, a former Southern District prosecutor and the son of Michael B. Mukasey, the former attorney general in the Bush administration. The younger Mr. Mukasey is now a lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, a law firm in New York where Rudolph W. Giuliani, a close associate of Mr. Trump, also works. Mr. Mukasey declined to comment on Friday. Mr. Bharara is no stranger to politics: before being appointed United States attorney by President Barack Obama in 2009, he served as chief counsel to Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and played a major role in the Senate Judiciary Committee’s investigation into the politically motivated firings of United States attorneys by the Justice Department under President George W. Bush. If there is a “credible whiff that justice has been politicized,” Mr. Bharara told The New York Times in 2014, “there’s nothing worse than that. ”",0

20561,20561,Virgil: Making America Great Again—Or Not: The Establishment Targets Trump’s Top Strategist,Virgil,"Part Three of a   series  …      In Part One we saw how the gospel of globalism inspires its believers to disdain, even despise,   nationalists —  that is, the people who voted for Donald Trump.  And in Part Two we saw how the Deep State, one of the many weapons in the globalist arsenal, is now targeting  Trump and his agenda for America.  Here in Part Three, we will focus on how one   Trump opponent is seeking to pick off a key member of the new presidential staff.  1. Fake News: “Bannon vs. Trump” Attacks on Stephen K. Bannon, the former executive chairman of Breitbart, slated to become the top strategist in the Trump White House, are nothing new.  Just since the election, Mother Jones magazine has called him “worse . . . than a racist,” Joy Behar labeled him “a fascist,” and former Vermont governor Howard Dean insisted, against all evidence, that he is “a Nazi. ”  You get the idea.   Okay, these   assaults haven’t gotten very far they were tried, too, during the 2016 campaign, and Bannon’s standing within Trump world has never wavered.  And yet, of course, the assaults keep coming.  And so to help keep track of them all, perhaps we should assign them into categories.  For example, in an earlier article, not part of this series, Virgil cited the ways in which “argument from authority” —  argumentum ad verecundiam —  can be used and, more often these days, misused.    So now we can add a second, slyer, category of media falsehood.  We can call this one the “assertion of a false conflict,” declaratio contra falsum.  This one is a version of the familiar attempt to stir the pot, whipping up hard feelings between people: Hey, did you hear what he said about you?  And here’s Brooks’ description of the gist of Bannon’s speech:  Humane capitalism has been replaced by the savage capitalism that brought us the financial crisis.  National democracy has been replaced by a   network of global elites.  Traditional virtue has been replaced by abortion and gay marriage.  Sovereign   are being replaced by hapless multilateral organizations like the E. U.  Decadent and enervated, the West lies vulnerable in the face of a confident and convicted Islamofascism, which is the cosmic threat of our time. So that’s how Brooks characterizes Bannon’s beliefs.  And Brooks is just warming up.  He then goes on to compare Trump to Vladimir Putin, and Bannon to a conservative Russian political figure in Putin’s orbit, Alexander Dugin.   Yet after making these dark comparisons, Brooks offers his readers a ray of light: The dark   he predicts, will fail.  Why? Because, Brooks chortles, Trump is such a lazy, egocentric, lightweight that he will lose interest in these Bannonite topics and so will drift over to the side of the globalists.   A question leaps immediately to mind: Did Brooks get some scoop as to Trump’s thinking?  Some revelatory interview? The answer, Brooks indicates, is “no. ”  It’s just his hunch:  I’m personally betting the foreign policy apparatus, including the secretaries of state and defense, will grind down the populists around Trump. David Brooks has enjoyed a good career in the MSM.  Born in 1961, he’s nominally a conservative, having worked variously at National Review, The Wall Street Journal, The Weekly Standard, and, since 2003, as a opinion columnist for The New York Times. And along the way, he has expressed some interesting ideas for example, in 2006, he opined that Sens. John McCain and Joe Lieberman should form their own third party, based mostly on their shared neoconservatism and globalism.  Needless to say, nothing ever came of Brooks’ suggestion.   Over his career, Brook has been notable for three things: first, a book published in 2000 that celebrated the   luxe lifestyle second, a fervent advocacy of the 2003 Iraq War and third, his journalstic love affair with Barack Obama. In other words, he’s the perfect sort of housebroken “conservative” for Washington, DC, just the sort of fellow who gets that   gig on the PBS NewsHour.  Okay, so let’s consider Brooks’ track record on Donald Trump.  We can sum it up with two points: First, he hates Trump and second, he is not a good forecaster. In March of last year, the headline of his column was “No, Not Trump, Not Ever. ”  In that piece he harumphed, “Donald Trump is epically unprepared to be president. He has no realistic policies, no advisers, no capacity to learn. ”  Then Brooks really got going: Trump is perhaps the most dishonest person to run for high office in our lifetimes.  All politicians stretch the truth, but Trump has a steady obliviousness to accuracy. And since Trump was so terrible in Brooks’ mind, it was hard for him to imagine that anyone else could like him.  Thus in June 2016, he predicted that in the November election to come, Hillary Clinton would beat Trump.  As he put it, “People will be sick of Donald Trump, and they will go for her. ”  To cap it off, in a column published on November 4, four days before the 2016 general election, Brooks doubled down on his endorsement of Clinton, describing her as “the bigger change agent. ”  Then he went on to describe Trump as “solipsistic, impatient, combative, unsubtle and ignorant,” all the while insisting that Clinton was “better suited to getting things done. ”  Amusingly, among the things Clinton would get done, Brooks told his readers, was developing a plan to “secure the border. ”  Perfectly expressing the Times’ view of the world, Brooks added, “Any sensible person can distinguish between an effective operating officer [Clinton] and a whirling disaster who is only about himself [Trump]. ” Okay, so Brooks, along with 99. 9 percent of the rest of the Times, liked Clinton and didn’t like Trump.  We get that.  Yet further details of that column are revealing —  revealing, that is, about Brooks.  Here’s how the piece starts: A few weeks ago I met a guy in Idaho who was absolutely certain that Donald Trump would win this election.  He was wearing tattered, soiled overalls, missing a bunch of teeth and was unnaturally skinny.  He was probably about 50, but his haggard face looked 70.  He was getting by aimlessly as a handyman. We might linger over some of those snobby word choices: “tattered, soiled overalls . . . missing a bunch of teeth. ” Virgil might pause to ask: Since the 1972 movie Deliverance, has has there ever been a more profoundly perfect stereotype of how a posh Easterner looks down his nose at the rubes in the rest of the country?   In the piece, Brooks, himself blissfully confident that Hillary was going to prevail, then goes on recount how he tried patiently to explain to the man that he was wrong in his thinking.  And yet, Brooks writes with a sigh, “It was like telling him a sea gull could play billiards. ”  One might think that the actual election results, four days later, would have humbled Brooks a bit, but they haven’t —  not at all.   Since the election, he’s been as strongly   as ever.  And, amazingly, he’s still in the game of making predictions for Times readers, “The guy will probably resign or be impeached within a year. ” As for Steve Bannon, he has views that can only be described as Trumpian, and he has held them for a long time.  So of course the globalists hate him, too. Since Bannon only rarely gives interviews, some might be curious to know more about his thinking —  that is, looking beyond the nasty canards hurled at him by the likes of Mother Jones, Behar, and Dean. In fact, Bannon has been articulating his vision for a long time since 2004, he has produced no fewer than 16 documentaries.   Yet a more direct and personal window into Bannon’s thinking can be found in his 2014 speech to the Vatican that’s the one that Brooks ripped in his January 10 column.  So, without Brooks’ “help,” let’s take a closer look: Bannon begins by saying that he believes, strongly, that there’s “a crisis” in our time —  that is, “a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism. ”  And so he begins with the spiritual question yes, many today are well off, but the question they should be asking themselves is deeper than money:  What is the purpose of whatever I’m doing with this wealth? What is the purpose of what I’m doing with the ability that God has given us, that divine providence has given us to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth? He continues in this vein: It really behooves all of us to really take a hard look and make sure that we are reinvesting that back into positive things. Yes, we should invest in positive things, things of faith and belief, which money can’t buy.  Thus the “crisis of faith. ”  So now we come to Bannon’s “crisis of the West. ”  Here, we need only look to Angela Merkel’s Germany it’s the richest country in Europe, and yet it is now in deadly danger of demographic dissolution —  and threatens to take the whole continent down with it.  Indeed, Bannon’s words from 2014, before Merkel foolishly chose to open her borders while subsidizing permanent dependence, now look prescient.  He warned then that the threat from jihadi Islam is “going to come to Europe . . . it’s going to come to the United Kingdom. ”  Moreover, in his talk he took note of a tweet that very day from ISIS, promising to turn the United States into a “river of blood. ” Yes, a crisis of the West, indeed.  Hawkins summarized Bannon’s Vatican speech, in which Bannon argued that in recent decades, capitalism seems to have come mostly in two forms, both at least somewhat pernicious: First, there’s the   “crony capitalism” that we saw in the scandalous 2008 bailouts and second, there’s the “Ayn Rand influenced . . . libertarian capitalism, which he sees as commoditizing people into mere producers and products. ”  This latter kind, Hawkins continued, weakens “our collective moral strength. ”   The answer, Hawkins concluded, is “enlightened capitalism” —  that is, the capitalism in which capitalists think about the fate of their country, not just their bank account.  As Hawkins put it: It was this enlightened capitalism that gave the   —  through wide asset ownership —    strong middle class and an aspirant and affluent working class which provided the moral and economic foundations for the West to defeat Nazism in 1945 and support Ronald Reagan in   to and defeating the Soviet Union during the Cold War.  And now this has been corrupted and in turn weakened the West itself and Bannon believes the West now faces losing everything it has gained across more than 2000 years. [emphasis added] Hawkins ended his essay with these hopeful words: With Bannon, Trump and “Trumpism” the US and the West has an opportunity for economic, moral and political renewal —  a new enlightenment.  Okay, so Hawkins ably describes the problem, and outlines the ultimate desired outcome.   And yet we might ask: How, exactly, does America get there?  How do we get from the crisis of 2017 to a better place —  as soon as possible?  For the answer, we might return to Bannon’s 2014 talk, in which he called for aggressively building “a   populist movement,” the heart of which should be: . . . the middle class, the working men and women in the world who are just tired of being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos. Interestingly, that seems to have happened in the last three years!  We can also pause to note that “Davos,” of course, is shorthand for the World Economic Forum, a conclave of billionaire globalists and their courtiers, meeting every year in Davos, Switzerland.  And so Bannon’s reference to “the party of Davos” speaks to the reality that global high finance seems to have conquered most of the politics, and most of the parties, of most of the world —  and as a result, the America middle class, now sinking in the globalist broth, has been made worse off.  It might be worth noting that the next Davos meeting is just a few days away, on January 17 to 20.  And since this is the first session since the November election, there’s going to be some   —  and a lot more attempted  .   And yet Davos Men, and Davos Women will not be giving up so easily.   For instance, one of the scheduled “chats” at Davos will be between Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Meg Whitman of HP together they will offer their   audience their   thoughts on shaping “a positive narrative for the global community. ”  That is, a “global community” that’s safely profitable for Facebook and HP, wherever in the world they might choose to operate.  Will these efforts at spinning globalism succeed?  Will the globalists be permitted to keep inflating their financial bubbles —  and keep getting bailed out when they pop?  The Davosians surely hope so, but it’s possible, after Trump (and before Trump, Brexit) that the jig is up.  But wait!  There’s still hope for the globalists.  The new American president might not think much of Davos, but the president of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping, thinks differently. Indeed, he is scheduled to speak at Davos in a few days it will the   appearance by a Chinese head of state.    We can assume, of course, that Xi, picking up the torch from, say, Barack Obama, will offer a   defense of globalism after all, globalism has been very, very good for his country.   4. Trump’s Moment, In the meantime, the eyes of the world are on the    45th president.  As noted in Part One, Trump’s energetic economic activism is already making itself felt: And the good news has continues to pour forth: Just on January 12, Amazon announced that it would commit to creating 100, 000 new jobs in the US.  Moreover, on January 13, Lockheed, which had earlier been chastised by Trump for   announced that it would pledge not only lower costs for its   fighter, but also an additional 1800 jobs in Texas.   As Virgil also noted earlier, it’s astonishing that past presidents didn’t engage in this sort of       economic patriotism perhaps they didn’t know how, or perhaps they didn’t care.   In any case, Trump does know how, and he does care.  And the American people are noticing.  According to a January 10 Quinnipiac Poll, 47 percent of Americans believe that Trump’s economic policies will help the economy, while only 31 percent say they will hurt.  In other words, Trump has already built for himself a   advantage on that question.  And his presidency has not yet even begun.  To be sure, in the next few years, Trump, and his team, will be tested again and again.  And while it’s impossible to predict the future, it would be foolish to bet against them. ",0
20562,20562,Trump: ’We Must Realize the Full Potential of Women in Our Economy’ - Breitbart,Trent Baker,"During Friday’s Weekly Address, President Donald Trump discussed the importance of women to the economy, saying he will deliver on his promise to help women in the workforce and ensuring they have “equal access to the capital, markets and networks of support that they need. ”  Transcript as follows: My fellow Americans, we have taken major steps during the first few weeks of my administration to remove wasteful regulations and get our people back to work. I’ve been saying I was going to do that for a long time. This week, I signed two pieces of legislation to remove burdens on our economy, continued to keep my promises to the American people, and so much more. I signed House Joint Resolution 38, which eliminates an   regulation put forward by unelected bureaucrats. Our coal miners have been treated horribly, and we are going to turn that around, and we’re gonna turn it around quickly. We are going to fight for lower energy prices for all Americans as part of the deal. That’s why I also signed a resolution to eliminate a costly regulation   imposed on American energy companies. By stopping this regulation, we were able to save American companies and workers millions and millions of dollars in   compliance costs. But to truly succeed as a country, we must realize the full potential of women in our economy. That is why I was thrilled to host the White House’s Women Business Leaders Roundtable. Very exciting. Great women. As president, I am committed to ensuring that women entrepreneurs have equal access to the capital, markets and networks of support that they need  —   and I mean really need. And it’s going to happen. This is a priority for my administration. I campaigned on helping women in the workforce and we are going to deliver on that promise, believe me. In fact, as part of my first official meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, this week we announced the creation of the Joint United   Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. Actually, very exciting. The United States also reaffirmed our unbreakable bond this week with our cherished ally Israel. It was an honor to welcome my friend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. I affirmed to the prime minister America’s commitment to working with Israel and our allies and partners toward greater security and stability. The threat of terrorism  —   and believe me it is a threat  —   must be confronted and defeated and we will defeat it. We share with Israel our deep conviction that we must protect all innocent human life. So as you head into Presidents’ Day weekend, the American people should know that we are working tirelessly on your behalf. We are not here for the benefit of bureaucrats, consultants or pundits. We are here to work for you and only for you, the American people. Thank you, God bless you and God bless America. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent",0
20563,20563,"Here’s Why Everyone on Facebook Is Checking into Standing Rock, North Dakota",Eddy Lavine,"posted by Eddie When it comes to brute force, law enforcement and private security currently have the upper hand on the ground in Standing Rock, North Dakota. They’re employing armored vehicles, riot gear, tasers, rubber bullets, pepper spray, sound cannons, and other shows of force against peaceful opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. But unlike most of the corporate media, the Internet is taking note of the struggle at Standing Rock and is trying to do its part to contribute to the protests. Over the weekend, unconfirmed reports emerged that police were using Facebook check-ins at Standing Rock to track individuals who arrived at the location to join water protectors. As word spread of the apparent news, the Internet stepped up to neutralize the power of the police-surveillance state. 

Shortly after, Facebook users from around the country and world began checking into Standing Rock, which registers as Cannon Ball, North Dakota, in an effort to confuse police. According to a statement many posters are copying and pasting: “ The Morton County Sheriff’s Department has been using Facebook check-ins to find out who is at Standing Rock in order to target them in attempts to disrupt the prayer camps. SO Water Protectors are calling on EVERYONE to check-in at Standing Rock, ND to overwhelm and confuse them. This is concrete action that can protect people putting their bodies and well-beings on the line that we can do without leaving our homes. “ Others merely checked in while still others added their own commentary. “ If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor ,” wrote Patrick Quinn below his check-in.

While the troll effort is exciting, it’s unclear whether the efforts are having an effect. According to Snopes, a self-described fact-checking blog whose conclusions are generally reliable , police claim they are not using Facebook to track protesters. Snopes reported “ [a Morton County] officer explained not only that they were not using Facebook check-ins as a gauge of anything, but that the metric presented no intelligence value to them. The rumor suggested that protesters cited Facebook check-ins as a manner in which police could target them, but check-ins were voluntary — and if police were using geolocation tools based on mobile devices, remote check-ins would not confuse or overwhelm them.” Snopes also claimed it spoke to protesters within a large camp at Standing Rock who said they did not issue a call to Internet users to check in. Nevertheless, they reportedly said they appreciated the show of solidarity. Regardless of whether or not the online check-ins have any effect, the Internet has played a decisive role in the developing events in North Dakota. Livestreams have documented serious violations of free speech and the right to protest, and Facebook was accused of blocking such footage on at least one occasion. Amid the ongoing lack of mainstream coverage , the independent media has successfully drawn attention to the Standing Rock protests. Considering the establishment has come out in full force in North Dakota, from their use of surveillance to their haphazard employment of heavily armed police, the increasing number of check-ins at Standing Rock shows just how much technology empowers people. Even if police aren’t scouring social media and the check-ins fail to produce any tangible result, the rapid mobilization of efforts highlights a growing sense of opposition to unjust and exploitative power — and thanks to the Internet, the world is watching. source:",1
20564,20564,"Men Have Book Clubs, Too - The New York Times",Jennifer Miller,"None of the men in the Man Book Club had a problem with the   scene in “The Power of the Dog,” a 1967 novel by Thomas Savage. But more than one member of this   reading group in Marin County, Calif. got squeamish when the host announced that the taco appetizers he had prepared that night were filled with   Rocky Mountain oysters  —   that is, animal testicles. “The fun part was looking at the expressions,” said the club’s founder, Andrew McCullough, 53. “Some guys had real difficulty swallowing. I kept eating. I have standards I need to adhere to, as secretary and founder. ” The Man Book Club is going into its ninth year. It has 16 members, a number of whom are lawyers and engineers in their  . Each month, the host must prepare a meal appropriate to the book under discussion. There was an   French supper to accompany Henry Miller’s “Tropic of Cancer” and a meal of refined comfort food presented on TV trays for Bill Bryson’s   memoir, “The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid. ” “I was always a little jealous of my wife’s book clubs,” Mr. McCullough said. “Now our wives are jealous of us. We’ve created something that is more durable. The book club my wife belongs to  —   there’s a lot of changeover. ” Women, it seems, can afford to drop in and out of reading groups. In its 2011 survey of voluntary organizations, the Pew Research Center found that 11 percent of Americans were active in “literary, discussion or study groups such as book clubs” and that women were more than twice as likely to take part in such gatherings as men were. Perhaps because participation in reading groups is perceived as a female activity, some   book clubs have an outsize need to proclaim the endeavor’s masculinity. In addition to going by the name the Man Book Club, for instance, Mr. McCullough’s group expresses its notion of manliness through the works it chooses to read. “We do not read   chick lit,” he said. “The main character cannot be a woman. ” This is detailed in the Man Book Club’s criteria, on the group’s website: “No books by women about women (our cardinal rule)”. The members of the club rate books on a scale of 1 to 10. The leader, with a score of 8. 8, is “Nobody’s Fool” by Richard Russo the   book, at 3. 3, is “Oscar and Lucinda” by Peter Carey. Another   reading group, this one with a name even more insistently macho than that of the Man Book Club, is the International Ultra Manly Book Club, of Kansas City, Kan. It was started by a group of college friends, and its website hammers home its   identity through prominent images of Chuck Norris, Dwayne Johnson (better known as the Rock) and Oprah Winfrey, standing before an Oprah’s Book Club logo beneath the legend “Not Your Mother’s Book Club. ” Unlike the Marin County group, the International Ultra Manly Book Club is not big on the   element. When one of its members does bring food to one of the monthly   it tends to be “manly  —   like, spicy,” said John Creagar, 32, one of the regulars. In explaining the club’s purpose, the International Ultra Manly Book Club website makes explicit the notion that men take literature as seriously as women. The “About Us” section says it was founded, in part, on the vision that “one day we could step out of the shadow of our mothers’ book clubs and proclaim that yes, we too, are intellectuals. ” If that mission statement seems a tad defensive, there are indeed women who treat book clubs as entities that lie beyond the masculine sphere. Two years ago, Edward Nawotka, 44, a writer and editor in Houston, was out for drinks with the guys from his reading group, the Houston Men’s Book Club, when a woman started hitting on its president. “She asked how we knew each other, and when we said, ‘book club,’ she was like, ‘Wait, are you gay? ’” Mr. Nawotka said. (He added that he and the woman ended up dating.) He said he understood her reaction. “Fiction is designed to examine empathy,” Mr. Nawotka said. “Men aren’t encouraged to talk about their feelings or emotions in public. When your friend gets divorced, you don’t sit around with the guys wondering, ‘How do you think Jon feels about getting divorced? ’” But over discussions of José Saramago, Haruki Murakami and Anthony Doerr, the 15 members of his group have formed a bond. “We’ve seen each other through family tragedies,” Mr. Nawotka said. “When I needed a divorce attorney, I turned to these guys. ” And when the founding member’s wife died from cancer, all the club members attended the funeral. Jon Tomlinson is the founder of the NYC Gay Guys’ Book Club, which meets at the Jefferson Market Library in New York City and has 1, 200 members in its Meetup. com group. Anywhere from 10 to 60 men show up at the monthly meetings. “People come to connect, to find their place in a new city, to fall in love,” Mr. Tomlinson said. Especially popular NYC Gay Guys’ Book Club novels have included “Giovanni’s Room” by James Baldwin, “A Single Man” by Christopher Isherwood and “The Goldfinch” by Donna Tartt, Mr. Tomlinson said. The selection process, he added, is largely democratic, but at times he feels obligated to vet suggestions. “Some guy wanted to read a   book on lesbians who were persecuted in Russia,” he said. “I’m not going to get people to read that book. ” For the International Ultra Manly Book Club, in Kansas City, the monthly meetings provide a space to explore literary depictions of what it means to be a man. The regulars have considered the issue while discussing everything from “Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter” by Seth   to “Rabbit, Run” by John Updike. “Manliness means something different for all of us,” Mr. Creagar said. But all the members share a love of books. “There’s this idea that if guys read, we don’t think that deeply about it,” Mr. Creagar said. The club rates the books it reads on a   system for overall quality, and on a    system for “manliness. ” “Gilead,” by Marilynne Robinson, for instance, earned four and a half stars and three hand grenades. Mr. Creagar suspects there are many male readers who would love to join a book club. “But they don’t get asked,” he said, “or they worry that, if they do join, they’ll be seen as intruding on a female activity or stigmatized as being the only guy. ” For this reason, the International Ultra Manly Book Club sees itself as a resource for men seeking a literary community. In addition to listing its reading schedule, its site includes “best of” lists, including the “Top 100 Books for Every Man. ” Though it includes rough stuff like “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” by Hunter Thompson and “Blood Meridian” by Cormac McCarthy, the list has room for gentler works, like “The Chronicles of Narnia” by C. S. Lewis and the Harry Potter series. And yet the group has standards. “We are not allowed to suggest books that our mothers have suggested,” Mr. Creagar said. “We had an accident one time. We read ‘Water for Elephants.’ It was a huge mistake. ”",0
20565,20565,"‘All Talk,’ ‘No Action,’ Says Trump in Twitter Attack on Civil Rights Icon - The New York Times",Mark Landler,"WASHINGTON  —   On Friday, Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, declared that he did not view Donald J. Trump as a “legitimate president. ” Mr. Lewis, an icon of the civil rights movement, said he planned to boycott the inauguration, the first he will skip in three decades. On Saturday, Mr. Trump hit back. “Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results,” Mr. Trump said in a pair of early morning Twitter posts. “All talk, talk, talk  —   no action or results,” he added. “Sad!” While some questioned Mr. Lewis’s assertion, many others expressed indignation about Mr. Trump’s outburst, pointing out the unseemliness of attacking a civil rights leader on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Mr. Lewis was one of the original Freedom Riders, beaten by police officers while marching from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama. Others ridiculed Mr. Trump’s characterization of Mr. Lewis’s district, which is majority   and encompasses   of Atlanta, as “horrible,” “falling apart” and “crime infested. ” In fact, Georgia’s Fifth Congressional District includes parts of wealthy areas like Buckhead the world’s busiest airport,   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Some pointed out that fighting with Mr. Lewis distracted attention from a Senate investigation, announced the day before, that will look at possible contacts between Mr. Trump’s campaign team and Russia. In addition, Mr. Trump’s poll numbers have slipped into uncharted depths for an incoming president, with a Gallup poll released on Friday finding that about half of Americans disapprove of Mr. Trump’s transition effort. Mr. Trump’s feud with Mr. Lewis carried echoes of his attacks on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the   parents of an American soldier killed in Iraq, after Mr. Khan spoke out against Mr. Trump at the Democratic National Convention. Those attacks were widely viewed to have backfired, and Mr. Trump later modulated his words about the Khans. Mr. Trump himself has experience questioning a president’s legitimacy. He was instrumental in sowing doubts about President Obama’s birthplace. Mr. Lewis, who is 76 and was first elected to Congress in 1987, is one of the few genuinely historic figures on Capitol Hill, revered by Democrats and Republicans alike. Allies of Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, circulated pictures of him linking arms with Mr. Lewis at the 50th anniversary of the Selma march to fend off accusations that Mr. Sessions was a racist. Nevertheless, Mr. Lewis testified against Mr. Sessions, declaring, “We need someone as attorney general who’s going to look out for all of us, and not just some of us. ” A few critics, including David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said they disagreed with Mr. Lewis’s statement that Mr. Trump was not legitimate, which he made in an interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News and which will be broadcast on “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Still, Mr. Axelrod said of Mr. Lewis: “I honor the man he is. Honesty integrity courage  —   these are qualities you can’t buy. ” In his interview with Mr. Todd, Mr. Lewis said he believed that the Russians had delivered the election to Mr. Trump. “You know, I believe in forgiveness,” he said. “I believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It’s going to be very difficult. I don’t see this   as a legitimate president. ” Mr. Lewis is one of a handful of Democratic members of Congress who have announced that they will boycott the inauguration on Friday. Others include Barbara Lee of California, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Luis Gutiérrez of Illinois.",0
20566,20566,Trump will win November 8 election: American professor,nan,"Politics US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump gestures while speaking to a crowd of donors at the McGlohon Theater in Charlotte, North Carolina, on October 26, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will win the November 8 election, says an American professor who has correctly predicted almost every presidential election in the United States. 
Professor Helmut Norpoth, of New York’s SUNY Stony Brook University, said his model shows Trump performed comparatively better in the primaries so he will triumph next month, The Independent reported on Thursday. 
Norpoth developed a model which, when applied retroactively, successfully predicted every presidential election in the United States since 1912 all but one, which was the 2000 election, when it said Democratic nominee Al Gore would beat Republican candidate George W. Bush. But instead Bush won the election. 
Al Gore won the popular vote, but Bush was awarded more votes in the Electoral College following a disputed result in Florida. So Bush was declared winner. 
The political scientist’s model suggests that the person who emerges as the strongest candidate in the primaries will go on to win the presidency. 
“I think he was the strongest candidate in the primaries and that he will prevail,” Professor Norpoth told the New York Post . 
“The model predicted a Trump win in February and nothing has changed since then. Whatever happens in the real world doesn’t affect the model,” he stated. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Professor of Political Science at Stony Brook Helmut Norpoth, New York 
Recent polls show that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton Clinton’s national lead over Trump is shrinking as Election Day is approaching. 
The former secretary of state has the support of 49 percent of likely voters, while the billionaire businessman has 44 percent support, according to the CNN/ORC survey released on Monday. 
In addition, preliminary figures suggest the US presidential race remains tight in so-called swing states, despite boasting by Clinton’s campaign that she is far ahead. 
Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has an edge in several of the roughly 10 swing states that will decide the 2016 White House race. 
Trump has also potential advantages of his own in some battleground states.

20567,20567,Will Trump Resist War Hawks on Iran?,Consortiumnews.com,"Will Trump Resist War Hawks on Iran? November 15, 2016 
Though President-elect Trump seems ready to reduce tensions with Russia, his consideration of neocon John Bolton as Secretary of State could presage more Mideast warmongering toward Iran, writes Gareth Porter at Middle East Eye. 
By Gareth Porter 
Post-election comments on Middle East policy last week by President-elect Donald Trump and one his campaign advisers have provoked speculation about whether Trump will upend two main foreign policy lines of the Obama administration in the Middle East. 
But the more decisive question about the future of U.S. policy toward the region is whom Trump will pick for his national security team – and especially whether he will nominate John Bolton to become Secretary of State. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. 
Bolton, one of the most notorious members of Dick Cheney’s team plotting wars in the George W. Bush administration, would certainly push for the effective nullification of the main political barrier to U.S. confrontation with Iran: the 2015 multilateral nuclear deal. 
Trump created a minor stir by giving an interview to the Wall Street Journal last Thursday in which he reiterated his criticism of the Obama administration’s involvement in the war against Syria’s Assad and supported cooperation with Russia against the Islamic State group. And a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser once connected with an extremist sectarian Christian militia in Lebanon named Walid Phares suggested in an interview with BBC radio that Trump would demand that Iran “change [a] few issues” in the agreement and that “the agreement as it is right now … is not going to be accepted by a Trump administration”. 
The significance of that interview, however, is very unclear. Trump himself had avoided threatening such a move during the campaign, denouncing the nuclear agreement as “disastrous” but avoiding any pledge to renounce it as his Republican rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio had done. In his speech to AIPAC, Trump thundered against the agreement but promised only to enforce it strictly and hold Iran “accountable.” 
Trump has consistently embraced the long-standing official U.S. animosity toward Iran, but thus far he has given no indication that he intends to provoke an unnecessary crisis with Iran. 
In any case, Trump’s own views will only be the starting point for policymaking on Syria and Iran. His national security team will have the power to initiate policy proposals as well as effective veto power over Trump’s foreign policy preferences. That is why Trump’s choices of nominations for the top positions on national security will certainly be the crucial factor in determining what policy lines ultimately emerge on those issues – and why the real possibility of Bolton’s nomination as Secretary of State now represents the greatest threat to international peace and security. 
Undermining Obama 
Barack Obama became president with a firm intention to get U.S. combat forces out of Iraq within 16 months as he had promised during the campaign. But in his very first meeting with CENTCOM Commander Gen. David Petraeus, Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen in late January 2009, Petraeus and his two allies pressed Obama to back down on his pledge, arguing that it wasn’t realistic. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on May 1, 2011, watching developments in the Special Forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Neither played a particularly prominent role in the operation. (White House photo by Pete Souza) 
In the end, Obama accepted a scheme devised by the military and Pentagon officials under which combat brigades remained in Iraq long after the August 2010 Obama deadline for their withdrawal with no reduction in combat capability. They were simply given additional tasks of advising and assisting Iraqi military units and renamed “advisory and assistance brigades.” 
Later in 2009, Obama’s national security team, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, pushed for a major U.S. military escalation in Afghanistan in 2009-2010. Obama didn’t buy the arguments by Petraeus, Gates and Mullen for a huge increase in U.S. troops in Afghanistan. He and Vice-President Joe Biden argued that the implosion of Pakistan was a much bigger problem than Afghanistan and that there was no evidence of a threat that Al Qaeda would return to Afghanistan. But the war coalition leaked a story to the press that the White House was ignoring a new intelligence assessment that the Afghan Taliban would invite Al Qaeda back into the country if they won the war. 
In fact, the intelligence community had produced no such assessment, but the proponents of a big counterinsurgency effort in Afghanistan were demonstrating their power to use the media to raise the political cost to Obama of resisting their demand. Obama gave in on the additional troops, again imposing a deadline for their withdrawal, and the U.S. is still engaged in a losing war in Afghanistan seven years later. 
Those largely unknown episodes underline just how vulnerable Donald Trump will be as president to pressures from his national security team to support policies with which he may disagree – unless he chooses people who agree with his policy preferences. But Trump has a peculiar problem in that regard. Because he has already alienated virtually the entire Republican Party national security elite by attacking sacred cows such as NATO, and he has been boycotted by the corps of senior officials from the George W. Bush administration – except for Bolton. 
War with Iran 
Although he is best known as U.S. Ambassador the United Nations in the George. W. Bush administration, it was in his previous role as Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security from 2001 through 2004 that he played his most important role in U.S. foreign policy.

Although the story was never covered in the corporate news media, I have recounted in my history of the Iran nuclear issue how Bolton, with the full approval of Vice President Dick Cheney and in coordination with Israel, began in 2003 to implement a strategy aimed ultimately at maneuvering the U.S. into a military confrontation with Iran. The strategy relied on the accusation that the Islamic Republic was carrying out a covert nuclear weapons program. 
Bolton and Cheney failed to get their war with Iran, and Bolton was moved to the United Nations in the second Bush term. But Bolton has never stopped talking about the need for the United States to bomb Iran. 
In a New York Post op-ed on Nov. 14, he called on Trump to “abrogate” the nuclear agreement on his first day in office. He wants to be Secretary of State in order to pursue just such a policy, and he is under serious consideration, according to news reports last week. If he were nominated as Secretary of State it would be an open invitation for more plotting of schemes within the Trump administration for the war against Iran that Bolton still craves. 
Bolton would not necessarily prevail in pushing for a direct military confrontation with Iran over the nuclear issue, because the U.S. military would probably exercise its veto over any policy that risks war with Iran. But he could nevertheless provoke a crisis with Iran by subverting the agreement itself. He would begin by trying to get Trump to stop using his presidential waiver power to carry out its provisions on lifting sanctions against Iran. 
Under normal circumstances, Bolton would never have a chance to reprise his role as war provocateur, but the political circumstances today are anything but normal. There is a very real danger that the Trump transition team will turn to him because it sees no alternative among the usual suspects. 
The only alternative is to turn to a seasoned diplomat who has not served in senior national security positions in a Republican administration. And if the choices for other top positions are not determined to avoid the kind of confrontation that Bolton would try to provoke, he could conceivably succeed. 
So the disintegration of the political order controlled by the old Democratic and Republican party elites could spawn new threats of war unless Trump and his advisers are clever enough to see the need to avoid them in their choices of national security officials in the coming days.

Election eve, one finds the nation itself to be more pathetically unaware than the leading candidates are evil (morally reprehensible, arising from actual or imputed bad character or conduct), although the margin of difference is negligible. The crowds gathered to hear Clinton and Trump, t-shirts and hoodies decorated with campaign slogans, are two sides of the same mindless fascistic adoration of power, righteousness, indignation, a voluntary submission betraying the same ideological convictions of American exceptionalism and psychodynamics of gut hatred for and fear of difference from themselves and image of ethnocentric superiority. 
Study the faces as the news cameras pan the waiting lines or audiences, smugness, occasional contorted features, feigned innocence disguising certitude. The emptiness of the American public, obediently laying down before billionaire wealth and militaristic narcissism (here self-love engendered through capitalism and assisted by compulsive attachment to the hegemonic purposes of the State). Each side, contemptuous of the other, in reality, brothers/sisters-in-arms, raises to leadership the perfect expression of their own, and hence similar if not identical, needs for recognition to cover their inner nakedness of spirit and purpose. 
Trump, a bottomless pit of mammon-worship, Clinton, a sinkhole of war and aggression, express the fusion of capitalism and militarism, each in America vital to the presence and fruition of the other, that typifies the national mission of unilateral global domination. It was not always thus, although historical-institutional development pointed the direction for at least a century, when America outstripped its earlier foundations, the normalization of advanced industrial capitalism, to claim world moral-political pre-eminence based on spurious privileged association with God in carrying out His/Her divine mission of promised economic salvation. 
The formula has been a surefire winner because scrupulously backed by the real or implied threat (and use) of force, a silent militarism when not engaged in war to announce global financial-and-market penetration presumed to be uncontested (or when contested, the mark of the adversary). Exceptionalism is the ideological battering ram to knock down all opposition, and for those standing in line for the political bread-and-circuses of the two major parties, a validation of their distorted hatreds brought on by their own subordination in the great chain of capitalist being. 
If deep-down, though not consciously admitted, there is recognition of systemic rottenness in misshaping their yearnings and thwarting their present wellbeing and future prospects, this throws them, again both sides of the supposed political divide, into the arms of the Leadership Structure not unlike the authoritarian submission characterizing fascism in the transition from Weimar to Nazi Germany. (To be still in the transition phase and not to have as yet crossed the line, holds little promise of reversion to democratic government; too much has happened to suggest drawing back from the brink.) Collective ego-loss, seen in the faces of the ecstatic political faithful, the now-worshippers of power, goes a long way to explaining the candidates and their visions on offer. 
A closed system awaits the body politic. There is little room for turning left or right, when the center subsumes an already hard-bitten right and the near-ejection of the left from the political spectrum. The vanished center, however fictitious, is kept alive for purposes of self-deception and authoritative indoctrination, a useful cloak for democratic pretentions, as meanwhile the society is placed, willingly so, on a permanent footing of structural hierarchy at home, incessant intervention abroad. The interests of capitalism must be guarded (and celebrated) at all times, lest an alternative way of life become visible, founded on humane standards of international peace and societal betterment. To break out of the present imprisonment in invidious class debasement, is more painful, given long-term ideological habituation, than risking a future of freedom (of system, of conscience, of social solidarity). 
Thus, only days remain in the exercise of meaningless choice. After that, one can expect few impedances to the downward cast of policy, with increasing risks of war, class division, false consciousness to grease the rails of additional discontents as context for resentments and hatreds poisoning the atmosphere. More environmental spoliation, more gun violence, as tokens of the wayward path to fascism.",1

20572,20572,Comment on Due Process is Dead: A Staggering 95% of All Inmates in America Have Never Received a Trial by Raymond Karczewski,Raymond Karczewski,"Home / Be The Change / Government Corruption / Due Process is Dead: A Staggering 95% of All Inmates in America Have Never Received a Trial Due Process is Dead: A Staggering 95% of All Inmates in America Have Never Received a Trial Claire Bernish January 25, 2016 268 Comments 
In the Land of the Free, one-quarter of the entire planet’s prison population, some 2.2 million people, currently languish behind bars; yet, an astonishing number of them — around 2 million — have never been to trial . Indeed, these figures categorically debunk the notion the criminal justice system in the United States maintains any semblance of its formation’s original intent: to ensure the guilty suffer punishment befitting their crimes, while the innocent avoid false conviction. 
As the fundamental basis for the justice system in the United States, the Sixth Amendment states: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.” 
Justice, as an untold — though no doubt, appalling — number can attest, has been utterly abandoned for the interests of the careless expedience , apathetic convenience, and unabashed profiteering of the U.S. prison-industrial machine. 
“The reality is that almost no one who is imprisoned in America has gotten a trial,” explains award-winning journalist, Chris Hedges, in a recent Truthdig column . “There is rarely an impartial investigation. A staggering 97 percent of all federal cases and 95 percent of all state felony cases are resolved through plea bargaining.” Of those millions who bargained away their right to a trial by accepting plea deals, “significant percentages of them are innocent.” 
Plea bargaining failed in its attempt to facilitate pragmatic justice seen in earlier courts, before the advent of the “adversary system and the related development of the law of evidence,” as John H. Langein once described . After the Civil War, as Judge Jed S. Rakoff explained in the New York Review of Books , rising crime and immigration rates began to burden the system and plea bargains offered an acceptable solution. In other words, court proceedings were at one time swift and simple, and though such expediency might have seemed a desirable quality in the past, the incontrovertible reality at present is a system wholly focused on speed at the expense of the necessary — in fact, imperative — assumption of innocence of the accused. 
Indeed, for incontrovertible proof the court system no longer functions for the people — neither in its capacity to protect the public from the actual criminals, nor in its ostensible assurances no innocent person will be punished unfairly — take even a cursory glance at the trial system. Plea bargains have actualized a replacement of justice with a farcical, well-oiled machine of incarceration. “In actuality,” as Rakoff described, “our criminal justice system is almost exclusively a system of plea bargaining, negotiated behind closed doors and with no judicial oversight. The outcome is very largely determined by the prosecutor alone.” 
Of all federal criminal cases, “fewer than 3 percent went to trial. The plea bargains largely determined the sentences imposed.” 
Plea deals are presented to defendants as a way to escape the near certainty of a heavy-handed sentence should they be found guilty by a jury at trial — because defense attorneys’ and prosecutors’ most pressing goal is to prevent a trial in the first place. “Once you are charged in America,” Hedges said, “whether you did the crime or not, you are almost always found guilty.” 
In part, such ‘unconditional guilt’ begat the need for The Innocence Project — “a national litigation and public policy organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals through DNA testing and reforming the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice.” Since 1989, there have been 337 DNA-related exonerations with individuals having served a combined total of around 4,606 unjustified years — an average of 14 years, each, before being freed. Of those 337 cases, 31 individuals , who had served over 150 combined years, “pled guilty to crimes they didn’t commit — usually seeking to avoid the potential for a long sentence (or a death sentence),” states The Innocence Project’s website. 
“If all of the accused went to trial, the judicial system, which is designed around plea agreements, would collapse. And this is why trial sentences are horrific. It is why public attorneys routinely urge their clients to accept a plea arrangement. Trials are a flashing red light to the accused: DO NOT DO THIS. It is the inversion of justice. ” Of the students he teaches in prison, those “who have the longest sentences are usually the ones who demanded a trial.” 
While the rich and powerful, especially those associated with corporations and banks , are able to escape significant punishment — even when their crimes affect millions of people, such as those complicit in the 2008 financial crash — the poor, whether guilty or not, fall victim to this slanted system. As Hedges summarized: 
“If you are poor, you will be railroaded in an assembly-line production, from a town or city where there are no jobs, through the police stations, county jails and courts directly into prison. And if you are poor, because you don’t have any money for adequate legal defense, you will serve sentences that are decades longer than those for equivalent crimes anywhere else in the industrialized world … Being poor has become a crime. And this makes mass incarceration the most pressing civil rights issue of our era.” Share",1

Proposed pipeline routes through the Middle East to gas markets in Europe. The purple line is the Western-supported Qatar-Turkey pipeline. All of the nations it passes through — Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey (all highlighted in red) — have agreed to it … except Syria. The red line is the “Islamic Pipeline” from Iran through Iraq into Syria. See text below for further explanation. (Source: MintPress News ; click to enlarge) 
Summary first: We have been at war in Syria over pipelines since 1949. This is just the next mad phase. 
I’m not sure most Americans have figured out what’s happening in Syria, because so much of what we hear is confusing to us, and really, we know so little of the context for it. Is it an insurgency against a brutal ruler? Is it a group of insurgencies struggling for power in a nearly failed state? Is it a proxy war expressing the territorial and ideological interests of the U.S., Russia, Turkey and Iran? 
Or something else? 
According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. it is something else — a war between competing national interests to build, or not build, a pipeline to the Mediterranean so natural gas can be exported to Europe. Inconveniently for Syria, that nation lies along an obvious pipeline route. 
Which makes it another war between interests for money — something not very hard to understand at all. 
Here’s Kennedy’s argument via EcoWatch. This is a long piece, well worth a full read, but I’ll try to present just the relevant sections here. 
The Historical Context: Decades of CIA-Sponsored Coups and Counter-Coups in Syria 
Kennedy’s introductory section contains an excellent examination of the history of U.S. involvement in Syria starting in the 1950s with the Cold War machinations of the Eisenhower-appointed Dulles brothers, John Foster Dulles, the Secretary of State, and Allen Dulles, the head of the CIA. Together, they effectively ruled U.S. foreign policy. 
Kennedy writes (my emphasis): 
Syria: Another Pipeline War 
… America’s unsavory record of violent interventions in Syria—obscure to the American people yet well known to Syrians —sowed fertile ground for the violent Islamic Jihadism that now complicates any effective response by our government to address the challenge of ISIS. So long as the American public and policymakers are unaware of this past, further interventions are likely to only compound the crisis. Moreover, our enemies delight in our ignorance. 
… [W]e need to look at history from the Syrians’ perspective and particularly the seeds of the current conflict. Long before our 2003 occupation of Iraq triggered the Sunni uprising that has now morphed into the Islamic State, the CIA had nurtured violent Jihadism as a Cold War weapon and freighted U.S./Syrian relationships with toxic baggage. 
During the 1950’s, President Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers rebuffed Soviet treaty proposals to leave the Middle East a cold war neutral zone and let Arabs rule Arabia. Instead, they mounted a clandestine war against Arab Nationalism—which CIA Director Allan [sic] Dulles equated with communism—particularly when Arab self-rule threatened oil concessions. They pumped secret American military aid to tyrants in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon favoring puppets with conservative Jihadist ideologies which they regarded as a reliable antidote to Soviet Marxism. At a White House meeting between the CIA’s Director of Plans, Frank Wisner, and Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, in September of 1957, Eisenhower advised the agency, “We should do everything possible to stress the ‘holy war’ aspect.” 
The CIA began its active meddling in Syria in 1949 —barely a year after the agency’s creation. Syrian patriots had declared war on the Nazis, expelled their Vichy French colonial rulers and crafted a fragile secularist democracy based on the American model. But in March of 1949, Syria’s democratically elected president, Shukri-al-Kuwaiti, hesitated to approve the Trans Arabian Pipeline, an American project intended to connect the oil fields of Saudi Arabia to the ports of Lebanon via Syria. In his book, Legacy of Ashes , CIA historian Tim Weiner recounts that in retaliation, the CIA engineered a coup , replacing al-Kuwaiti with the CIA’s handpicked dictator , a convicted swindler named Husni al-Za’im. Al-Za’im barely had time to dissolve parliament and approve the American pipeline before his countrymen deposed him , 14 weeks into his regime. 
Kennedy then details the history of coups and counter-coups in and against Syria, and concludes this section with this: 
Thanks in large part to Allan Dulles and the CIA, whose foreign policy intrigues were often directly at odds with the stated policies of our nation, the idealistic path outlined in the Atlantic Charter was the road not taken. In 1957, my grandfather, Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, sat on a secret committee charged with investigating CIA’s clandestine mischief in the Mid-East . The so called “Bruce Lovett Report,” to which he was a signatory, described CIA coup plots in Jordan, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Egypt, all common knowledge on the Arab street, but virtually unknown to the American people who believed, at face value, their government’s denials. 
The report blamed the CIA for the rampant anti-Americanism that was then mysteriously taking root “in the many countries in the world today.”… A parade of Iranian and Syrian dictators, including Bashar al-Assad and his father , have invoked the history of the CIA’s bloody coups as a pretext for their authoritarian rule, repressive tactics and their need for a strong Russian alliance. These stories are therefore well known to the people of Syria and Iran who naturally interpret talk of U.S. intervention in the context of that history. 
While the compliant American press parrots the narrative that our military support for the Syrian insurgency is purely humanitarian, many Syrians see the present crisis as just another proxy war over pipelines and geopolitics. Before rushing deeper into the conflagration, it would be wise for us to consider the abundant facts supporting that perspective. 
So much for our supposed interest in “humanitarian” intervention in Syria. From a Syrian point of view, it has never been thus. It has been about pipelines since 1949, and they understand that, even if we don’t. 
The Current Conflagration 
Kennedy then turns to the present, or the near-present. Refer to the map above as you read: 
A Pipeline War 
In [the Syrians’] view, our war against Bashar Assad did not begin with the peaceful civil protests of the Arab Spring in 2011. Instead it began in 2000 when Qatar proposed to construct a $10 billion, 1,500km pipeline through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey . 
Qatar shares with Iran, the South Pars/North Dome gas field, the world’s richest natural gas repository. The international trade embargo, until recently, prohibited Iran from selling gas abroad and ensured that Qatar’s gas could only reach European markets if it is liquefied and shipped by sea, a route that restricts volume and dramatically raises costs. 
The EU, which gets 30 percent of its gas from Russia, was equally hungry for the pipeline which would have given its members cheap energy and relief from Vladimir Putin’s stifling economic and political leverage. Turkey, Russia’s second largest gas customer, was particularly anxious to end its reliance on its ancient rival and to position itself as the lucrative transect hub for Asian fuels to EU markets. The Qatari pipeline would have benefited Saudi Arabia’s conservative Sunni Monarchy by giving them a foothold in Shia dominated Syria. 
The Saudi’s geopolitical goal is to contain the economic and political power of the Kingdom’s principal rival, Iran , a Shiite state, and close ally of Bashar Assad. The Saudi monarchy viewed the U.S. sponsored Shia takeover in Iraq as a demotion to its regional power and was already engaged in a proxy war against Tehran in Yemen, highlighted by the Saudi genocide against the Iranian backed Houthi tribe. 
Which puts the Qatari pipeline squarely opposite to Russia’s national interest — natural gas (methane) sales to Europe. 
Of course, the Russians, who sell 70 percent of their gas exports to Europe, viewed the Qatar/Turkey pipeline as an existential threat. In Putin’s view, the Qatar pipeline is a NATO plot to change the status quo, deprive Russia of its only foothold in the Middle East, strangle the Russian economy and end Russian leverage in the European energy market. In 2009, Assad announced that he would refuse to sign the agreement to allow the pipeline to run through Syria “to protect the interests of our Russian ally.” 
That was likely the last straw vis-à-vis the U.S. Which brings us to another pipeline, the so-called “Islamic Pipeline” (see map above): 
“Assad further enraged the Gulf’s Sunni monarchs by endorsing a Russian approved “Islamic pipeline” running from Iran’s side of the gas field through Syria and to the ports of Lebanon. The Islamic pipeline would make Shia Iran instead of Sunni Qatar, the principal supplier to the European energy market and dramatically increase Tehran’s influence in the Mid-East and the world. Israel also was understandably determined to derail the Islamic pipeline which would enrich Iran and Syria and presumably strengthen their proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas. 
Another, competing pipeline which would run through Syrian territory, but this time carrying Iranian gas instead of Qatari gas. Thus the demonizing of Assad as evil in the mold of Saddam Hussein, instead of just a run-of-the-mill Middle East autocrat, as bad as some but better than others. Kennedy includes a good section on the history of the al-Assad family’s rule of Syria, including this information from top reporters Sy Hersh and Robert Parry: 
According to Hersh, “He certainly wasn’t beheading people every Wednesday like the Saudis do in Mecca.” Another veteran journalist, Bob Parry, echoes that assessment. “No one in the region has clean hands but in the realms of torture, mass killings, civil liberties and supporting terrorism, Assad is much better than the Saudis.” 
In September 2013, the Sunni states involved in the Qatar-Turkey pipeline were so determined to remove Syrian opposition to the pipeline that they offered, via John Kerry, to carry the whole cost of an U.S. invasion to topple al-Assad. 
Kerry reiterated the offer to Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL27): “With respect to Arab countries offering to bear the costs of [an American invasion] to topple Assad, the answer is profoundly Yes, they have. The offer is on the table.” 
Obama’s response: 
Despite pressure from Republicans, Barrack Obama balked at hiring out young Americans to die as mercenaries for a pipeline conglomerate . Obama wisely ignored Republican clamoring to put ground troops in Syria or to funnel more funding to “moderate insurgents.” But by late 2011, Republican pressure and our Sunni allies had pushed the American government into the fray. 
The rest is a history of provocation and over-reaction — a great deal of both — and chaos and death in Syria. Kennedy provides much detail here, at one point adding: 
[Syria’s] moderates are fleeing a war that is not their war . They simply want to escape being crushed between the anvil of Assad’s Russian backed tyranny and the vicious Jihadi Sunni hammer that we had a hand in wielding in a global battle over competing pipelines . You can’t blame the Syrian people for not widely embracing a blueprint for their nation minted in either Washington or Moscow. The super powers have left no options for an idealistic future that moderate Syrians might consider fighting for. And no one wants to die for a pipeline. 
I’ll leave it there, but again, do read the entire piece if you want to truly understand what’s going on in Syria, and what is about to go on. 
Bottom Line 
Bottom line, it’s as Kennedy said: “No one wants to die for a pipeline”… but many do and will. 
I’ll offer three thoughts. One , if we weren’t so determined to be deeply dependent on fossil fuels, this would be their war, not ours. Two , we are deeply dependent on fossil fuels because of the political machinations of the oil companies, their CEOs, and the banks and hedge funds who fund them, all of whom pay our government officials — via campaign contributions and the revolving door — to prolong that dependence. We’re here because the holders of big oil money want us here. 
And three , keep all this in mind during the term of the next president. It will help you make sense of the phony warrior- cum -humanitarian arguments we’re almost certain to be subjected to. 
We have been at war in Syria over pipelines since 1949. This is just the next mad phase. 0 0 0 0 1 1",1
20574,20574,Donald Trump All but Clinches G.O.P. Race With Indiana Win Ted Cruz Quits - The New York Times,Jonathan Martin and Patrick Healy,"Donald J. Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on Tuesday with a landslide win in Indiana that drove his principal opponent, Senator Ted Cruz, from the race and cleared the way for the polarizing, populist outsider to take control of the party. After months of sneering dismissals and expensive but impotent attacks from Republicans fearful of his candidacy, Mr. Trump is now positioned to clinch the required number of delegates for the nomination by the last day of voting on June 7. Facing only a feeble challenge from Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Mr. Trump is all but certain to roll into the Republican convention in July with the party establishment’s official but uneasy embrace. In the Democratic contest, Senator Bernie Sanders rebounded from a string of defeats to prevail in Indiana over Hillary Clinton, who largely abandoned the state after polls showed her faring poorly with the predominantly white electorate. But the outcome was not expected to significantly change Mrs. Clinton’s sizable lead in delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. Mr. Trump’s victory was an extraordinary moment in American political history: He is now on course to be the first   of a party since Dwight D. Eisenhower, a   general and the commander of Allied Forces in Europe during World War II, who had not served in elected office. Mr. Trump, a real estate tycoon turned reality television celebrity, was not a registered Republican until April 2012. He has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats, including his likely general election opponent, Mrs. Clinton. And, at various points in his life, he has held positions antithetical to Republican orthodoxy on almost every major issue in the conservative canon, including abortion, taxes, trade, and gun control. But none of this stopped him. With his ability to speak to the anxieties of voters, and his shrewd use of celebrity and memorable   Mr. Trump systematically undercut veteran politicians in a field of candidates that many in the party had hailed as the strongest in at least three decades. He was underestimated by leading Republicans and Democrats time and again, and he succeeded while spending far less money than most of his rivals and employing only a skeletal campaign staff. After Mr. Cruz exited the race Tuesday night, Mr. Trump appeared subdued and projected a more sober than usual mien as he absorbed the ramifications of the Indiana victory. “It has been some unbelievable day and evening and year  —   never been through anything like this,” Mr. Trump said. Putting aside the venom he has spewed at Mr. Cruz this year, Mr. Trump said of the senator, “He is one hell of a competitor. ” He even veered toward empathy for Mr. Cruz, saying he knew how “tough it is” to be brought low by a brutal defeat. Of the 17 Republicans who ran for president this cycle, Mr. Cruz  —   a onetime ally of Mr. Trump’s  —   proved to be his strongest and most tenacious rival, winning 11 primaries and caucuses. But the   senator’s appeal among traditional conservatives was no match for Mr. Trump’s fiery and uncompromising vow to fight for the interests of average Americans who have lost faith in the country’s political leadership. Republican primary voters made clear that they found Mr. Trump’s brand of   nationalism more attractive. Mr. Cruz, speaking to supporters in Indianapolis, said he could not fight on without “a viable path to victory. ” “Tonight I’m sorry to say it appears that path has been foreclosed,” he said, as some admirers called out for him to reconsider. Without mentioning Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Cruz said: “We gave it everything we got. But the voters chose another path. ” As remarkable as Mr. Trump’s achievement is, his expected nomination also poses undeniable peril to the party he is poised to lead. Republican leaders, who have been reluctant to embrace his candidacy, are watching him with great trepidation, and on Tuesday night they seemed to be grappling with the implications of Mr. Trump’s emergence as the new face of their party. No candidate since the dawn of modern polling has entered the general election with the sort of toxic image Mr. Trump has in the eyes of large groups of voters. Facing a race against the country’s first female   nominee, Mr. Trump is burdened with disapproval ratings as high as 70 percent among women, who make up a majority of voters in presidential elections. He is also an unpredictable voice on policy. At Trump Tower on Tuesday night, amid his litany of   Mr. Trump demonstrated the degree to which his nomination represented an astonishing break from political precedent. In denouncing Mrs. Clinton’s past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and saying it had caused “carnage” for American workers, he signaled he would run to her left on free trade and upend the   bipartisan consensus on the issue. Mr. Trump starts the general election campaign with a   roll of incendiary proposals and provocations that are the stuff of dreams for opposition researchers. He made his name in the last presidential campaign as the country’s most prominent birther, fueling debunked conspiracy theories that President Obama was not born in America he has used hostile and   language about Hispanics, suggesting that Mexican migrants are rapists and murderers and he has not backed off his proposal to bar all foreign Muslims from entering the United States, effectively creating a religious test for immigrants. No one is more eager to talk about those positions than Mrs. Clinton, who made clear on Tuesday that she wanted to sharpen her focus on Mr. Trump as soon as possible because the fight against him was likely to be bruising. “I’m really focused on moving into the general election,” Mrs. Clinton said during an interview on MSNBC. “And I think that’s where we have to be, because we’re going to have a tough campaign against a candidate who will literally say or do anything. ’’ Yet the Indiana results were an embarrassing reminder of her vulnerabilities: Only slightly more than half of Democrats voting Tuesday called Mrs. Clinton honest and trustworthy, according to early exit polls, a remarkably shaky assessment for the party’s likely nominee. After closing the gap with   white voters in parts of the Northeast last week, Mrs. Clinton lost them by 30 points in Indiana. She also again suffered with   independents casting ballots in the Democratic contest: 73 percent backed Mr. Sanders. Mr. Sanders, speaking to reporters after winning Indiana, had some tough words for Mrs. Clinton after a week when he toned down criticisms of her and shifted his focus to their policy differences. “I understand that Secretary Clinton thinks that this campaign is over,” Mr. Sanders said. “I’ve got some bad news for her. Tonight we won a great victory in Indiana. Next week we are going to be in West Virginia. We think we have a real shot to win in that great state. And then we’re going to Kentucky, and we’re going to Oregon. And we think we have a pretty good chance to win there as well. ” “We feel great about tonight not only in winning here in Indiana and accumulating some more delegates but also gaining the momentum we need to take us to the finish line,” he said, adding the he realized he faced an “uphill battle. ” While Mr. Sanders devoted three days to campaigning in Indiana and spent more than $1 million on television advertisements, Mrs. Clinton did not run any ads and spent only a day campaigning in the state, visiting the Indianapolis area. Clinton advisers said they saw no point in spending a couple of million dollars on television advertising and campaign travel when Mrs. Clinton was likely to lose the state anyway: Its Democratic primary electorate includes a healthy share of independents and newly registered voters, demographics that have repeatedly favored Mr. Sanders. And the two Democrats are expected to divide the state’s 83 delegates given the close outcome. Tad Devine, a senior adviser on the Sanders campaign, said that the Indiana results would not reshape the Democratic race markedly, given Mrs. Clinton’s sizable delegate lead. While the Democratic race has turned relatively civil, the Republican fight in Indiana grew bitter in the final hours. With Mr. Cruz on edge Tuesday morning about the future of his candidacy, Mr. Trump baited him by suggesting  —   with no evidence  —   that Mr. Cruz’s father had joined Lee Harvey Oswald in passing out   Castro pamphlets in New Orleans shortly before Oswald assassinated President John F. Kennedy. Mr. Cruz, unburdening himself after a campaign in which Mr. Trump also mocked his wife’s appearance, responded with a flourish, called Mr. Trump a “pathological liar” and delved into his rival’s personal life. “Listen, Donald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it,” Mr. Cruz said, directly raising Mr. Trump’s marital history for the first time. “I want everyone to think about your teenage kids. The president of the United States talks about how great it is to commit adultery. How proud he is. Describes his battles with venereal disease as his own personal Vietnam. ” But the appeal did not work. Indiana Republicans proved willing to embrace Mr. Trump, the once unimaginable but now virtually certain nominee, regardless of the personal flaws and political shortcomings that would have once derailed   presidents.",0
20575,20575,Desperate Trump Supporter Offers Voters Discount On Horse Semen If They Vote Trump,Jameson Parker,"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
After a trainwreck campaign, Trump supporters are struggling to find ways to motivate people to vote for their candidate. Trump has alienated nearly every voting bloc in the country, and routinely smears the sort of people who would otherwise be undecided voters. The question for his supporters is how to get people to set aside their hatred for the man and cast their vote for him anyway. For one horse breeder, the answer is semen. 
In what has been described as “gross,”“totally illegal,” and the most Trumpian thing ever, a Texas Trumper posted on his Facebook page that he would be giving a 50 percent off coupon to all Trump voters good for either one breeding session with his stallions, or frozen semen for the horse owner on the go. 
The post was flagged by Talking Points Memo’s Josh Marshall who noted that offering people compensation – even if it’s half off horse semen – for a vote for Trump violates election law. This is totally illegal; also perhaps the most appropriately Trumpian vote buying scheme possible to devise https://t.co/7n0kDam7ZS pic.twitter.com/f11T5dEOmR

20576,20576,Google Accused of Paying Women Less than Men - Breitbart,Chriss W. Street,"The U. S. Department of Labor (DOL) asked a San Francisco federal judge on April 7 to compel Google to provide detailed data regarding systemic gender pay discrimination. [With the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) making a preliminary determination that Google Inc. in its capacity as a federal contractor, has exhibited a pattern of pay discrimination against women, the DOL began a suit in front of a San Francisco Administrative Law Judge to compel Google to allow auditors to inspect and copy records and data about the company’s compliance with federal laws governing equal opportunity.  Google’s labor lawyer attorney Lisa Barnett Sween from Jackson Lewis stated that Google had complied with initial requests. But she argued that the DOL’s demand for employee names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses violated Google’s Constitutional Fourth Amendment right of protection against unreasonable searches. Silicon Valley CEOs view the DOL’s aggressive action against Google as the first salvo in President Obama’s January 29, 2016 Executive Order that expanded the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) gender compensation audits. Obama’s action came on the seventh anniversary of his signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. The Order directed the EEOC, in partnership with the DOL, to start collecting summary pay data by gender, race, and ethnicity from all private sector businesses with 100 or more employees. The White House stated that the audits would cover 63 million American workers and “focus public enforcement of our equal pay laws and provide better insight into discriminatory pay practices across industries and occupations. ” President Obama protested that he was forced to issue an Executive Order because Congress had refused to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act that he claimed would “give women additional tools to fight pay discrimination. ” Obama issued a report titled “The Gender Pay Gap on the Anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act,” which claimed that the U. S. gender wage gap is now 2. 5 percentage points worse than the average for industrialized countries, after the world reduced the pay gap by 7 percentage points since 2000. DOL Regional Director Janette Wipper testified that the government had collected information to show that Google is violating federal EEOC laws on wages: “We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce. ” Despite California being the eighth  best state in the U. S. for gender equality, the DOL may have chosen to go after Google knowing the U. S. Ninth Circuit has a reputation as America’s most liberal venue. The DOL filed discrimination lawsuits against Palantir in September for alleged systematic hiring discrimination against Asian job applicants and sued Oracle in January claiming that the company paid white men more than other racial groups. Both company deny the charges as “politically motivated. ”",0
20577,20577,Re: Will The FBI Email Investigation Shed New Light On The Lolita Express And Other Clinton Sex Scandals?,Rick,"Email 
Could it be possible that the newly discovered Clinton emails that the FBI is currently examining contain evidence of crimes other than just the mishandling of classified documents? For years, there have been shocking allegations about the sexual behavior of both Bill and Hillary Clinton in the conservative media, but neither Bill nor Hillary has ever been convicted of a sexual crime. However, that may be about to change. There is nobody on the planet that has been closer to Hillary Clinton over the past decade than Huma Abedin, and now the FBI has their hands on approximately 650,000 emails that were stored on electronic devices owned by her and her estranged husband Anthony Weiner. Without a doubt, many of those emails will relate to the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified documents, but many of those emails will also be personal in nature. So what will the FBI learn about the Clinton sex scandals from those emails, and will that information be shared with the American public? 
In particular, any information regarding Clinton ties to Jeffrey Epstein and “the Lolita Express” could be extremely explosive. 
Bill and Hillary Clinton were both very good friends of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein before he was convicted of soliciting sex from a young girl in 2008. In fact, flight records show that Bill Clinton was a frequent passenger on Epstein’s plane that eventually came to be known as “the Lolita Express”… 
Bill Clinton took repeated trips on the “ Lolita Express “—the private passenger jet owned by billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein—with an actress in softcore porn movies whose name appears in Epstein’s address book under an entry for “massages,” according to flight logbooks obtained by Gawker and published today for the first time . The logs also show that Clinton shared more than a dozen flights with a woman who federal prosecutors believe procured underage girls to sexually service Epstein and his friends and acted as a “potential co-conspirator” in his crimes . 
Overall, Bill took at least 26 trips on board “the Lolita Express”. Fox News says that the plane “earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.” 
But sex with underage girls didn’t just happen on the plane. One of the favorite destinations for “the Lolita Express” was Epstein’s 72-acre “Orgy Island”. Here is more from Fox News … 
“Bill Clinton … associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile,” said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called “TrafficKing.” “Why would a former president associate with a man like that?” 
Epstein, who counts among his pals royal figures, heads of state, celebrities and fellow billionaires, spent 13 months in prison and home detention for solicitation and procurement of minors for prostitution. He allegedly had a team of traffickers who procured girls as young as 12 to service his friends on “Orgy Island,” an estate on Epstein’s 72-acre island, called Little St. James, in the U.S. Virgin Islands . 
Are you starting to understand how serious this could be? 
If Bill Clinton had sex with an underage girl just one time, that would be enough to potentially send him to prison for the rest of his life. 
Court records show that Jeffrey Epstein had 21 different phone numbers for Bill Clinton. To say that they were close would be a massive understatement. 
And what was the nature of Hillary Clinton’s involvement with Jeffrey Epstein? 
There are so many unanswered questions, and I don’t know what these 650,000 emails are going to show. But there are persistent whispers that law enforcement officials that were looking through them for the Anthony Weiner case found something big. 
And the truth is that the FBI would have never renewed this investigation so close to the election unless a gamechanger had been discovered. FBI Director James Comey had to know that he was going to take a tremendous amount of heat for this decision, and to move forward on something like this without good reason would be career suicide. 
For the moment, Hillary Clinton is putting on a brave face. On Monday, she challenged the FBI to hurry up and read her emails so that they could see that she had nothing to hide… 
With eight days remaining until Election Day, Hillary Clinton told a crowd of supporters here Monday that the FBI should hurry up and check out the additional emails that agents said they found while investigating the estranged husband of one of her aides. 
“Go ahead. Look at them,” the Democratic nominee said about the emails that may have been originally housed on a private server she used as secretary of state — a revelation that has thrown the presidential election into turmoil. 
Maybe Clinton is telling the truth, but with her you just never know. As I recently explained to a live studio audience down at Morningside , Hillary Clinton is a habitual liar and it is hard to trust her about anything at this point. 
If she is lying about these emails, hopefully we will find out very quickly. 
Her opponent, Donald Trump, seems energized by this new scandal, and he is warning that America may be facing a “constitutional crisis” if Clinton wins the election… 
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, buoyed by tightening polls and a renewed controversy over Democrat Hillary Clinton, told an enthusiastic crowd in suburban Grand Rapids Monday that the U.S. could face a “constitutional crisis” if Clinton is elected president on Nov. 8. 
Trump predicted a “protracted criminal investigation and probably a criminal trial,” and said “nothing will get done.” 
FBI Director James Comey has “brought back his reputation” by reactivating an investigation into the handling of her State Department e-mails , Trump said to loud cheers. 
But the cold, hard reality of the matter is that we could potentially be facing something much more serious than just a “constitutional crisis”. 
If the FBI finds evidence of very serious crimes committed by Hillary Clinton, she could actually be forced to withdraw from the race on the eve of the election, and that would throw the entire process into a state of chaos . 
Even so, it is exceedingly important that the American people get the truth about what is in these emails, and hopefully that will happen as rapidly as possible.

20578,20578,Re: Don’t Let James Comey and the FBI’s October Surprise Fool You!,Zoe2010,"Email 
It’s not exactly breaking news that only an infinitesimally small number of people in this country trust the mainstream media to report the truth, so it shouldn’t come as a great shock that the mainstream media is getting people all ginned up about James Comey’s announcement today regarding the “re-opening of the investigation” into Hillary Clinton’s private email server, or as the letter to Congress said, “taking appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” 
What does come as a bit of a shock, is how many people are buying into the hype. At this point in the election, hasn’t anyone learned that NOTHING is what it seems when first reported by the media? Anyone at all? “But… but… but… the media says that Comey’s announcement took everyone by surprise… even the President…” 
Right… and I've got some oceanfront property in Arizona I'd like to sell you. Are you interested? Correct me if I'm wrong, but are we talking about the same media that less than 10% of Americans thinks is honest and trustworthy? Exactly! My fellow countrymen, especially my fellow Trump supporters, beware! Beware that we don't all get lured into a perfect example of ""rope a dope,"" by the very same people and institutions we already know haven't given us the honest truth about much of anything since long before this election season began. 
In the video below, I review the facts that cannot be denied, and ask the question, “Why isn’t the media telling you this?” 
The RT Reports: 
The FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation. 
“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of email that appear to be pertinent” to Clinton’s investigation, Comey wrote to the chairs of several relevant congressional committees, adding that he was briefed about the messages on Thursday. “I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.” 
The FBI director cautioned, however, that the bureau has yet to assess the importance of the material, and that he doesn’t know how long that will take. 
The Clinton campaign has yet to comment, but an aide told CNN: “We’re learning about this just like you all are.” 
Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine was asked about Comey’s letter while campaigning at an early voting site in Tallahassee, Florida. “Gotta read a little more, gotta read a little more,” he told reporters. 
Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Virginia), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, praised the decision to reopen the case. 
“Now that the FBI has reopened the matter, it must conduct the investigation with impartiality and thoroughness,” he said in a statement. “The American people deserve no less and no one should be above the law.” 
Almost 15,000 new Clinton emails were discovered in September, but it's unclear if the announced investigation relates to them or other correspondence. The newly discovered emails are not related to Wikileaks or the Clinton Foundation, law enforcement sources told CNN’s Evan Perez. 
The messages were not found on the private email server in the Clintons’ New York residence, a government source told Reuters. 
The emails were apparently discovered as part of the sexting probe into former Representative Anthony Weiner (D-New York), the New York Times reported. His electronic devices, as well as those belonging to his wife, senior Clinton aide Huma Abedin, were seized during that investigation. 
House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin) renewed his call for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to “suspend all classified briefings for Secretary Clinton until this matter is fully resolved.” 
“Yet again, Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame,” Ryan said in a statement. “This decision, long overdue, is the result of her reckless use of a private email server, and her refusal to be forthcoming with federal investigators.” 
Kellyanne Conway, Republican nominee Donald Trump ’s campaign manager, applauded the decision. 
“That is superb. That is extraordinary news for the American people,” she told Yahoo News. ""A great day in our campaign just got even better,"" she tweeted. 
“They are reopening the case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States,” Trump said in Manchester, New Hampshire, 10 minutes after learning about the reopening of the case. “We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.” 
“I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made,” he said. “This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understand, and it is everybody’s hope that it is about to be corrected.” 
“With that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech?” he joked before turning to his prepared remarks. 
The “FBI reopening investigation isn’t an October surprise, it’s an October nuclear explosion,” conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro wrote as part of a tweetstorm, adding that “Comey [is] trying to cover his a** 11 days before [the] election” and wondering if a “pre-emptive impeachment of a president elect” is possible because “the odds on President Tim Kaine just rose substantially.” 
An ‘October Surprise‘ is a major event that happens in the month before the election that affects the outcome of the vote. 
In response to the announcement, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint with the Department of Justice against Comey. 
“It is absolutely absurd that FBI Director Comey would support Donald Trump like this with only 11 days to go before the election,” Scott Dworkin, senior advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump , said in a statement . “It is an obvious attack from a lifelong Republican who used to serve in the Bush White House, just to undermine her campaign. Comey needs to focus on stopping terrorists and protecting America, not investigating our soon to be President-Elect Hillary Clinton.” 
Stocks fell after Comey’s announcement, CNBC reported.

People have now learned and accepted that Trump is inevitably the new president of the United States. They try to figure out what that means. We do not know, neither does anyone else. A lot of rumors and speculation are circling of who will take up this or that job in a Trump administration. These rumors are mostly created by those who would like that job, or their personal lobbies. They should be ignored. 
The mainstream media is barely able to issue a mea culpa for their extreme pro-Clinton campaign and total failure of reporting the real state of the union. It is now looking for obfuscations like claiming no one could have gotten it right. That is a cheap excuse for incompetence. 
It is astonishing that THE media outlet that did the most to shine lights on Clinton is ignored in any of the main stream after-election reporting. I am talking of Wikileaks and Julian Assange who did their very best, under high personal risk, to report the truth about Clinton's and the DNC's utter corruption. A big thank you to them! 
Clinton in her very late concession speech, found no words for her culpability or that of the campaign she ran. But the loss of the running is her personal failure. The ""bernie bros"" and ""deplorables"" thanked her hostility by not showing up to vote. She had 6 million votes less than Obama while Trump got about the same number as Romney! Instead of focusing on Trump's disastrous economic program she ran a warmongering ""blame Putin"" campaign. Her economic program was tinkering on the margins of the neoliberal status quo. Certainly not what voters in difficult financial situations, and there are a lots of those in today's U.S., needed to hear. There are now attempts to get Clinton pardoned for breaking classification laws and rules with her private email server as well as for her tax cheating, private slush fund ""charity"", the Clinton Foundation. If the Democrats want to keep at least some appearance of uprightness they should fight all such attempts. Let her pay a very heft penalty for her shenanigans. 
  apparatus is corrupt and was completely on Clinton's side. It cost the party the presidency as well as the House and any progress in the Senate. I find it very likely that Sanders would have won the primaries if the party apparatus had acted as neutral as it should have. He had a much better chance of beating Trump. With Sanders as candidate in the general election House and Senate seats would have been easier to keep or to win. There is an urgent and thorough cleanup needed in the party from top to bottom. Sanders should be given the lead of the party and be tasked to again win a majority in the House and/or Senate in the 2018 midterm election. 
Trumps true program will now come to the fore. A lot of stuff he said during the campaign will soon be forgotten. His economic program is a repeat of Reaganomics with a dose of isolationism in trade. How that is going to work out with the pivot to Asia and countering China is a mystery . His stand against Muslims was fake, as he let the embassies of the Gulf states know early on. 
The military will get more money for lots of funny programs. That is nothing new. It just build some $7.5 billion a piece battleships solely for their new, very special guns which now will not be used because their special ammunition is, at $800,000 a shot, too expensive. A total waste of money but at least it paid for some good jobs. (More jobs could have been created with that money in more important, non-military programs.) 
Trump will cut taxes for big enterprises and the rich. He will cut social programs. The general budget will go deep into red. In a few years he will have to, just like Reagan, increase taxes to regain some budget balance. 
His campaign unleashed a new wave of racism. Racism had not vanished - indeed it was very much in the open during Obama's time. But open hostile incidents against ""the other"" will probably increase. It will be difficult and take some time to reign it in again. 
It will be important to oppose Trump as much as possible. He is a somewhat megalomaniac and he currently has party majorities in both houses. He will have to be taught that not everything he tries is good or even possible. Trump will want a reelection and another four years as president. He can face opposition on the ground, from people who voted for him, if those people can see a plausible alternative . Clintonian tinkering on the edges of the status quo is no such alternative. There needs to be broad stroke economic policy, plausible and explainable, that offers a better world to them. If the Democrats, or a third party, can develop and present such a program there is good chance that the era of Trump will be a short unremarkable chapter in the history books.   10, 2016 at 02:09 PM | Permalink",1
20581,20581,"Joanna Coles, Cosmopolitan Editor, Named to New Job at Hearst - The New York Times",Sydney Ember,"Not long ago, Joanna Coles was having lunch with David Carey, the president of Hearst magazines, when he suggested she should take on a bigger role at the company. Ms. Coles had been the editor in chief of Cosmopolitan since 2012 and, she said in an interview, “I was definitely ready to do something else. ” “I love Cosmo, but I gave it everything I had,” she said. “I just didn’t have another sex position in me. ” On Tuesday, Hearst announced that Ms. Coles would leave her post at Cosmopolitan, one of the company’s marquee publications, to become Hearst’s first chief content officer. In her new role, Ms. Coles will work closely with Hearst editors and oversee the company’s magazines in the United States and internationally. She will also look to identify new business opportunities and partnerships for Hearst in areas including television and live events, with the goal of extending the company’s brands beyond just print magazines and websites. Michele Promaulayko, who worked at Cosmopolitan as executive editor from 2000 to 2008, will succeed Ms. Coles as the magazine’s editor in chief. Ms. Promaulayko was previously the editor in chief of Yahoo Health and has served as editor in chief of the magazine Women’s Health. Ms. Promaulayko will also become editorial director of Seventeen magazine. In an interview, Mr. Carey called the new role for Ms. Coles a “natural next step for our company and for Joanna. ” Hearst has formed many partnerships in recent years, but lately, he said, many companies who wanted to work with Hearst reached out to Ms. Coles first. “I’ve watched Joanna lead Cosmo,” Mr. Carey said, “and the whole time, I thought she could make an even bigger impact. ” Ms. Coles, 54, started working at Hearst in 2006 as editor in chief of Marie Claire, and she has raised her profile and that of the magazines under her leadership since then. With Marie Claire, she had a hand in a partnership between the magazine and the popular television show “Project Runway. ” At Cosmopolitan, where she took the reins four years ago, she has greatly extended the magazine’s reach, notably forging a partnership with Snapchat that both companies have viewed as a success. Cosmopolitan’s Snapchat channel draws six million visitors a day, according to Hearst. Ms. Coles calls herself a “brand steward,” and in many ways, she has become the public face of not only Cosmopolitan but Hearst itself. She frequently speaks at media conferences, has active Twitter and Instagram accounts and recently joined the board of Snapchat. On the television side, she is helping to produce the E! reality show about young Cosmopolitan employees (she will be in the show, but, she said, “I’ll be less in it than I was going to be”) and is involved in a scripted series for the   network Freeform, called “Issues,” that is inspired by her life. She is also writing a book about sex and intimacy in the digital age. Cosmopolitan under Ms. Coles has not lost its sizzle, and its pages are filled with the relationship advice and sex tips that have made it a popular guide for young women for decades. But it has also taken on heavier subjects, including women’s health and politics. The magazine reached roughly 34 million people in July across print, digital and video, according to the Magazine Media 360 Brand Audience. That was up from 29. 5 million at the end of 2014. Ms. Coles said she was leaving Cosmopolitan in a position of strength, but that she was “really excited to do a bigger job. ” Though she was   on her plans, she said she had two projects she has been working on with other Hearst brands, which will be announced soon.",0
20582,20582,New Trump Deportation Rules Allow Far More Expulsions - The New York Times,Michael D. Shear and Ron Nixon,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump has directed his administration to enforce the nation’s immigration laws more aggressively, unleashing the full force of the federal government to find, arrest and deport those in the country illegally, regardless of whether they have committed serious crimes. Documents released on Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security revealed the broad scope of the president’s ambitions: to publicize crimes by undocumented immigrants strip such immigrants of privacy protections enlist local police officers as enforcers erect new detention facilities discourage asylum seekers and, ultimately, speed up deportations. The new enforcement policies put into practice language that Mr. Trump used on the campaign trail, vastly expanding the definition of “criminal aliens” and warning that such unauthorized immigrants “routinely victimize Americans,” disregard the “rule of law and pose a threat” to people in communities across the United States. Despite those assertions in the new documents, research shows lower levels of crime among immigrants than among   Americans. The president’s new immigration policies are likely to be welcomed by some law enforcement officials around the country, who have called for a tougher crackdown on unauthorized immigrants, and by some Republicans in Congress who have argued that lax enforcement encourages a   flow of unauthorized immigrants. But taken together, the new policies are a rejection of the sometimes more restrained efforts by former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush and their predecessors, who sought to balance protecting the nation’s borders with fiscal, logistical and humanitarian limits on the exercise of laws passed by Congress. “The faithful execution of our immigration laws is best achieved by using all these statutory authorities to the greatest extent practicable,” John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, wrote in one of two memorandums released on Tuesday. “Accordingly, department personnel shall make full use of these authorities. ” The immediate impact of that shift is not yet fully known. Advocates for immigrants warned on Tuesday that the new border control and enforcement directives would create an atmosphere of fear that was likely to drive those in the country illegally deeper into the shadows. Administration officials said some of the new policies  —   like one seeking to send unauthorized border crossers from Central America to Mexico while they await deportation hearings  —   could take months to put in effect and might be limited in scope. For now,   Dreamers, who were brought to the United States as young children, will not be targeted unless they commit crimes, officials said on Tuesday. Mr. Trump has not yet said where he will get the billions of dollars needed to pay for thousands of new border control agents, a network of detention facilities to detain unauthorized immigrants and a wall along the entire southern border with Mexico. But politically, Mr. Kelly’s actions on Tuesday serve to reinforce the president’s standing among a core constituency  —   those who blame unauthorized immigrants for taking jobs away from citizens, committing heinous crimes and being a financial burden on federal, state and local governments. And because of the changes, millions of immigrants in the country illegally now face a far greater likelihood of being discovered, arrested and eventually deported. “The message is: The immigration law is back in business,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports restricted immigration. “That violating immigration law is no longer a secondary offense. ” Lawyers and advocates for immigrants said the new policies could still be challenged in court. Maricopa County in Arizona spent years defending its sheriff at the time, Joseph Arpaio, in federal court, where he was found to have discriminated against Latinos. And courts in Illinois, Oregon, Pennsylvania and several other states have rejected the power given to local and state law enforcement officers to hold immigrants for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release from detention at the request of federal authorities under a program known as Secure Communities, which Mr. Trump is reviving. “When you tell state and local police that their job is to do immigration enforcement,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, “it translates into the unwarranted and illegal targeting of people because of their race, because of their language, because of the color of their skin. ” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the president wanted to “take the shackles off” of the nation’s immigration enforcers. He insisted that the new policies made it clear that “the No. 1 priority is that people who pose a threat to our country are immediately dealt with. ” In fact, that was already the policy under the Obama administration, which instructed agents that undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes were the priority for deportation. Now, enforcement officials have been directed to seek the deportation of anyone in the country illegally. “Under this executive order, ICE will not exempt classes or categories of removal aliens from potential enforcement,” a fact sheet released by the Department of Homeland Security said, using the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “All of those present in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention, and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States. ” That includes people convicted of fraud in any official matter before a governmental agency and people who “have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits. ” The policy also expands a program that lets officials bypass due process protections such as court hearings in some deportation cases. Under the Obama administration, the program, known as “expedited removal,” was used only when an immigrant was arrested within 100 miles of the border and had been in the country no more than 14 days. Now it will include all those who have been in the country for up to two years, no matter where they are caught. “The administration seems to be putting its foot down as far as the gas pedal will go,” said Heidi Altman, policy director for the National Immigrant Justice Center, a   group that offers legal services to immigrants. In the documents released on Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security is directed to begin the process of hiring 10, 000 immigration and customs agents, expanding the number of detention facilities and creating an office within Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help families of those killed by undocumented immigrants. The directives would also revive a program that recruits local police officers and sheriff’s deputies to help with deportation, effectively making them de facto immigration agents. The effort, called the 287( g) program, was scaled back during the Obama administration. The program faces resistance from many states and dozens of   sanctuary cities, which have refused to allow their law enforcement workers to help round up undocumented individuals. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio in a statement on Tuesday pledged the city’s cooperation in cases involving “proven public safety threats,” but vowed that “what we will not do is turn our N. Y. P. D. officers into immigration agents. ” Under the new directives, the agency would no longer provide privacy protections to people who are not American citizens or green card holders. A policy established in the last days of the Bush administration in January 2009 provided some legal protection for information collected by the Department of Homeland Security on nonresidents. The new policies also target unauthorized immigrants who smuggle their children into the country, as happened with Central American children seeking to reunite with parents living in the United States. Under the new directives, such parents could face deportation or prosecution for smuggling or human trafficking. Officials said that returning Central American refugees to Mexico to await hearings would be done only in a limited fashion, and only after discussions with the government of Mexico. Mexican officials said on Tuesday that such a move could violate Mexican law and international accords governing repatriation, and immigrants’ advocates questioned Mexico’s ability to absorb thousands of Central Americans in detention centers and shelters.",0
20583,20583,ESPN SportsCenter Anchor Linda Cohn: Those Who Ignore Politics Problem at ESPN are ’Blind’ - Breitbart,Robert J. Marlow,"“SportsCenter” anchor Linda Cohn stated on Thursday what Breitbart News has been asserting for years: that ESPN’s constant insertion of politics in their sports coverage contributed to the network’s massive loss of subscribers over the last five years. [ESPN has pushed a narrative that the loss of about 12 million subscribers, down to 88 million from its 100 million subscriber high in 2011, is due to viewers preferring to watch streaming video platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and others, which can be purchased at a considerably lower price than cable packages.  The popular host commented on 77 WABC’s “Bernie and Sid” show that broadcasters sharing political opinions definitely turned off some viewers, prompting them to turn off ESPN. “That is definitely a percentage of it,” said Cohn when asked whether certain social or political opinions played a part in the “bloodbath” this week when parent company Disney ordered the firing of some 100 employees. Most of those let go were radio and TV   broadcasters and sports writers. “I don’t know how big a percentage, but if anyone wants to ignore that fact, they’re blind. “You know, when you work for a big company, you have to follow in line, you have to pay the bills. But you just kind of look in the mirror and do what you think is right no matter what else is going on around you. And that’s what I always tried to do. ” According to the New York Post, the    ESPN veteran believes that certain sports fans did not like the way the network covered controversial personalities like Roger Goodell, Colin Kaepernick, and Caitlyn Jenner. Cohn cited ESPN’s granting of the 2015 Arthur Ashe Award for Courage to Jenner, right after Bruce transitioned to Caitlyn, as an example of a political statement that turned off viewers. Many felt that athletes suffering from disease or disability  —   particularly women’s basketball player Lauren Hill, who died from cancer three months before the ESPY Award Show, and   marathoner Noah Galloway who lost an arm and a leg in the Iraq War, would have been better selections for the prestigious award.",0

20589,20589,Just Another Day In the Life of the Clinton Crime Family,Dave Hodges,"Just Another Day In the Life of the Clinton Crime Family 

In the past 24 hours, some very stunning pieces of information have leaked out regarding the Clinton Crime Family. I am shocked about how pervasive the criminality is in what has been only a 24 hour news cycle. Assange’s Lawyers Are Dead 
There are two lawyers who represented WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, who died and their deaths were in very close proximity, only a mere month apart. 
Assange attorney, John Jones, suicide was committed by the top lawyer when he jumped in front of a train in West Hamstead, in which the police did not even consider the possibility of foul play. The authorities, courtesy of the Clinton Foundation, found nothing suspicious about the manner of Jones’ death. 
Michael Ratner made a career out of defending government whistle-blowers and detainees, something that one could argue was right inside of Assange’s wheelhouse. Ratner’s death was shrouded in mystery. It is important to note that Ratner had actually sued three sitting US Presidents and tried to get George W. Bush impeached for lying America into the Iraq war. Certainly, when someone like Ratner who had begun to represent Assange, was a terrible threat to the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation and had to be dealt with. Chief Investigator for Bill Clinton’s Impeachment Trial Lives In Fear of His Life 
Aaron Klein, yes the same Aaron Klein who released emails, before they were purged, which demonstrated that Clinton was sending out, through her personal server the travel plans of Ambassador Stevens prior to his death at Benghazi, recently interview Dave Shippers the Chief Investigator of Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial. Shippers professed that he still lives in fear of his life. 
“Today, I am still terrified of Hillary. Absolutely I am terrified. Because if she gets into office. In fact, I’ve told my wife, I said, ‘If Hillary gets elected, look for the FBI or somebody to come and pick me up the next day.’ 
“And I think I’m the only one left. [Former Congressman] Henry Hyde is dead. [Independent Counsel Kenneth] Star didn’t really hurt her. Yeah. I was scared when I was out there… I’ve been terrified ever since. Because things happen. Things happen.” 
Klein allowed his interview to drift into the area of Vince Foster’s alleged suicide which Shippers was convinced that his event was a murder designed to cover up Hillary Clinton’s criminal behavior. Shippers also mentioned the impeachment investigation, centering around Clinton lying about his affair with Monica Lewinski, uncovered evidence of at least three murders connected to Hillary Clinton. However, as Shippers stated, the investigation was limited to to the Lewinski angle. This is really ashame because of the fact that Hillary Clinton could have been stopped in the 1990’s and this nation would not, today, be fighting for its life under the threat of an extinction level event such as the specter of a Clinton Presidency. Anthony Weiner Fears for His Life At the Hands of Hillary Clinton 
The perverted Congressman, who could not stop sexting grossly inappropriate images of himself to underage girls, may have unwittingly put another very large nail in the political coffin of Hillary Rodham Clinton. According to sources , we now know that the FBI accidentally discovered that Weiner had several emails that were suspiciously marked “life insurance” and the FBI found that these email were directly related to the FBI’s investigation of Hillary Clinton. 
Disturbingly, these same sources indicated that the sources were turned over to the FBI over a month ago while the FBI was still running interference for the Clinton Crime Family. It is very concerning that Comey never mentioned these damning emails. 
The NYPD had the same information and they planned to leak the information despite intense pressure not to do so. This information not only shows that Anthony Weiner was in extreme fear of his life, from the Clintons, that he actually created his Julian Assange’s style of a dead man’s switch in the event of his death. I would add, that Huma may want to avoid subway trains and airplanes for awhile for her own safety. I predict that Weiner will become a star witness in either the immediate take down of Hillary, or her impeachment trial should George Soros be able to steal the election for her. Conclusion For the good of the country, Hillary needs to step down immediately. She has made our justice system and nation, as a whole, a complete laughing stock. Anyone, and I mean anyone, who would vote for Hillary Clinton, needs to take a long look in the mirror and ask yourself what kind of person are you. How can you face your kids and claim to be a moral authority in their lives and vote for this evil monster? This is just another day in the life of the Clinton Crime Family.",1
20590,20590,United Airlines Passenger Is Dragged From an Overbooked Flight - The New York Times,Daniel Victor and Matt Stevens,"The disturbing scene captured on cellphone videos by United Airlines passengers on Sunday went beyond the typical nightmares of travelers on an overbooked flight. An unidentified man who refused to be bumped from a plane screamed as a security officer wrestled him out of his seat and dragged him down the aisle by his arms. His glasses slid down his face, and his shirt rose above his midriff as uniformed officers followed. At least two passengers documented the physical confrontation and the man’s anguished protests, and their videos spread rapidly online on Monday as people criticized the airline’s tactics. A security officer involved in the episode has been placed on leave, the authorities said, and the federal Transportation Department is investigating whether the airline complied with rules regarding overbooking. Tyler Bridges, a passenger on Sunday’s flight who posted a video to Twitter, said in a telephone interview on Monday that “it felt like something the world needed to see. ” The shocking scene raised questions about the common practice of overbooking and how far airlines will go to sell all of their seats. Particularly annoying, Mr. Bridges said, was that the airline was looking for extra seats for some of its employees. The videos show a security officer removing the unidentified man from his seat and dragging him off the plane as he screams. The flight was scheduled to depart O’Hare International Airport in Chicago for Louisville, Ky. at 5:40 p. m. but was delayed two hours. Charlie Hobart, a United spokesman, said in a telephone interview on Monday that “we had asked several times, politely,” for the man to give up his seat before force was used. “We had a customer who refused to leave the aircraft,” he said. “We have a number of customers on board that aircraft, and they want to get to their destination on time and safely, and we want to work to get them there. “Since that customer refused to leave the aircraft, we had to call” the police, and they came on board, he said. The Chicago Department of Aviation said in a statement on Monday that the incident “was not in accordance with our standard operating procedure” and that an officer had been placed on leave pending a review of the matter. The department declined to identify the officer. Airlines routinely sell tickets to more people than the plane can seat, counting on several people not to arrive. When there are not enough   airlines first try to offer rewards to customers willing to reschedule their plans, usually in the form of travel vouchers, gift cards or cash. The arrangement  —   which is usually negotiated before passengers board the plane  —   can be lucrative to flexible travelers and is crucial for airlines to maximize profit. “A bakery doesn’t want to have a lot of extra pastries at the end of the day they have to throw out,” said Seth Kaplan, managing partner at Airline Weekly, an industry publication. “To an airline, an empty seat is basically the same thing as stale bread. It’s something they can never sell again. ” But involuntarily bumping passengers is rare. In 2016, United involuntarily denied boarding to 3, 765 of its more than 86 million passengers on oversold flights, according to the Transportation Department. An additional 62, 895 people voluntarily gave up their seats.  The event on Sunday was the second social media stir for United in two weeks. In March, two girls were barred from a flight because they were wearing leggings, which the company said violated its dress code for a benefit for United employees and their dependents. Critics called the policy sexist and overbearing. On Sunday, Mr. Bridges said that when he arrived at the gate about 20 minutes before boarding, United had announced that the flight was overbooked the airline was offering $400 vouchers to anyone who would give up their seat, Mr. Bridges said. As the passengers boarded the plane, “there was no indication anything was wrong,” Mr. Bridges said. An airline employee came on board and said United needed four people to get off, Mr. Bridges said, adding that the airline had by then increased its incentive to an $800 voucher. The airline later said that it offered up to $1, 000 in compensation. Mr. Hobart, the United spokesman, confirmed that United sought passengers willing to give up their seats with compensation but that none stepped forward. Another United employee told passengers that the plane would not leave until four people got off, Mr. Bridges said. The employee specified that the airline had four United employees who needed to get to Louisville, he said. Four passengers were selected to be bumped, and three left without incident, Mr. Hobart said. Mr. Hobart would not say whether the bumped passengers were chosen by a computer, an employee or some combination of the two. But factors can include how long a customer would have to stay at the airport before being rebooked, he said, and the airline looks to avoid separating families or leaving unaccompanied minors. A United employee first approached a couple who appeared to be in their   Mr. Bridges said, and the pair begrudgingly got off the plane. Then the United employee went to a man five rows behind Mr. Bridges and told him he needed to get off the plane. Mr. Bridges said the man told the employee: “I’m not getting off the plane. I’m a doctor I have to see patients in the morning. ” Mr. Hobart said: “We explained the scenario to the customer. That customer chose not to get out of his seat. ” The United employee then told the man that if he did not get off the plane, she would call security. As she turned to leave, the man shouted after her, Mr. Bridges said. Specifically, he said, the passenger complained that he had been singled out because he was Chinese. “It was really intense, really uncomfortable,” he said. The situation also became uncomfortable for the United employees who then got on board and took the vacated seats, Mr. Bridges said. They were berated by passengers and told they should be ashamed, he said. The man who had been removed returned to the flight briefly, Mr. Bridges said. Video shows him jogging through the aisle, repeatedly saying, “I have to go home. ” Jayse Anspach, a seminary student who was also on the flight, said that when the man returned to the plane, he ran toward the back. It was not clear how the man had managed to board again. At one point, the authorities and medics surrounded the man and gave him tissues for his mouth, which was bleeding, Mr. Anspach said. Eventually the man moved to the front of the plane and collapsed sideways into a seat before being taken off the plane on a stretcher, Mr. Anspach said. In a statement, Oscar Munoz, the chief executive of United Airlines, called the episode “an upsetting event. ” He said the company apologized for having to “reaccommodate” the customers. “Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened,” he said. “We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly to him and further address and resolve this situation. ” In a statement, United said, “We apologize for the overbook situation. ” Andrew D. Gilman, the chief executive of CommCore Consulting Group, a crisis communications firm, said the situation would probably make people reconsider whether they wanted to fly United. That could be particularly damaging with business passengers, a lucrative group that is “outraged as much as anybody,” he said. “As somebody who flies hundreds of thousands of miles, I’m saying, ‘I thought once I was on the plane, it was my seat,’” Mr. Gilman said. “They unfortunately disrupted a number of certainties that people tend to rely upon, so I think it’s a big trust thing. ” Mr. Gilman said the episode was “also going to be really hard on their employees for a while. ” “It’s a hard enough job  —   high stress, tense people, delays  —   and now you have people who are suspicious of you,” he said. “How they can communicate that they were sincere and meant well is going to be very challenging. ”",0
20591,20591,"Don’t Root, Root, Root for the Racist, Red-Face Team from Cleveland",Henry Wolff,"Don’t Root, Root, Root for the Racist, Red-Face Team from Cleveland Paul Thornton, Los Angeles Times, October 26, 2016 
How I wish it were the Dodgers who took the field Tuesday night in Cleveland. Yes, we’re all sad in Los Angeles that our team is now one year closer to celebrating the 30th anniversary of its last World Series appearance, but this goes beyond provincialism and wounded civil pride. 
The Dodgers deserved the chance to humiliate a Cleveland baseball team that not only persists in identifying itself as the “Indians,” but also resurrected the laughably racist, red-faced mascot Chief Wahoo just in time for the playoffs. 
For those who haven’t kept up with the baseball drama, here’s a summary: The Cleveland team drew the curtain on its regular-season minstrel show in the spring, having replaced Chief Wahoo on its caps with a vintage red “C.” It never officially retired the offending mascot, but Wahoo remained confined only to uniform sleeves throughout the regular season, leading reasonable people to believe that the team ownership had finally seen the light where other franchises such as the NFL’s Washington Redskins remained defiantly in the dark, and was easing its fans into the post-“Indians” era. 
Or so we thought. Chief Wahoo reappeared when the Cleveland team began its impressive playoff run against the Boston Red Sox, and he hasn’t left. He remained stitched on hats and held aloft by adoring Cleveland fans as the team convincingly defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, even surviving a legal attack by advocates of Canada’s indigenous peoples that threatened to forbid even so much as the use of the term “Indians” while the team was on Canadian soil. 
{snip} 
It’s tempting to look past all this and take pity on a city that’s had it as rough as Cleveland. The Cubs’ championship drought has famously lasted for 107 baseball seasons, but the Cleveland team boasts a pitiable 67 years without a World Series title. Beyond sports, Cleveland’s decline as an important American metropolis is arguably unmatched, having tumbled from a population peak of 900,000-plus in 1950 to less than 400,000 today. {snip} 
But Cleveland? Hey, I know some generous, wonderfully caring people from that part of Ohio, which makes wishing for their team’s brutal defeat personally difficult. But being on the right side of a moral dispute isn’t supposed to be easy, especially when the team in question isn’t the evil Washington Redskins and its infernal owner, Daniel Snyder. Cleveland’s municipal misery doesn’t excuse the disgraceful exalting of Chief Wahoo any more than white men’s economic hardship makes Donald Trump’s popularity OK.

20592,20592,Trust Records Show Trump Is Still Closely Tied to His Empire - The New York Times,Susanne Craig and Eric Lipton,"Just days before his inauguration,   Donald J. Trump stood beside his tax lawyer at a Midtown Manhattan news conference as she announced that he planned to place his vast business holdings in a trust, a move she said would allay fears that he might exploit the Oval Office for personal gain. However, a number of questions were left unanswered  —   including who would ultimately benefit from the trust  —   raising concerns about just how meaningful the move was. Now, records have emerged that show just how closely tied Mr. Trump remains to the empire he built. While the president says he has walked away from the    operations of his business, two people close to him are the named trustees and have broad legal authority over his assets: his eldest son, Donald Jr. and Allen H. Weisselberg, the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer. Mr. Trump, who will receive reports on any profit, or loss, on his company as a whole, can revoke their authority at any time. What’s more, the purpose of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust is to hold assets for the “exclusive benefit” of the president. This trust remains under Mr. Trump’s Social Security number, at least as far as federal taxes are concerned. Since his election, there have been widespread calls for Mr. Trump to sell his assets and put the proceeds in a blind trust. He has resisted those calls, stressing that the president has no legal obligation to do so. While the trust structure, outlined in documents made public through a Freedom of Information Act request by ProPublica, may give the president the appearance of distance from his business, it drew sharp criticism from experts in government ethics. “I don’t see how this in the slightest bit avoids a conflict of interest,” said Frederick J. Tansill, a trust and estates lawyer from Virginia who examined the documents at the request of The New York Times. “First it is revocable at any time, and it is his son and his chief financial officer who are running it. ” It is not uncommon for people to place assets in a trust with themselves as beneficiaries for   purposes. But Mr. Trump’s situation is unprecedented because it involves a wealthy president acting to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest. The Trump Organization declined to comment for this article. The most immediate test of Mr. Trump’s legal moves to separate himself from his company, the Trump Organization, pertains to the ownership of the new Trump International Hotel in the Old Post Office Building in Washington. The trust documents, which were prepared last month, argue that “all beneficial ownership in the licensee previously held by Donald J. Trump, personally, now is held derivatively and beneficially by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust,” which is legal language intended to suggest that Mr. Trump no longer has a personal tie to the hotel lease. A provision in the 2013 lease for the building, held by Mr. Trump and his three oldest children, appears to prohibit a federally elected official, including the president, from benefiting from it. But lawyers who specialize in federal contracts say the trust arrangement simply creates an additional legal step between Mr. Trump and the hotel  —   meaning he will still profit from it. Robert H. Sitkoff, a professor at Harvard Law School, said the new details in the trust documents were unlikely to resolve the apparent legal problems with the Old Post Office site. “Formally he is no longer the owner, but functionally he still is,” he said. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform who has called for a congressional investigation into the lease, said he remained unsatisfied that Mr. Trump had addressed his conflicts. “This is smoke and mirrors,” he said of the new documents. While Mr. Trump may have to take additional legal steps to avoid violating the terms of the Old Post Office lease, he is exempt from laws that prohibit federal employees from participating in government matters that will directly affect their own financial interests. At the Jan. 11 news conference in which she outlined the plans for Mr. Trump’s assets, Sheri A. Dillon, his tax lawyer, called the steps he had already taken significant, adding there was an agreement governing the president’s trust that “sharply” limited the amount of information about his company that he could access. “The   will have no role in deciding whether the Trump Organization engages in any new deal,” she said, “and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV. ” Ms. Dillon added that an asset sale by Mr. Trump would also be fraught with issues. “Whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny,” she said. “Was it too high? Is there pay for play? Was it too much pay to curry favor with the  ?” The Trump Organization, which is privately held, has also released a list of 488 Trump companies that Mr. Trump has held positions at, saying he resigned from all of them. Public records show that he has severed ties from some of these entities. The Trump Organization has pledged not to pursue new business deals overseas, though it plans to expand within the United States. Last month the company named Bobby Burchfield, a longtime Republican Party lawyer and corporate litigator, as an “independent ethics adviser. ” The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust has existed since at least 2014, records show. By 2016 it was the only shareholder in DJT Holdings, one of Mr. Trump’s main limited liability companies, according to documents filed by Mr. Trump as part of his bid for president and released by the Federal Election Commission. That company holds some of Mr. Trump’s largest assets, including his Old Post Office lease, golf courses and residential properties including a house in Beverly Hills, Calif. New York City property records show that in recent weeks Mr. Trump has transferred several residential condominiums he owns into the trust.",0
20593,20593,A Scholarly Sting Operation Shines a Light on ‘Predatory’ Journals - The New York Times,Gina Kolata,"The applicant’s nom de plume was not exactly subtle, if you know Polish. The middle initial and surname of the author, Anna O. Szust, mean “fraudster. ” Her publications were fake and her degrees were fake. The book chapters she listed among her publications could not be found, but perhaps that should not have been a surprise because the book publishers were fake, too. Yet, when Dr. Fraud applied to 360 randomly selected   academic journals asking to be an editor, 48 accepted her and four made her editor in chief. She got two offers to start a new journal and be its editor. One journal sent her an email saying, “It’s our pleasure to add your name as our editor in chief for the journal with no responsibilities. ” Little did they know that they had fallen for a sting, plotted and carried out by a group of researchers who wanted to draw attention to and systematically document the seamy side of   publishing. While those types of journals began with earnest aspirations to make scientific papers available to everyone, their proliferation has had unintended consequences. Traditional journals typically are supported by subscribers who pay a fee while authors pay nothing to be published. Nonsubscribers can only read papers if they pay the journal for each one they want to see.   journals reverse that model. The authors pay and the published papers are free to anyone who cares to read them. Publishing in an   journal can be expensive  —   the highly regarded Public Library of Science (PLOS) journals charge from $1, 495 to $2, 900 to publish a paper, with the fee dependent on which of its journals accepts the paper. Not everyone anticipated what would happen next, or to what extent it would happen. The   business model spawned a shadowy world of what have been called predatory journals. They may have similar names to legitimate journals, but exist by publishing just about anything sent to them for a fee that can range from under $100 to thousands of dollars. The fee often is between $100 and $400, said Jeffrey Beall, scholarly communications librarian at the University of Colorado, Denver, as the journals compete for paying customers. Of course, it is easier for predatory journals to have low fees because their expenses are minimal. The researchers decided not to list any of the fake journals that they uncovered in the sting, saying that some have names so close to those of legitimate journals that it would be confusing. There are now thousands of fake   journals, about as many as legitimate ones, according to one of the creators of Dr. Fraud, Katarzyna Pisanski, a researcher in the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex in England, and her colleagues. It was that alternate world that Dr. Fraud tapped into. The legitimate journals rejected her application out of hand, but many fake ones did not hesitate to take her on. The investigators, writing about their sting operation in Nature, said they had seen young colleagues fall for the blandishments of predatory journals, not realizing that the emails they received were from publications that only wanted their money. Dr. Pisanski and her colleagues wanted to help researchers understand how fake journals operated. “The emails can be very flattering,” Dr. Pisanski said, telling the recipients they are “eminent researchers” and “inviting” them to contribute. When researchers respond and send in papers, “they are published at lightning speed, often without peer review,” she said. But not everyone who publishes in these journals is an innocent dupe. Mr. Beall, who until recently published a list of predatory journals, said he believes many researchers know exactly what they are doing when they publish there. “I believe there are countless researchers and academics, currently employed, who have secured jobs, promotions, and tenure using publications in    journals as part of their credentials and experience for the jobs and promotions they got,” Mr. Beall said. And it can require real diligence on the part of employers to ferret out those questionable publications, Mr. Beall said. “Examining someone’s publications now requires close scrutiny,” Mr. Beall said. “Merely eyeballing a C. V. is insufficient now. ” David Knutson, the manager of communications at PLOS, said that young researchers may feel relentless pressure to publish, at all costs. “These authors are shopping around their papers,” he said. “There is so much pressure to publish. ” As for Dr. Fraud, she got some lucrative offers. One journal suggested she organize a conference, whose papers would then be published she would get 40 percent of the proceeds. Another invited her to start a new journal and offered her 30 percent of the profits. Dr. Pisanski and her colleagues told the journals that accepted Dr. Fraud that she wanted to withdraw her application to be an editor. But it was not easy to withdraw. Dr. Fraud remains listed as a member of the editorial boards of at least 11 of those journals. She is also listed as a member of   committees. At least one journal she did not apply to also listed her as an editor. And, Dr. Pisanski and her colleagues wrote, Dr. Fraud is even listed as an advisory board member of the Journals Open Access Indexing Committee. Its mission? To “increase the visibility and ease of use of   scholarly journals. ”",0
20594,20594,"Surging on the Riviera, With Mario Balotelli in Tow - The New York Times",Rory Smith,"NICE, France  —     Rivère accepts the compliment, but rejects the comparison. Rivère, the president of OGC Nice, can see why his team, this season, has been cast as France’s equivalent to Leicester City. He knows their stories follow the same arc: a provincial David defying overwhelming financial obstacles to outwit Goliath. He appreciates that the parallel is intended as praise, a convenient, flattering shorthand to explain the scale of Nice’s achievement in competing with Monaco and Paris   at the summit of France’s Ligue 1 over the last six months, maintaining a title challenge despite a budget that is a small fraction of its two bigger, richer rivals’. Sitting in an office at the back of Nice’s official club store, though, Rivère does not indulge the comparison for long. What Leicester did in winning the Premier League last season, he says, came from the realms of fantasy. It was an alignment of the stars, one that can no more be explained than it can be repeated. Nice, he is convinced, is different. If Leicester was a wonderful accident, Nice’s metamorphosis is entirely by design. From the outside, it is tempting  —   though misguided  —   to put a specific date on Nice’s ascendance: Aug. 31, 2016 (more on that below). In reality, the club has been growing, slowly and steadily, ever since Rivère, a real estate magnate, took control in 2011. When he arrived, he said, it was a “club with a bad reputation, without a strategy, a club in perdition. ” He has changed all of that. Nice moved into a new stadium, the     Allianz Riviera, in 2013. Rivère is overseeing the construction of a new training facility. He has even delivered on his promise to find outside investment, having sold 80 percent of the club to a consortium of Chinese and American investors. Results on the field have consistently improved, too, culminating in last season’s   finish under Coach Claude Puel. When Puel left last summer for Southampton  —   a more apposite English parallel for Nice  —   Rivère persuaded Lucien Favre, an astute Swiss coach who had led Borussia Mönchengladbach to the Champions League, to replace him. “Like Puel, he was not at the level of Nice when he arrived,” Rivère said. “He was much higher. ” The squad Favre inherited was one of youth and promise, yet he has lifted it to another plane despite a wide disparity in resources. Nice’s annual budget is $45 million. Monaco’s is three times that, and P. S. G. ’s more than 10 times as large. Nice, though, has led the league for much of the season. A place in the Champions League next season now looks like the least of its ambitions. The spotlight, though, always prefers to fixate on hares, rather than tortoises. It was only on Aug. 31, when Rivère confirmed the arrival of Mario Balotelli, the enigmatic,   Italian striker, that the rest of the world sat up and took notice of what was happening on the Riviera. The year before, Nice had signed an equally tempestuous character, the France winger Hatem Ben Arfa. The move piqued interest in France, and a degree of curiosity from the rest of Europe. Balotelli was another order of magnitude. Dozens of reporters descended on the Riviera. L’Équipe, the French sports daily, devoted five pages to the signing. Nice’s name flashed around the planet. “With Ben Arfa, it was Europe,” Rivère said. “With Balotelli, it was the world. ” Much of the coverage, naturally, centered on Balotelli’s reputation, his truculence and his rebelliousness. Many felt that Nice  —   like Liverpool, Milan and Manchester City before it  —   would struggle to control Balotelli, to restore his focus. The move was dismissed, in some quarters, as a publicity stunt. Rivère was more confident. “I do not often do this,” he said, “but I looked at everything that had been said about him. I asked to see the videos of his matches, the good and the bad. I saw 20 bad things and just one good thing. “One day, after training at Manchester City, he met a small boy. He asked him what he was doing there, and the boy said he did not want to go to school, because he had been bullied. So Balotelli took the boy to school in his car, so the boy could feel like a star, and sorted out the problem. I said that if he had done this, he must have a good heart. ” Rivère has been proved right: Working to a customized training plan, Balotelli has thrived, emerging as a central plank of Nice’s title challenge. He has scored 11 goals in 18 games though there have been controversies, they have happened to him, rather than because of him: a red card that was later rescinded, and racial abuse directed toward him during a game at Bastia. “When a player arrives, I guarantee only one thing: that if they come to play here, they will find a family club, a good atmosphere, a good group,” Rivère said. “They will find a smile. “When you have a player who is in trouble, the problem is often in the head, not the feet,” he continued. “If you had talent in the past and lost it, with us you have more chance of rediscovering the pleasure of playing football. ” That is not to say Rivère is running some sort of corrective institution for the chronically wayward. Nice benefits from Balotelli just as much as he benefits from Nice, if not more on the field, of course, but off it, too. Rivère referred to the Italian as a marketing “accelerator. ” That is particularly important as the club tries to grow. Nice is one of the oldest soccer teams in France, and one of the proudest, too: It is the only French club with its own anthem  —   “Nissa la Bella,” or “Beautiful Nice,” in Niçois dialect. When its new stadium opened, Nice arranged for the turf from the center circle at its old home, the Stade du Ray, to be laid into the field, a symbolic gesture by club officials to worried fans that though the location had changed, Nice’s heart remained the same. And yet the city seems too genteel, too well heeled, to feel as   as Marseille, for example, a couple of hours down the Côte d’Azur. Soccer tends to thrive where it is the single unifying factor at first glance, that is not the case in Nice. The mountains are an hour away, Monte Carlo even less. There are beaches and nightclubs, money and glamour. All act as competition. So signing Balotelli was not just a way to garner international attention, but another effort to draw fans away from the various other delights of the area and into the stadium. “We try to make matches a complete experience,” Rivère said. He has always demanded that the style of play be “popular,” appealing. The club regularly hands out free tickets to local children, and it has refitted all of its V. I. P. areas some do not close until the small hours of the morning. There was even an ice rink installed outside the Allianz Riviera before Christmas. It would be unfair to dismiss all of those initiatives as gimmickry, an artificial imposition of a soccer culture. Beneath the surface, the bond between this city and this club is strong. At the start of the Promenade des Anglais, in the heart of the city, is a memorial to the 86 people killed in the Bastille Day terror attack last year. It is an impossibly moving sight: a bandstand awash with thousands of teddy bears left to commemorate the dead, poems written in their honor, flags, stones, candles and messages of condolence. Rival fans have made pilgrimages here, during the season, to pay their respects: a Montpellier pennant, a Lens jersey, a scarf from F. C. Krasnodar, a Russian team, all nestle among the tributes. And everywhere, there are flashes of red and black, OGC Nice’s colors, the team’s identity acting as a surrogate for that of the city. It is a role that Rivère, and the club as a whole, feel keenly. OGC Nice has helped raise hundreds of thousands of euros for the families of the victims. In the 86th minute of every home game, it remembers those who were murdered. It would be glib to say the tragedy has helped inspire Nice’s success this season nobody at the club would make that claim. But they know that such events cannot only put soccer into perspective but, in the aftermath, also lend it a greater significance. This year they have a greater responsibility and, as they write this latest chapter on their fastidiously planned journey, an opportunity for a greater impact, too. “What happened on July 14 wounded every citizen of Nice,” Rivère said. “It gives us even more willingness to succeed. We are like a medicine, for those who love football. The day of the match, the day after, we help people to forget. ”",0
20595,20595,Donald Trump Seizes on Orlando Shooting and Repeats Call for Temporary Ban on Muslim Migration - The New York Times,Jonathan Martin,"WASHINGTON  —   Donald J. Trump on Sunday sought to capitalize on the mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, reiterating his controversial call for a temporary ban on Muslim migration to the United States and criticizing Hillary Clinton for what he claimed was her desire to “dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East. ” In a demonstration of his willingness to flout convention and engage in a style of demagogic politics rarely displayed by a presidential nominee, Mr. Trump claimed he had warned of the sort of terrorism that marked the shooting, which killed 50 and was the worst in the country’s history. “I said this was going to happen  —   and it is only going to get worse,” Mr. Trump said in a statement, arguing that Mrs. Clinton’s presidency would mean “hundreds of thousands” more Middle East migrants. “And we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing,” said Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican  . The suspected gunman, Omar Mateen, was an American who declared allegiance to the Islamic State and was the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan. Mr. Trump extended his opprobrium to that   heavily Muslim country by noting the wide support there for Shariah law. In a separate statement on Twitter, Mr. Trump said that the rampage in Orlando “is just the beginning” and noted that he “asked for the ban” on Muslim immigration to America. He has made his hard line against Muslims central to his campaign, and, even after becoming the presumptive nominee and turning to a broader electorate, refused to fully back off from his call to temporarily halt Muslims from traveling to America. Mr. Trump has faced widespread condemnation for this stance from both Mrs. Clinton and numerous Republicans, but, as he did again Sunday, he has said such vigilance was necessary and that the country “can’t afford to be politically correct. ” To this end, he said Mrs. Clinton should quit the presidential race if she proved unwilling to acknowledge that the attack in Orlando was the result of “two words: radical Islam. ” Mrs. Clinton did not use that phrase or respond directly to Mr. Trump’s broadsides. Her campaign instead sought to use the event to diminish their Republican rival. “This act of terror is the largest mass shooting in American history and a tragedy that requires a serious response,” Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton’s communications director said, adding that: “Donald Trump put out political attacks, weak platitudes and  . ” Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, initially responded with caution Sunday morning after early reports about the assault, offering her thoughts to those affected “as we wait for more information. ” But after President Obama spoke in the afternoon, and called the Orlando killings an “act of terror,” she issued a longer statement echoing the president. “This was an act of terror,” Mrs. Clinton said. In her statement, Mrs. Clinton said “we need to redouble our efforts to defend our country from threats at home and abroad,” focusing on the threat of terrorism. Further down in her statement, she called for more stringent restrictions on guns. “Finally, we need to keep guns like the ones used last night out of the hands of terrorists or other violent criminals,” she said, taking up the call many on the left made in the hours after the attack. Mr. Trump, who made no mention of access to firearms in any of his comments, said Mr. Obama should resign for his own refusal to say “radical Islam. ” The White House declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s demand for the president’s resignation. A tragedy in the middle of a presidential race would typically force restraint on candidates. But this tradition has largely vanished in the era of the superheated, social media news cycle, where mass shootings immediately set off debates about access to guns and, if the perpetrator is Muslim, Islamist terrorism. And if the Orlando massacre was a test of how willing candidates and their supporters are to pursue partisan attacks in the aftermath of horrific violence, Mr. Trump left little doubt about his willingness to push the boundaries of the country’s public discourse. He had no public events Sunday and, in a rarity, did not appear on any of the weekly political talk shows. But he made ample use of his Twitter account, where he said: “appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism. ” It was a vivid illustration of how little heed Mr. Trump pays to traditional political standards, whether it is on how campaigns are waged or on the kinds of positions he embraces. But there were few Republicans criticizing him for his Muslim ban proposal on Sunday. Mr. Trump had planned a speech on Monday in New Hampshire focused on what he sees as the Clintons’ ethical lapses. But he indicated in his statement on Sunday that he would use the appearance to “further address this terrorist attack, immigration, and national security. ” If Mr. Trump was characteristically bellicose in his response, Mrs. Clinton was typically restrained. She used her statement to make clear she recognized that the country had suffered yet another act of terrorism, but also made sure to offer her solidarity with the gay community and reiterate her support for gun control. She was also off the campaign trail for the day, but avoided Twitter blasts and refrained from making any extended public comment until after the president delivered his remarks in the White House briefing room. Mrs. Clinton was also planning to give remarks Monday lacerating her rival. She had planned to speak about what she deems as Mr. Trump’s dangerous demagogy at an appearance in Ohio. It is unclear whether Mrs. Clinton will use her speech to forcefully confront Mr. Trump. Mrs. Palmieri, the campaign aide, said Mrs. Clinton would discuss “steps she would take to keep the country safe” in the coming days and another aide said the candidate intended to refashion her address Monday to focus on the terrorism in Orlando. What is clear is that the shooting will reorient the race for at least the next week. Mrs. Clinton was to have held a campaign rally with Mr. Obama in Green Bay, Wis. on Wednesday, her first joint appearance with the president. But she quickly postponed the event on Sunday after the severity of the shooting became clear.",0
20596,20596,President Putin Meeting of the Valdai International Discussion Club | The Vineyard of the Saker,nan,"
Vladimir Putin took part in the final session of the Valdai International Discussion Club’ s 13th annual meeting, which this year took the theme The Future in Progress: Shaping the World of Tomorrow . 
Over the three-day event, 130 experts and political analysts from 35 countries examined current issues concerning development of international relations, internal political organisation, the economy, demography, and technology. 
The participants looked, in particular, at ways to mitigate the consequences of radical changes on the global political map and the crisis in democratic systems and their work, and discussed development roads for Russia-EU relations and what the global system might look like in 10 years’ time. 
The final session was also attended by former President of Finland Tarja Halonen, former President of Austria Heinz Fischer, and former President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki. 
* * * 
President of Russia Vladimir Putin : Tarja, Heinz, Thabo, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, 
It is a great pleasure to see you again. I want to start by thanking all of the participants in the Valdai International Discussion Club, from Russia and abroad, for your constructive part in this work, and I want to thank our distinguished guests for their readiness to take part in this open discussion. 
Our esteemed moderator just wished me a good departure into retirement, and I wish myself the same when the time comes. This is the right approach and the thing to do. But I am not retired yet and am for now the leader of this big country. As such, it is fitting to show restraint and avoid displays of excessive aggressiveness. I do not think that this is my style in any case. 
But I do think that we should be frank with each other, particularly here in this gathering. I think we should hold candid, open discussions, otherwise our dialogue makes no sense and would be insipid and without the slightest interest. 
I think that this style of discussion is extremely needed today given the great changes taking place in the world. The theme for our meeting this year, The Future in Progress: Shaping the World of Tomorrow , is very topical. 
Last year, the Valdai forum participants discussed the problems with the current world order. Unfortunately, little has changed for the better over these last months. Indeed, it would be more honest to say that nothing has changed. 
The tensions engendered by shifts in distribution of economic and political influence continue to grow. Mutual distrust creates a burden that narrows our possibilities for finding effective responses to the real threats and challenges facing the world today. Essentially, the entire globalisation project is in crisis today and in Europe, as we know well, we hear voices now saying that multiculturalism has failed. 
I think this situation is in many respects the result of mistaken, hasty and to some extent over-confident choices made by some countries’ elites a quarter-of-a-century ago. Back then, in the late 1980s-early 1990s, there was a chance not just to accelerate the globalisation process but also to give it a different quality and make it more harmonious and sustainable in nature. 
But some countries that saw themselves as victors in the Cold War, not just saw themselves this way but said it openly, took the course of simply reshaping the global political and economic order to fit their own interests. 
In their euphoria, they essentially abandoned substantive and equal dialogue with other actors in international life, chose not to improve or create universal institutions, and attempted instead to bring the entire world under the spread of their own organisations, norms and rules. They chose the road of globalisation and security for their own beloved selves, for the select few, and not for all. But far from everyone was ready to agree with this. 
We may as well be frank here, as we know full well that many did not agree with what was happening, but some were unable by then to respond, and others were not yet ready to respond. The result though is that the system of international relations is in a feverish state and the global economy cannot extricate itself from systemic crisis. At the same time, rules and principles, in the economy and in politics, are constantly being distorted and we often see what only yesterday was taken as a truth and raised to dogma status reversed completely. 
If the powers that be today find some standard or norm to their advantage, they force everyone else to comply. But if tomorrow these same standards get in their way, they are swift to throw them in the bin, declare them obsolete, and set or try to set new rules. 
Thus, we saw the decisions to launch airstrikes in the centre of Europe, against Belgrade, and then came Iraq, and then Libya. The operations in Afghanistan also started without the corresponding decision from the United Nations Security Council. In their desire to shift the strategic balance in their favour these countries broke apart the international legal framework that prohibited deployment of new missile defence systems. They created and armed terrorist groups, whose cruel actions have sent millions of civilians into flight, made millions of displaced persons and immigrants, and plunged entire regions into chaos. 
We see how free trade is being sacrificed and countries use sanctions as a means of political pressure, bypass the World Trade Organisation and attempt to establish closed economic alliances with strict rules and barriers, in which the main beneficiaries are their own transnational corporations. And we know this is happening. They see that they cannot resolve all of the problems within the WTO framework and so think, why not throw the rules and the organisation itself aside and build a new one instead. This illustrates what I just said. 
At the same time, some of our partners demonstrate no desire to resolve the real international problems in the world today. In organisations such as NATO, for example, established during the Cold War and clearly out of date today, despite all the talk about the need to adapt to the new reality, no real adaptation takes place. We see constant attempts to turn the OSCE, a crucial mechanism for ensuring common European and also trans-Atlantic security, into an instrument in the service of someone’s foreign policy interests. The result is that this very important organisation has been hollowed out. 
But they continue to churn out threats, imaginary and mythical threats such as the ‘Russian military threat’. This is a profitable business that can be used to pump new money into defence budgets at home, get allies to bend to a single superpower’s interests, expand NATO and bring its infrastructure, military units and arms closer to our borders. 
Of course, it can be a pleasing and even profitable task to portray oneself as the defender of civilisation against the new barbarians. The only thing is that Russia has no intention of attacking anyone. This is all quite absurd. I also read analytical materials, those written by you here today, and by your colleagues in the USA and Europe. 
It is unthinkable, foolish and completely unrealistic. Europe alone has 300 million people. All of the NATO members together with the USA have a total population of 600 million, probably. But Russia has only 146 million. It is simply absurd to even conceive such thoughts. And yet they use these ideas in pursuit of their political aims. 
Another mythical and imaginary problem is what I can only call the hysteria the USA has whipped up over supposed Russian meddling in the American presidential election. The United States has plenty of genuinely urgent problems, it would seem, from the colossal public debt to the increase in firearms violence and cases of arbitrary action by the police. 
You would think that the election debates would concentrate on these and other unresolved problems, but the elite has nothing with which to reassure society, it seems, and therefore attempt to distract public attention by pointing instead to supposed Russian hackers, spies, agents of influence and so forth. 
I have to ask myself and ask you too: Does anyone seriously imagine that Russia can somehow influence the American people’s choice? America is not some kind of ‘banana republic’, after all, but is a great power. Do correct me if I am wrong. 
The question is, if things continue in this vein, what awaits the world? What kind of world will we have tomorrow? Do we have answers to the questions of how to ensure stability, security and sustainable economic growth? Do we know how we will make a more prosperous world? 
Sad as it is to say, there is no consensus on these issues in the world today. Maybe you have come to some common conclusions through your discussions, and I would, of course, be interested to hear them. But it is very clear that there is a lack of strategy and ideas for the future. This creates a climate of uncertainty that has a direct impact on the public mood. 
Sociological studies conducted around the world show that people in different countries and on different continents tend to see the future as murky and bleak. This is sad. The future does not entice them, but frightens them. At the same time, people see no real opportunities or means for changing anything, influencing events and shaping policy. 
Yes, formally speaking, modern countries have all the attributes of democracy: Elections, freedom of speech, access to information, freedom of expression. But even in the most advanced democracies the majority of citizens have no real influence on the political process and no direct and real influence on power. 
People sense an ever-growing gap between their interests and the elite’s vision of the only correct course, a course the elite itself chooses. The result is that referendums and elections increasingly often create surprises for the authorities. People do not at all vote as the official and respectable media outlets advised them to, nor as the mainstream parties advised them to. Public movements that only recently were too far left or too far right are taking centre stage and pushing the political heavyweights aside. 
At first, these inconvenient results were hastily declared anomaly or chance. But when they became more frequent, people started saying that society does not understand those at the summit of power and has not yet matured sufficiently to be able to assess the authorities’ labour for the public good. Or they sink into hysteria and declare it the result of foreign, usually Russian, propaganda. 
Friends and colleagues, I would like to have such a propaganda machine here in Russia, but regrettably, this is not the case. We have not even global mass media outlets of the likes of CNN, BBC and others. We simply do not have this kind of capability yet. 
As for the claim that the fringe and populists have defeated the sensible, sober and responsible minority – we are not talking about populists or anything like that but about ordinary people, ordinary citizens who are losing trust in the ruling class. That is the problem. 
By the way, with the political agenda already eviscerated as it is, and with elections ceasing to be an instrument for change but consisting instead of nothing but scandals and digging up dirt – who gave someone a pinch, who sleeps with whom, if you’ll excuse me. This just goes beyond all boundaries. And honestly, a look at various candidates’ platforms gives the impression that they were made from the same mould – the difference is slight, if there is any. 
It seems as if the elites do not see the deepening stratification in society and the erosion of the middle class, while at the same time, they implant ideological ideas that, in my opinion, are destructive to cultural and national identity. And in certain cases, in some countries they subvert national interests and renounce sovereignty in exchange for the favour of the suzerain. 
This begs the question: who is actually the fringe? The expanding class of the supranational oligarchy and bureaucracy, which is in fact often not elected and not controlled by society, or the majority of citizens, who want simple and plain things – stability, free development of their countries, prospects for their lives and the lives of their children, preserving their cultural identity, and, finally, basic security for themselves and their loved ones. 
People are clearly scared to see how terrorism is evolving from a distant threat to an everyday one, how a terrorist attack could occur right near them, on the next street, if not on their own street, while any makeshift item – from a home-made explosive to an ordinary truck – can be used to carry out a mass killing. 
Moreover, the terrorist attacks that have taken place in the past few years in Boston and other US cities, Paris, Brussels, Nice and German cities, as well as, sadly, in our own country, show that terrorists do not need units or organised structures – they can act independently, on their own, they just need the ideological motivation against their enemies, that is, against you and us. 
The terrorist threat is a clear example of how people fail to adequately evaluate the nature and causes of the growing threats. We see this in the way events in Syria are developing. No one has succeeded in stopping the bloodshed and launching a political settlement process. One would think that we would have begun to put together a common front against terrorism now, after such lengthy negotiations, enormous effort and difficult compromises. 
But this has not happened and this common front has not emerged. My personal agreements with the President of the United States have not produced results either. There were people in Washington ready to do everything possible to prevent these agreements from being implemented in practice. This all demonstrates an unexplainable and I would say irrational desire on the part of the Western countries to keep making the same mistakes or, as we say here in Russia, keep stepping on the same rake. 
We all see what is happening in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and a number of other countries. I have to ask, where are the results of the fight against terrorism and extremism? Overall, looking at the world as a whole, there are some results in particular regions and locations, but there is no global result and the terrorist threat continues to grow. 
We all remember the euphoria in some capitals over the Arab Spring. Where are these fanfares today? Russia’s calls for a joint fight against terrorism go ignored. What’s more, they continue to arm, supply and train terrorist groups in the hope of using them to achieve their own political aims. This is a very dangerous game and I address the players once again: The extremists in this case are more cunning, clever and stronger than you, and if you play these games with them, you will always lose. 
Colleagues, it is clear that the international community should concentrate on the real problems facing humanity today, the resolution of which will make our world a safer and more stable place and make the system of international relations fairer and more equal. As I said, it is essential to transform globalisation from something for a select few into something for all. It is my firm belief that we can overcome these threats and challenges only by working together on the solid foundation of international law and the United Nations Charter. 
Today it is the United Nations that continues to remain an agency that is unparalleled in representativeness and universality, a unique venue for equitable dialogue. Its universal rules are necessary for including as many countries as possible in economic and humanitarian integration, guaranteeing their political responsibility and working to coordinate their actions while also preserving their sovereignty and development models. 
We have no doubt that sovereignty is the central notion of the entire system of international relations. Respect for it and its consolidation will help underwrite peace and stability both at the national and international levels. There are many countries that can rely on a history stretching back a thousand years, like Russia, and we have come to appreciate our identity, freedom and independence. But we do not seek global domination, expansion or confrontation with anyone. 
In our mind, real leadership lies in seeing real problems rather than attempting to invent mythical threats and use them to steamroll others. This is exactly how Russia understands its role in global affairs today. 
There are priorities without which a prosperous future for our shared planet is unthinkable and they are absolutely obvious. I won’t be saying anything new here. First of all, there is equal and indivisible security for all states. Only after ending armed conflicts and ensuring the peaceful development of all countries will we be able to talk about economic progress and the resolution of social, humanitarian and other key problems. It is important to fight terrorism and extremism in actuality. It has been said more than once that this evil can only be overcome by a concerted effort of all states of the world. Russia continues to offer this to all interested partners.

20597,20597,"Sorry, Ms. Jackson: You’re Underrated. ‘Control’ at 30 - The New York Times",Wesley Morris,"The standard for   artistic statements in pop music is now so high that you need a pilot’s license to compete with the Beyoncés, Kanyes and Kendricks of the world. But when Janet Jackson craved ascent, she didn’t go to flight school. She went to Flyte Tyme. That was the Minneapolis production company Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis operated and where the three came up with “Control,” Ms. Jackson’s third record and the first of their subtly strange, sonically complex thematic carnivals. The album turned 30 in February, peaked in popularity right about this time that year (hitting No. 1 in July) and still sounds today as much like 1986 as it does 2056. Some producers make hooks. These three made wedgies. “Control” is a work of confidence, cleverness and justifiable irritation. It’s also full of weird, amazing sounds that, 30 years later, it’s easy to take for granted as the way   pop music has always been: polished in a factory to a gemlike gleam. But most of the nine songs on this album  —   nine songs!  —   weren’t just   they were performed by almost entirely aggressive, attitudinal heavy machinery that was new for both Top 40 and the outer limits of mainstream RB. Meanwhile, for any number of reasons (that Super Bowl scandal, the long shadow of other stars, our cultural amnesia) the woman behind the wheel has been demoted to the back seat. And that, of course, warrants a correction. Ms. Jackson was around 20 when she entered the recording studio after a stint as a sitcom star (poor Penny on “Good Times,” richer Charlene on “Diff’rent Strokes”) an annulled marriage and a split from her notoriously oppressive father, Joe. So a decree was in order: “When it’s got to do with my   want to be the one in control. ” That’s from the opening song, “Control,” which begins with a spoken proclamation of  : “This is a story about control. ” Jimmy Jam and Mr. Lewis orbited Prince, and that opening has always sounded like a counterpoint to the mania of “Let’s Go Crazy,” which had just completed devouring America the year before. In the face of collapse, Prince demanded chaos. Ms. Jackson’s idea of anarchy was, well, control. In the middle of the title track, Ms. Jackson sings, “First time I fell in   didn’t know what hit me,” and you can hear a car screeching into a collision. The next song starts with a demand: “Gimme a beat!” And the beat she gets is like no beat you’ve heard. It’s a bunch of drums punching themselves silly, then five notes of metallic, pipelike noise, joined by a strange, constant click. This is “Nasty,” and its violence is delicious. If the song has one climax, it must have four. Here was America’s Penny sounding like the proudly nasty funk artist Millie Jackson (no relation not biologically, anyway). The song is part antichauvinist call to arms, part street fight, part “had it up to here” exasperation, part wink  —   each a mood Ms. Jackson would deploy for most of her career. That constant click starts to make a lot of sense. It’s the first No. 3 hit built around the sucking of teeth. For two happy weeks, my favorite song on “Control” was also America’s. “When I Think of You” hit No. 1 in October 1986, but it began its hike toward the top in July and sounds the most like summer. It’s wearing the lightest clothes of any of the tracks and it dons them very slowly: first a plink of keyboard, then some jabs of bass, drums and percussion, hopscotching vibes, and, finally, a blast of artificial horns that sound an alarm that Ms. Jackson is going to do some of her prettiest singing. Hearing her here is like being able to see the seafloor from the shore. Ms. Jackson has a soufflé of a voice  —   thin, delicate, pleasurably sweet. Sometimes she, Jimmy Jam and Mr. Lewis could bury it with layers of sound, but not here. After about three minutes and 18 seconds of straightforward, daydreaming pop, she says, “Break,” and the bottom falls out, leaving just the keyboard and percussion, and a new, primal energy takes over. Then the bass reappears, some chanting builds to a squawking wail, the music explodes, and Ms. Jackson laughs and sings, “Feels so   I think of you. ” Seconds later, the song’s over. So what’s it about? “You,” but probably what Ms. Jackson does when she, uh, thinks of you. It makes sense to admire “Control” as an album about independence. It’s a compelling tale of freedom in which Ms. Jackson liberates herself from the demands of suffocating men to make her own demands. She granted herself permission to define her sexiness. Even now, the excitement of “When I Think of You” is the sight of a cherubic Janet Jackson   across a soundstage in a silky,   jacket and bustier, matching pants, heels, that hoop earring with the key on it, and the mane of three lions. That was also the summer of Madonna’s “Open Your Heart” video, in which she seduced with just the bustier, some fishnets and a peep show. Despite, or more likely because of, all those clothes, Ms. Jackson’s dancing seemed all the freer. One reason to revisit “Control,” aside from its general excellence and a milestone anniversary, is to consider Ms. Jackson’s value as a pop artist, which doesn’t happen often enough. Her most recent album, “Unbreakable,” hit No. 1 last fall, but the gleam of her stardom never recovered from that evening in 2004 when Justin Timberlake ripped open her costume, exposing her breast at the Super Bowl. The logistics and intent of the moment are still ambiguous Ms. Jackson publicly apologized. It didn’t matter. The stain had set. She went from a steady maker of big hits to some kind of postlapsarian   seemingly overnight. But it still feels less like she’s fallen and more like she was pushed. The album she released soon after the Super Bowl, “Damita Jo,” remains underrated as a result. But so does Ms. Jackson, who’s made several great records, including “The Velvet Rope” (1997) and “All for You” (2001). The punitive racial and gender politics of the halftime show partially explain her diminishment. She’s spent the latter part of her career as a vital member of Tyler Perry’s movie troupe and opted for more discreet attire than she used to. Another explanation is that her natural demureness and inclination toward privacy have made her seem more reclusive in a   age in which an artist like Madonna  —   or her and Ms. Jackson’s proliferating progeny  —   seems more omnipresent. Really, though, the narrative history of popular music tends to narrow with distance, regardless of how many tens of millions of albums you’ve sold or how vertiginous your fame. We often think of pop’s top echelon in terms of Prince, Madonna and Ms. Jackson’s brother, Michael, each of whom tends to overshadow what makes Ms. Jackson crucial. For one thing, she was as necessary as Michael Jackson and Prince for the integration of MTV. And she should have been: She was the superior   artist. Only Madonna was keener about the power of  . Ms. Jackson’s hits might be less distinctive, too, in collective hindsight. I rarely hear her at parties, even at nostalgic ones. There is, apparently, no “1999,” “Holiday” or “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’” in her trove. It could just be that for a song as fed up as “What Have You Done for Me Lately” or as fun to sing along to as “Escapade,” from “Rhythm Nation 1814” (1989) the music might just be too quirky to lure you to the dance floor. So say certain D. J. s and   algorithms, anyway. Eventually, Ms. Jackson made blackness an important part of her music and presence, too. Her “Janet. ” album (1993) includes a song with Chuck D called “New Agenda,” in which she denounces racism and declares that, as an   woman, “I stand tall with pride. ” When “Control” reached the top of the Billboard 200, the second and third positions were held by Patti LaBelle and Whitney Houston. And Tina Turner had just mounted a legendary second act as a solo artist. America seemed O. K. with black women dominating different areas of pop music. Ms. Jackson just inserted politics. She recorded “New Agenda” the year after the Rodney King beating and the riots that followed. The only difference between then and now is that Ms. Jackson would have built a concept video around the song and put it on HBO. As it is, the premiere of her   “Rhythm Nation” video was pretty much the “Lemonade” of its day. Thirty years of “Control” is a useful, if contrived, excuse to argue for Ms. Jackson’s necessity, especially as someone who knew the power of an image. Take that hoop earring with the key. It was as iconic as L L Cool J’s Kangols, George Michael’s stubble and Steven Tyler’s scarves. It was the perfect symbol for both a project called “Control” and a woman whose guard has gone down and up over the decades. People thought that key was a potential invitation, something sexy. But what if it was just  ? What if she was never looking for someone to give it to? What if she was her own lock?",0

[Roseann Sdoia, a Boston native who was a spectator near the finish line of the race in 2013, was hit by shrapnel from the second bomb that exploded, the Daily Mail reported.  Firefighter Mike Materia stepped in to save Sdoia’s life by using a belt as a makeshift tourniquet, and he held her hand as she was rushed to the hospital. While at the hospital, Sdoia’s mother tried to set him up with her. “In the hospital, my mom tried to set me up with him,” Sdoia told the New York Post. “She was like, ‘Oh, did you see that firefighter? He’s so cute.’ And I was like, ‘Mom, I just got blown up. ’” Sdoia’s leg required amputation, and Materia was there by her side throughout the recovery process. “I do feel that, in a sense, some things happen for a reason,” Sdoia said. The couple went on their first date in June 2013, and Materia proposed to Sdoia in December. He put a special engraved dog tag on their dog Sal, saying “Mike wants to know  …     If you’ll marry him. ” The couple plans to have a small wedding in October or November.

Williams, Ph.D.","In a video message to young Catholics throughout the world, Pope Francis proposed the Virgin Mary as a model of active Christian discipleship, noting that she was no passive “couch potato. ”[The Vatican released the video message on Tuesday in preparation for the next World Youth Day, to be held in Panama in 2019.  The Virgin Mary, Francis said, “encourages us with her faith,” when she acknowledged that the “Mighty One has done great things for me. ” She also “knew how to give thanks to God who looked upon her littleness,” he said, and “recognised the great things that God was accomplishing in her life. ” Importantly, the Pope noted, Mary did not sit by idly but “set off to visit her cousin Elizabeth who was old and needed her to be close by. ” “Mary did not stay at home because she was not a young couch potato who looks for comfort and safety where nobody can bother them,” Francis said. “She was moved by faith because faith is at the heart of Our Mother’s entire life story. ” In his message, the Pope told young people that God is watching over and calling them, looking at all the love they are able to offer. “Like the young woman of Nazareth,” he said, “you can improve the world and leave an imprint that makes a mark on history —  your history and that of many others. ” “The Church and society need you,” he added. “With your plans and with your courage, with your dreams and ideals, walls of stagnation fall and roads open up that lead us to a better, fairer, less cruel and more humane world. ” The Pope also encouraged young people to cultivate a relationship of familiarity and friendship with Mary as “our Mother,” urging them to speak to her “as you would to a Mother. ” “Together with her,” he said, “give thanks for the precious gift of faith that you have received from your elders, and entrust your whole life to her. She is a good Mother who listens to you and embraces you, who loves you and walks together with you. ” “I assure you that if you do that, you will not regret it,” he said. Follow Thomas D.

20600,20600,Trump’s Child Rape Victim Just Canceled Press Conference Over Death Threats,Colin Taylor,"Comments 
The woman accusing Trump of raping her when she was just thirteen years old at one of convicted pedophile Jeffery Epstein’s notorious underage sex parties was all set to come forward tonight to tell her story – but backed out at the last moment, saying that she had “received threats” and feared for her life. Lisa Bloom just said her client was “living in fear” and did not want to show her face and ended the press conference. 
— Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) November 2, 2016 
The pressures that face the female accusers of powerful white men couldn’t be more clear right now. One of Trump’s sexual assault accusers has already fled the country due to threats from his rabid supporters.“ We feel the backlash of the Trump supporters. It scares us. It intimidates us. We are in fear of our lives,” said Mindy McGillivray, who said Trump groped her at a party. “I look out the window and there are cars just driving around the house and looking, slowing down right at the house. I don’t live in a gated community. This is dangerous. There could be people out there who want to hurt us.’’ 
The pressure to stay silent comes just as strong from the Trump camp itself – just look at how Michael Cohen, special counsel for the Trump Organization, responded to Daily Beast when they called asking for comment on a story about how Trump raped then-wife Ivana Trump in a painful and brutal fashion: 
I will make sure that you and I meet one day while we’re in the courthouse. And I will take you for every penny you still don’t have. And I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know. So I’m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I’m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting. You understand me?” 
“You write a story that has Mr. Trump’s name in it, with the word ‘rape,’ and I’m going to mess your life up… for as long as you’re on this frickin’ planet… you’re going to have judgments against you, so much money, you’ll never know how to get out from underneath it.’ 
Which begs the question, why so defensive if there is nothing to hide, Mr. Trump? 
Donald Trump’s followers are some of the lowest, most hateful scum to ever tarnish American soil. Klansmen, neo-Nazis, white supremacists. They send death threats to anyone who dares to speak out against him – if you’re lucky. You could receive horrifying, personalized attacks like a Jewish writer for the National Review did: 
Given the ease with which Trump supporters will bring violence on the innocent , it is no wonder that these women are reluctant to come forward. This is the culture of fear that Donald Trump has created – and one which will consume our whole nation if we somehow let him become President.

20601,20601,"Review: In ‘Little Men,’ Boys Develop a Bond That Is Threatened by Money - The New York Times",A. O. Scott,"There is hardly a shortage of buddy movies about mismatched men bonding under duress, but films that chart the emotional weather of everyday male friendship are rare. Literature has more to offer, at least as far as boys are concerned. Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn have a rich and renewable legacy. And it may be that association that imparts a novelistic vibe to Ira Sachs’s “Little Men,” beyond the Louisa May Alcott echo in the title. It’s a subtle movie, alert to the almost imperceptible currents of feeling that pass between its title characters. They are Jake Jardine (Theo Taplitz) and Tony Calvelli (Michael Barbieri) two middle schoolers who cross paths in Brooklyn. I almost ended that sentence “and fall in love,” a possibly misleading but not at all inaccurate account of what happens. The childhood bond that the psychologist Harry Stack Sullivan called “chumship” can be as intense and mysterious as romantic love, and can be sparked by the kind of intuitive connection that arises between Jake and Tony when they first meet. Jake, pale and reserved, is an exile from Manhattan, flung across the East River by the tides of family fortune. His father, Brian (Greg Kinnear) might be described as a struggling actor if it didn’t seem that the fight had mostly gone out of him. He works, but he mostly worries, tries to be a nice guy and feels guilty when he fails at it. Jake’s mother, Kathy (Jennifer Ehle) who is a bit more decisive, is a therapist, and her smiling demeanor acts as a shield against the unspoken tensions hovering in the air whenever she and her husband are together. The family moves into an apartment that used to belong to Brian’s father, whose death is the movie’s precipitating catastrophe. The old man also owned the building where Tony’s mother, Leonor (Paulina García) runs a dress shop, and if “Little Men” is a love story it is also a tale of economic conflict in a rapidly changing city, a fable about the insidious, toxic power of money and real estate. Jake’s grandfather is recalled as a   bohemian of the kind that used to be more plentiful in New York. “He loved me,” Leonor says, perhaps hinting that they were lovers but more pointedly explaining why he charged her so little rent. Brian, urged on by his sister, wants to raise it. As the dispute between them escalates, it casts a shadow over Jake’s relationship with Tony. All the   think they are being perfectly reasonable as they dig in their heels and allow a business matter to turn into a personal grudge. None of them can help it everyone needs money. Their behavior  —   the politesse that grows increasingly cold, the contempt that seethes among people who believe themselves to be not only right but righteous  —   is dismaying, but hardly surprising. It’s also not really the point. Mr. Sachs holds the adults at arm’s length, declining either to judge them too harshly for their selfishness or to extend them more than minimal sympathy for their difficulties. In other words, “Little Men” is on the side of Jake and Tony, as both a narrative strategy and a moral choice. Their temperaments and backgrounds are different, as are their interests. Jake is a hothouse flower, his artistic talents and sensitivities carefully cultivated by his parents. Tony, whose father travels for work and is almost never at home (Hernan, a friend of Leonor’s played by Alfred Molina, is around a lot) is more of a   kid. He’s gregarious and easygoing and dreams of being an actor. The two boys conceive a plan to apply to a specialized arts high school together. When parents are around, “Little Men” feels like a modest, precise drama of urban life, but when it follows Tony and Jake, absorbing the loose rhythms of their companionship, the film becomes something richer and harder to classify. It’s a boys adventure story edged with unspoken risks, and the young actors take the kind of chances that their more careful and disciplined elders have been trained to avoid. There are inklings of sexual desire between the boys and implications of homophobia in the world around them, but mostly there is a sense of discovery and change, of all the unruly and enigmatic experiences often collapsed into the phrase “  . ” There is also a protest against the banal imperatives of maturity, and above all against the ways that adults ignore and discount the emotional lives of the young. Kathy, Brian and Leonor would do anything for their sons except take their relationship seriously, and the possibility that something as precious and real as friendship could be sacrificed because of money registers as a profound insult. And also as a fact of life. Mr. Sachs, in his last three features  —   this one, “Love Is Strange” and “Keep the Lights On”  —   has refined a style of emotional realism that stands out against both the mumbly diffidence and the sociological scorekeeping of too much independent American cinema. “Little Men” only looks like a small movie. “Little Men” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Parental guidance is the worst. Running time: 1 hour 25 minutes.",0
20602,20602,The Election Highlighted a Growing Rural-Urban Split - The New York Times,"Emily Badger, Quoctrung Bui and Adam Pearce","Donald J. Trump fared very poorly in American cities in Tuesday’s election. Hillary Clinton did just as badly among rural voters. The political divide between the two groups has been growing more stark in America for years, and 2016 showed an even sharper split than 2012. Multiple forces are pulling the American geography apart, as the   and   suburbs remain the contested political ground in between. The election reinforces the feeling that the prosperity of many metropolitan areas is not shared by the rest of the country. Mr. Trump made no real play for urban voters, despite living and running businesses in their midst. He went so far as to depict them as dystopias, a strategy that has long helped Republicans stoke enthusiasm among voters outside cities. And so it is little surprise that the urban counties that include Austin, Tex. Chicago Los Angeles Oakland, Calif. Portland, Ore. Seattle Denver and Newark voted for the Republican candidate in this election in   numbers. Mr. Trump’s own Manhattan gave him just 10 percent, a new nadir for a G. O. P. presidential candidate in the borough. His    home, Washington, gave him just 4 percent. Most of the change, though, occurred not around the big cities  —   where Democratic candidates have only so many votes left to pick up  —   but far outside them. Just 15 counties tilted by more than five percentage points in favor of Mrs. Clinton relative to how they voted in 2012. By contrast, 1, 826 moved by at least that much away from the Democratic candidate. The counties that swung the most drastically toward Mr. Trump, by 15 points or more, were nearly all in the Midwest. That abrupt shift was probably driven by numerous factors that are hard to untangle: weak economic prospects Mrs. Clinton’s lack of attention to those places on the campaign trail Mr. Trump’s xenophobic message to voters anxious about change. But the widening political divergence between cities and   America also reflects a growing alienation between the two groups, and a sense  —   perhaps accurate  —   that their fates are not connected. The University of Wisconsin political scientist Katherine J. Cramer, the author of “The Politics of Resentment,” described what this looked like during years of field research in Wisconsin in an insightful interview with Jeff Guo at The Washington Post. The people she met across a state that Mrs. Clinton ultimately lost felt deeply disrespected (and suspicious of a   academic from   Madison). “They would say, ‘The real kicker is that people in the city don’t understand us,’ ” Ms. Cramer said. “ ‘They don’t understand what rural life is like, what’s important to us and what challenges that we’re facing. They think we’re a bunch of redneck racists.’ ” Cities, for their part, are easily branded with some dissonance as embodying either professional elites or poor people who don’t deserve benefits (thus both Madison and Milwaukee, two very different places, come in for equal resentment within Wisconsin). Many of the young Democratic voters who live in blue cities like these, as Alec MacGillis has noted, have gravitated away from redder parts of the country from which they felt alienated. “There’s just nothing to do in Ohio,” lamented one voter who grew up there but now lives in Los Angeles. “The jobs are limited, but it’s not just the jobs and the industries that are in Ohio, it’s the   that I didn’t gravitate to. ” As the relationship between density and partisanship has grown stronger over the last   the structure of the economy has also changed in ways that reinforce the divide. At the height of Detroit’s auto industry in the early 1950s, the C. E. O. of General Motors, Charles Wilson, memorably pronounced that what was good for the country was good for his company, and vice versa. That’s no longer true of the major industries in big American cities (or the people who work for them) argues Aaron Renn, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. G. M. had trouble selling cars when the national economy was bad. Its customer base depended on a stable middle class far from Detroit. That’s not true today of Facebook, or Google, or Goldman Sachs, Mr. Renn says. They don’t rely on dealers all over the country. Their bottom lines aren’t tied to material prosperity in   Wisconsin. “In a sense, the   economy in these urban areas is disconnected from the success from the rest of the country,” Mr. Renn said. And the very things that drive success in Silicon Valley’s tech industry, or New York City’s financial sector, are what worries rural America: globalization, foreign trade, immigration. “Goldman Sachs and Google do not really need America to be a     success in order for them to be personally successful. ” Those economic forces will probably grow only stronger, even as the effects of an election that pushed urban and rural America further apart recede.",0

20606,20606,‘I Was Terrified’: Inmates Say They Paid a Brutal Price for a Guard’s Injury - The New York Times,Tom Robbins,"The inmates were just starting their day on July 6 when dozens of corrections officers burst into their dormitory, shouting for everyone to get down on the floor. The raid at   Correctional Facility, outside Utica, N. Y. officials said, was a surprise search for weapons made urgent after a bloody injury to a guard three days earlier. But over the next two hours, according to inmates, officers beat and stomped on each of the more than 30 prisoners present that morning, screaming curses and racial epithets and destroying property. Several men said their ribs were broken by kicks and punches. A    prisoner said he was rammed, headfirst, through the Sheetrock wall in his room. Down the hall, a    inmate said his nose was broken as a guard repeatedly slammed a metal door into his face. In a whispered interview last month in the visiting room of the   prison, a    inmate from Brooklyn recalled how an officer knelt beside him as he lay on the floor. The prisoner, Raymond Broccoli, who is serving a   sentence for robbery, said the officer hissed, “You want to know what it feels like to feel weak?” Mr. Broccoli said the guard then jammed “something metal” into his rectum. “It was bigger than a pen, about the size of those small flashlights they carry,” he said. At least two other inmates have claimed they were similarly violated. The prisoners said they were warned to keep quiet and not seek medical treatment, otherwise the guards would attack again. But on Nov. 2, a week after a Marshall Project reporter asked about the episode, the state’s corrections commissioner suspended the prison’s two top officials, the superintendent and his deputy, pending an inquiry. A spokesman for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision said that its Office of Special Investigations and State Police officers were investigating the dormitory raid and the July 3 injury to the prison guard that preceded it. The department “will not tolerate any wrongdoing that puts the safety of its facilities at risk, and will not hesitate to pursue disciplinary charges or refer cases for criminal prosecution if warranted,” the spokesman said. Investigators face dueling narratives: The guards’ union insists the injured officer was the victim of a planned attack by two prisoners affiliated with the Bloods street gang. Inmates cite a different culprit, a rickety reclining chair from which the officer fell, gashing his head as the two prisoners rushed to his aid. As in most of the state’s prisons, there were no cameras to record the episodes, officials said. The guard, Nicholas Kahl, a Navy veteran in his   who had been a corrections officer for two years, has been out on medical leave since the injury, records show. He did not respond to emails or return phone calls. Whatever happened to him, the ensuing assault was indefensible, a lawyer retained by inmates’ relatives said. “The apparent breadth of involvement by correction officers and   supervisors at   in this barbaric and unjustified use of collective punishment is stunning,” said the lawyer, Edward Sivin, who has filed a notice of intent to sue in the state’s Court of Claims on behalf of 32 inmates. The union, the New York State Correctional Officers  Police Benevolent Association, declined to comment. “As with previous unsubstantiated allegations made by convicted felons, it is more prudent to allow the investigation to be completed so we know all of the facts,” said James Miller, a union spokesman. The allegations of brutality against inmates at   are the latest involving New York prisons. “Excessive use of force in prisons, we believe, has reached crisis proportions in New York State,” Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said as he announced charges in September against five officers accused of beating an inmate at Downstate Correctional Facility in 2013. His office also investigated the death of an inmate at Fishkill Correctional Facility last year after a violent clash with officers, although no charges resulted. In March 2015, three officers at Attica Correctional Facility pleaded guilty to charges of official misconduct after their unprovoked beating of an inmate who had many bones broken. Jack Beck, a director of the Correctional Association of New York, a nonprofit authorized by the state to monitor prisons, said the scale of the alleged attack at   was surprising. “Do guards retaliate when an officer is injured? Yes,” he said. “They come in and throw property around, smack people. But to significantly assault large numbers of people, that’s unusual. ” The guards at the prison, in Marcy, a rural town along the Erie Canal, refused to accept that Officer Kahl’s injury had been an accident, inmates said. Ricardo Moore, chairman of an inmate liaison committee there, served in the Army during Operation Desert Storm and said he and Officer Kahl talked about their military experiences. “He was easygoing. No one was mad at him,” said Mr. Moore, 45, who is serving a   sentence for drug possession. He said the guard usually sat in a plexiglass office known as “the bubble” in the dormitory’s day room, with his legs propped up on the desk as he reclined in a chair. “I used to joke with him about that chair,” Mr. Moore said. “I said, ‘Look out, you are going to fall over. ’” That day, Mr. Moore recalled, Officer Kahl made his rounds and then went into the office, which included a desk and a locker, and was often unsecured. He said he saw the guard “leaning back in his chair with a book open, but his eyes were closed. ” Moments later, when he was in his room, Mr. Moore heard a commotion. He ran back to the day room. “I see two inmates inside the bubble and they are trying to help Kahl up off the floor. ” Stacey Wyne, 36, who was released in August after serving four years for selling drugs, said he also witnessed the guard reclining in the chair. “I even know the book he was reading, a Stuart Woods novel,” Mr. Wyne said. “He just fell over. ” He said two inmates entered the office to help Officer Kahl. “They were asking him was he O. K. and he says, ‘Yeah. ’” One of the inmates said he was going to pull an emergency alarm carried by officers to get help, Mr. Wyne recalled. In prison it is called “pulling the pin,” and considered a summons to a major emergency. Officer Kahl said no, Mr. Wyne said, but “they pulled it anyways. ” A news release issued by the union said guards responding to the alarm found Officer Kahl unconscious and bleeding. He received eight stitches over his eyebrow. Two inmates who guards believed were responsible for the wound were taken to solitary confinement. Four months later, no criminal charges have been filed or disciplinary actions taken against those inmates, a corrections department spokesman said. The prisoner accused of leading the attack, Darnell Getfield, 27, of Brooklyn, has since been moved to another   prison. Typically, inmates accused of assaulting officers are given lengthy sentences in isolation at   prisons. Mr. Getfield, who is serving a   sentence for assault and weapons possession, did not respond to a letter asking him to contact a reporter. Two inmates said Mr. Getfield may have had gang ties, but they noted he was also a member of the inmate liaison committee and appeared to have had a good relationship with Officer Kahl. Immediately after the guard was injured, Mr. Moore said, corrections officers and prison administrative employees began grilling inmates. As Mr. Moore was questioned, an officer loomed over him, threatening to beat him with a ream of copying paper, the inmate said. Later, Mr. Moore said he was handcuffed and underwent further interrogation. Officers held him over a stairwell by the waist of his pants. “They said, ‘Have you ever taken an elevator ride? ’” Mr. Moore recalled. “I was terrified. They said I had better tell the right story. ” Another inmate, Mr. Broccoli, said he was taken in handcuffs to a room where a guard stood beside him as he was questioned by an administrative employee. “He was saying: ‘We know who ordered it and we know who did it. You better tell us. ’” Each time he insisted he did not know, Mr. Broccoli said, the officer “smacks me and bangs my head against the wall. ” At one point, Mr. Broccoli said, the guard whispered in his ear, “What’s a white guy like you doing protecting” the inmates, describing them as animals and using a racial slur. Most of the dormitory residents were black or Latino, Mr. Broccoli said, while all of the officers involved were white. Mr. Broccoli was one of seven men interviewed in prison or after they were released who have provided accounts on the record of what happened three days later. Seven other inmates described the episode in letters to Mr. Sivin, the lawyer. (Their names were redacted in copies provided to a reporter because they did not want to be publicly identified.) “I will never forget that day,” Mr. Wyne said. “I made some mistakes. But I shouldn’t have been treated like that. ” He said as many as 40 officers raced into the dorm, known as House 4H, situated in one of a cluster of buildings at   which is adjacent to two other large state prisons. “They came running inside yelling and beating on everyone,” Mr. Wyne said. He and three roommates were punched and kicked as officers emptied prisoners’ lockers and tipped them over, he said. One guard, he recalled, said, “‘You look like you need your hair washed,’ and he dumped my VO5 on top of me. Then another cop kicks me in the head. ” When the raid was over, “the place looked like Hurricane Katrina,” Mr. Wyne said. “People were under mattresses they had thrown on top of them, they had lockers on top of them. ” Pablo Dones, 58, who is serving a   term for violating his drug conviction parole, said that when the guards came into the dorm, he flung himself on the floor, arms outstretched. “You could hear the slaps and the kicks, and everything getting smashed,” Mr. Dones said. “Guys were yelling in pain. ” He said the first guard who entered his room kicked one of his roommates, a    man named Tony King, in the head. “Hurt him bad,” Mr. Dones said. When a guard ordered him to stand, Mr. Dones, who had recently undergone hernia surgery, said he struggled to his feet. “I made it to one knee and he kicked me right where I had the operation. ” He screamed in pain, he said, but another guard grabbed him and began banging his head against the wall. “He was hitting me against the wall so many times, my head went right through it,” Mr. Dones said. For weeks, he said, he had a large    knob on his forehead. “They just ran amok,” he said. Matthew Petrillo, 41, recalled that as he lay on the floor beside his locker, a guard smashed its metal door into his face many times. He was released on parole last month after serving five years for selling drugs. His mother said she was shocked by his appearance when he came home. “His face was so messed up, I was crying I couldn’t believe it,” said his mother, Linda, who did not want her surname used because she fears official retaliation. “He did something wrong and he paid his dues. But send him back to me in one piece. You have no right to abuse him. ” Matthew Aliaga, 28, who is serving three years for grand larceny and forgery, said guards kicked him in the chest and the leg as another officer stood on his ankle. Mr. Aliaga, who is gay and taking hormones to transition to female, said officers called him “disgusting names,” including a gay slur. One officer ground his hormone medications to dust with his boot, he said. Another tore some of his books apart. “I had this book by Anderson Cooper about him and his mother that I was really looking forward to reading,” he said, “and they just destroyed it. ” Mr. Moore said most of the officers had removed their name tags. They hurled slurs and curses at the prisoners, he and other inmates remembered. “‘Oh, you like to pick on the weak? See how you like it,’” he recalled them saying. “They were telling the white guys, ‘You are a disgrace to the white race. ’” He said he was kicked in the head, the ribs and the legs, then beaten with fists. He and other inmates reported that officers sliced electric cords on appliances the inmates had in their rooms, including lamps, clocks and radios. As the raid wound down, Mr. Moore said he heard guards calling out, “The brass is coming. ” A few minutes later, he said, he saw the superintendent, Joseph Ward, and his top deputies walking down the hall. Mr. Ward and Joseph Corey, the deputy for security, were suspended this month. He and another inmate were later ordered to sweep up the dorm, he said. “We got to one room and there were two guards in there urinating on the floor, all over the guys’ stuff,” he said. One of the officers, Mr. Moore said, addressed him. “He said, ‘Moore, you’re a veteran, right?’ I said yes. He said, ‘What do you do when someone tries to injure one of your buddies?’ I said my military responsibility would be to hurt him back. He said: ‘So you see why we are doing this. You guys tried to kill one of ours. ’” The prisoners said they were warned not to talk. Phone calls and mail would be monitored. “We’ll be back to do this all over again,” a prison lieutenant threatened, Mr. Moore said. Still, word got out. Mr. Broccoli, who has since been moved to another prison, said that he was mocked by guards after the episode. They “snicker when I walk by,” he said. “I am so ashamed all the time. I’ve questioned my manhood. ” Nelson Friszell, 44, who is serving five years for selling drugs, asked his wife to relay to a reporter how he had also been beaten and sodomized with a metal object by the prison’s guards. “My husband is a big man,” said his wife, Deirdre Velez. “I think they were trying to take his dignity. ”",0

20608,20608,Harry Reid Desperately Accuses Trump And FBI Of Violating The Hatch Act,Lisa Smith,"0 comments 
During his final few months in the Senate, senile old Harry Reid has saved his most insane accusation for last. 
He is accusing the FBI Director of treason due to his announcement that the department is searching additional documents that could provide information related to the Hillary Clinton email probe. 
What a loony. 
In a last ditch effort to save dirty Clinton, Reid accused the FBI chief of violating the Hatch Act, in other words, acting with political motives as a government official. Reid concluded that the FBI director violated this act by sending his letter to Congress days before Election Day. 
Reid stated that according to CBS News ,“Your actions in recent months have demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another,” Then he added that that through Comey’s “partisan actions, you may have broken the law.” Harry Reid: FBI Director Comey’s ‘Partisan Actions’ May Violate Federal Law – Letter: pic.twitter.com/agXy4D1igh 
— Ryan Ruggiero (@RyanRuggiero) October 30, 2016 
Violations of the Hatch Act are a serious offense (you might recall this, because numerous Obama Administration officials have been accused of violating the federal law with zero action taken against them. 
“[Y]our highly selective approach to publicizing information, along with your timing, was intended for the success or failure of a partisan candidate or political group,” Reid wrote. 
In providing examples of what he claims are a violation of the Hatch Act, Reid pointed to the “selective approach:” Comey’s refusal to of investigate Trump and his possible campaign ties to the Russian government. 
“In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government – a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity,” he said. “I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public… and yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information.” 
“You’re rushed to take this step eleven days before a presidential election, despite the fact that for all you know, the information you possess could be entirely duplicative of the information you already examined which exonerated Secretary Clinton,” he said. 
The Hatch Act is a federal law that was passed in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to limit federal agencies or its employees from interfering with political activities or federally funded programs. 
This means federal employees can’t hold fund-raisers for politicians or receive donations, but they can vote for or against candidates running in an election, the law states. 
Reid ended the letter reminding the director that he used to be a supporter of Comey’s – even when Republicans filibustered his nomination as FBI chief: “I led the fight to get you confirmed because I believed you to be a principled public servant,” Reid concluded. “With the deepest regret, I now see that I was wrong.” 
In all actuality, Comey told Congress that even though he wasn’t “closing the case” in the FBI probe of Hillary’s emails, he was still ending the investigation. 
Ironically can you imagine if he hadn’t sent the letter? With the recent revelations, had he not sent a letter to Congress, he would have been blamed for attempting to lie to Congress and cover-up further investigation. As it stands, by sending the letter, he is simply accused of partisanship by sending the letter. 
I’d say he’s damned if he does and damned if he doesn’t. 
I little suspicion that Comey has a backbone MUCH stronger than Harry Reid or any of his spineless Democratic accusers now. 
What an act of desperation on the Democrats part. Hillary is doing nothing but grasping at straws, whether or not anything comes of this new investigation before the election, we’ll see, but to actually accuse Comey of treason, is utter idiocy. Related Items",1
20609,20609,"Theresa May, Daniel Ortega, China: Your Tuesday Briefing - The New York Times",Charles McDermid,"Good morning.  We’re trying something new for our readers in Asia and Australia: a morning briefing to   your day.  What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes. com. Here’s what you need to know: • Voting begins in a few hours in the United States. Polls show a tight race nationally and in swing states, though early voting data bodes well for Hillary Clinton. We boarded Donald J. Trump’s plane for an inside look at his last stand. He’s betting big on less educated white voters. And even if he loses, his campaign’s legacy will live on, in the form of emboldened extremists. Here’s our live coverage of the last hours of the race. We’re offering unlimited access to NYTimes. com for the election, from now through Thursday morning. _____ • Hong Kong is bracing for street protests and tough questions about the independence of its courts after China barred two   city politicians from taking their seats in the legislature. The move could open an era in which Hong Kong’s elected officials can be punished if they fail to meet a vague standard of political loyalty to the central government. _____ • China’s new cybersecurity law gives the authorities far greater control over the internet as of next summer. Its requirements  —   including real names for messaging services and security checks in the finance and communication industries  —   are raising concerns about freedom of speech and barriers to foreign businesses. _____ • Australia will not legalize   marriage anytime soon. A bill that would have allowed for a plebiscite on the issue was shot down in Parliament over the $140 million cost and concerns that it would become a platform for hate speech. Polls show around 70 percent of Australians want marriage equality, and many supporters of legalization want action in Parliament, not a nonbinding plebiscite. _____ • Heavy smog continues to choke New Delhi, where schools are closed and emergency measures are in place to improve air quality that is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. Asked where she lived, a New Delhi resident said, “a gas chamber. ” _____ • The Philippine Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether President Rodrigo Duterte may transfer the remains of Ferdinand E. Marcos, the country’s former dictator, to a heroes’ cemetery in Manila. The justices have another Duterte case on the docket: a senator who has often been critical of him has asked the court for an order to stop him from retaliating with verbal attacks, which have included speeches in which he called her a “dirty woman” and discussed her private life. • Warner Bros. a division of Time Warner, is often in the shadow of its sibling HBO. Kevin Tsujihara, above right, the film studio’s chief executive, wants to change all that. He is on pace to deliver record operating profit and may have a hit with the new J. K. Rowling film, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. ” • China will release its balance of trade figures  —   how its exports and imports compare  —   for October, offering another data point for the health of the country’s economy. • The Sotheby’s auction house reported a loss of $54 million in the third quarter, citing a slowdown in the art market and the purchase of an advisory business. • U. S. markets surged on election news, and the dollar was up. Here’s a snapshot of global markets. • The Nicaraguan president, Daniel Ortega, was   to a third term in an election that many disaffected voters simply ignored. [The Wall Street Journal] • A German sailing couple, who were seized and held for ransom eight years ago by Somali pirates, were reported to have been abducted again in dangerous waters near the Philippines. [The New York Times] • Japanese government investigators raided the offices of a national advertising giant, Dentsu, after the death of a young woman it employed was attributed to overwork. [The Asahi Shimbun] • China’s   a sleek   fighter, demonstrates the country’s growing power as a military force and an arms maker. [Foreign Policy] • The scandal engulfing South Korea’s presidency was uncovered because of a card game in Macau. [The Washington Post] • Mikheil Saakashvili, a former president of Georgia, quit his post in Ukraine’s government and accused the Ukrainian president of blocking efforts to fight corruption. [The New York Times] • The British prime minister, Theresa May, offered improved visa arrangements to India in trade talks meant to bolster ties ahead of the “Brexit. ” [The New York Times] • Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as U. S. attorney general, died at age 78. She played a major role in some of the most divisive episodes of the presidency of Bill Clinton. • The world’s youngest chess grandmaster,    Sergey Karjakin of Russia, is about to challenge the reigning world champion in New York. • A new study finds that whale songs need to be felt as well as heard. The sounds are accompanied by vibrations that course hundreds if not thousands of feet through the water, possibly enhancing    communication. • A Chinese Paralympic champion was nowhere to be seen at the finish of the New York City Marathon. Turned out her wheelchair had blown a tire at Mile 13  —   so three people, aided by a translation app, stepped in to help. “It really was a cool New York moment,” one said. Britons have been saying a lot of goodbyes in the past few months. They voted to leave the European Union. The prime minister resigned. The leading figures of the “Brexit” campaign departed the government. And through all this, the news media outside Britain found one expression that worked in multiple languages: “English leave. ” It’s a play on “taking French leave,” which the British use to mean departing abruptly  —   supposedly a reference to the French manner of leaving a social function without saying goodbye. Such nationalist expressions abounded around the 19th century, when rival nations in a disunited Europe settled scores in wars, revolutions and slights. But the Germans also pick on the Poles for evaporating from parties, which the British call an “Irish goodbye. ” (The German weekly “Die Zeit” even graphed the zingers and  .) Of course, the slaps don’t end with departures. Germans can mention, though rarely, “English shopping”  —   that is, theft, as in the colonial past. And references to historic battles get drawn into the mix, too. So the French could say, depending on how Brexit works out, “c’est un vrai coup de Trafalgar,” a true Trafalgar blow, reminiscent of their decisive defeat by the English in 1805.

Women have come a long way since the sexual revolution. Through subsidization and affirmative action that makes up centuries of mean-spirited discrimination, they’ve shown their grit in a number of fields the Old Boys Club never thought possible. They’ve blown past the fitness tests which lives hinge on as firefighters , they demonstrate amazing coolness and discipline as police officers , and have become billionaires revolutionizing blood work as we know it. 
Anything you can do, women can do better! I don’t know why men even exist anymore! 
A majority of women are, according to most polls, hopeful that they will be able to push new frontiers by electing the first female president of the United States. And while the Patriarchy has in the past asserted that a world run by women would essentially mean world peace, sexist bigots will be proven wrong if Hillary takes office and makes good on her promise to start a nuclear war with Russia over Syria for no coherent reason. Gen X and single women, who are too confident and smart for any man to want to marry, are the biggest Hil fanatics. 
Rawwrrr, come turn off this Pussy Riot, Putin! 
Yet, even with all this progress, there’s still one last He-Man Woman-Hater’s club that looks down on women from their glass ceiling, hogging up all the glory for themselves. Did I say glass ceiling? I meant grass floor: Mmmm , Man Tears 
The only place in modern American culture where you will see a white male portrayed with dignity, honor and pride is in military recruitment ads. In these ads, the black man is shown at best as a white man’s equal, rather than as a smarter, better-looking, more masculine superior, in contrast to many movies, TV shows and most commercials. In the last Iraq War, white privilege and racism meant that in our very diverse country, non-Jewish white males were overrepresented among fatalities, and are heavily over represented in frontline and infantry roles. 
While Neo-conservative (((Jennifer Rubin))) and others of her (((ilk))) dedicate their columns to mocking, attacking and threatening white males based on nothing but who you are, the mange-inflicted yentl buckles at the knees when you put on that uniform and die in one of the many wars she pushes for. 
Get it through your thick skull you racist, privileged, baby-dicked white boy goyim: the only thing you’re good for is to fight for Israel! 
In light of this institutional patriarchy and privilege, #DraftOurDaughters has emerged to raise consciousness. This social media campaign is composed of Hillary Clinton’s coalition of non-whites and women – shut out of military combat roles by worthless racist rednecks – eager to make her dream of a World War with an emerging and more advanced superpower come true. 
We need women, blacks, Mexicans, and especially Jews (.02% of the US military while 2% of the US population) to come on in. Women especially, who have been shut out of Selective Service for the draft, should be given priority over men when the draft comes in order to mitigate decades of discrimination. 
Here are some of the memes already floating around. #DraftOurDaughters is grassroots progress Martin Luther King Jr. (Peace Be Upon Him) would be proud of. I encourage you to make your own and put them up on Twitter, we’ll show that rude bigot Vladimir Putin what the New America can do:",1

Anti-fluoridation activists in Georgia received a major boost of support when former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Jimmy Carter, Andrew Young, sent a letter to Georgia Governor Nathan Deal and House Speaker David Ralston demanding hearings to investigate why water fluoridation is being continued in the state despite all the reasons to end it. 
Ambassador Young is asking for a written response. His letter was also sent to the CEO of the American Water Works Association, David LaFrance. 
“What’s clear to me is that we need a repeal of Georgia’s water fluoridation law, and hearings to look into how fluoridation has continued all these years, long after there were plenty of reasons to end it,” Ambassador Young wrote. 
“This is a civil rights issue, and the people have the right to have the full story given to them, rather than highly edited, misleading talking points.” 
Young also addressed the sketchy nature of the pro-fluoridation argument when he wrote, When someone’s story keeps changing, there are quite often motivations behind their changed stance that may not be aligned with the best interests of the public. The story offered by water fluoridation promoters keeps changing…and changing…and changing. There are key groups such as seniors, kidney patients, diabetics, communities of color, thyroid patients and people who drink a lot of water due to their occupation that are especially effected by Fluoridegate. 
“I am calling for Fluoridegate hearings, here, in Georgia and I am calling for a repeal of Georgia’s fluoridation law, immediately,” Young added. 
You can read the full text of Young’s letter here . We congratulate Ambassador Young on having the courage to speak out on this issue and we eagerly await the written response to it. Even more important, we are looking for an end to water fluoridation in Georgia.",1

by Joseph Jankowski
Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor and architect of Obamacare Jonathan Gruber told CNN’s Carol Costello on Wednesday that Obamacare, which is set to see a sharp increase in premium prices next year, is going just as planned. 
When asked what could be done to the Affordable Care Act in order to drive the prices of premiums down, Gruber responded by saying “the law is working as designed.”

“Look, once again, there is no sense of just what has to be fixed, the law is working as designed,” Gruber told CNN. “However, it could work better and I think the most important thing experts would agree on is that we need a larger mandate penalty.”
Johnathan Gruber made headlines in 2014 when video surfaced of him saying that the “lack of transparency” and the “stupidity of the American voter” helped Obamacare become law.

“Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage,” Gruber said. “And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass.”
Gruber made the comments while discussing how law was “written in a tortured way” to avoid a negative score from the Congressional Budget Office. He suggested that that Obamacare would have been rejected if the penalties for going without health insurance were interpreted as taxes.
“If CBO scored the (individual) mandate as taxes, the bill dies,” Gruber said.
“If you had a law that made it explicit that healthy people are going to pay in and sick people are going to get subsidies, it would not have passed,” he added.
As the AP reported yesterday, the Obama Administration has confirmed that premiums will sharply rise under the Obamacare law, with many consumers left with only one insurer to choose from.
Premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase on average 25% across 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services.
“Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period,” Larry Levitt, who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, told the Associated Press .

20613,20613,"Dear America, Let’s Now Unite and Flood Our Nation With Optimism",Eric Odom,"Dear America,
Whether you voted for Trump or not, surely you can join me in admitting the past few years have been devoid of optimism. We’ve been pessimistic on the economy, on the social foundation of our country, our standing in the world, our concern over potential for war, our healthcare, our jobs and generally speaking… our future.
For some of you Barack Obama may be a likable character. While many of us believe he’s corrupt and wrong in his way of thinking, it’s understandable that many of his voters found him to be generally likable. For those who do, the truth is he betrayed you. He betrayed all of us.
His healthcare law was sold to you as a law that would make healthcare affordable and wouldn’t change the plan/doctor you have. Most of us are now finding that was a lie. We’re losing our plans and doctors, and costs are skyrocketing.
His economic policy enriched the mega rich while crushing jobs. His environmental policy has pumped billions of our dollars into the pockets of special interests, killed off jobs and did absolutely nothing for the environment. His tax policy is painful. If you pay taxes you know this to be the case.
He spends money like it grows on trees. For him it’s not an issue. He lives in the high castle and will never have to worry about money. But you and I? Yeah, it’s an issue.
He dragged us nearly into world war with Russia. He collapsed the Middle East in a way that has rippled across the globe.
We can disagree on issues, but surely we can agree this hasn’t been a good situation. Something has to change. Hillary Clinton wasn’t going to change anything. She was going to take Obama’s burning agenda and throw gasoline on it.
We now have an opportunity. Donald Trump has his flaws. We all have concerns about it. No secret there. But his plan is something we should all get excited about. That is, of course, provided he actually follows through with it.
Trump is likely to relax tensions with Russia. He’s likely to pull back our nonsensical involvement in the Middle East. He’s likely to repeal and replace Obamacare. He’s likely to initiate a tax and economic policy that WILL invigorate business growth.
For businesses, Trump has a plan that will help create spenders. And for consumers his plan will help us earn and retain more financial stability.
This is a good thing. It’s good for liberals, conservatives and independents. It’s good for America.
Not long ago there was a time when Americans were optimistic, hungry for success and excited to work hard for it. We’ve exiting a period of time where that mentality has been non-existent. We’re entering a time where it can exist again.
We’ve got a mess on our hands. There is much work to do to clean it up. But it can be cleaned up, and we can flourish as a result of it.
That is, if we unify and optimistically strive for success as a nation.
It’s time, America. It’s long overdue.
Let’s make America great again.

20614,20614,Ravish Kumar’s prime time show nominated for Filmfare Awards under best drama series,Flying Table-fan,"Ravish Kumar’s prime time show nominated for Filmfare Awards under best drama series Posted on Tweet (Image via youtube.com) 
Ravish Kumar’s prime time show has been nominated for the Filmfare Awards under the category of best drama series. The Filmfare Awards Committee has unanimously decided to nominate the show after watching the thought-provoking episode titled ‘ Are we to stop questioning? ’ which was aired last night. 
During the screening of the show on NDTV India, viewers across India witnessed cinematographic brilliance, portraying the unjust system we live with, and Ravish Kumar, who previously produced the cult classic ‘The Dark Screen’ has once again won millions of hearts with his powerful performance. 
Although the show was primarily aimed at raising awareness about freedom of expression and highlighting the fascism that prevails in Modi’s regime, the jury members were particularly impressed by the dramatized presentation of the show by the immensely creative Ravish Kumar. 
The show opens with toxic air engulfing the city of Delhi, a metaphor for the oppression we have been subjected to, where the oppressor menacingly walks on the streets, keeping an eye on each and every individual. 
A couple of mime artists appear on the screen in the next segment and beautifully portray the ugly truth that we as a society should be ashamed of, a horrifying reality that most of us were unaware of. 
“The views are not only factually incorrect but also irrelevant to the issue he is trying to address,” one of the peons at The Times Group office raised an objection while serving tea to the jury members, “Isn’t this show supposed to be about the ban imposed on NDTV? The channel has been asked to go off air for leaking sensitive information but he is completely digressing here and talking about an imaginary authority that punishes those who question its actions.” 
“That’s called creative liberty, my friend,” asserts the jury member. 
The jury will decide the winner by the end of this month and the award will be formally presented at 62nd Britannia Filmfare Awards to be held next year. 
Meanwhile, TV production houses were queuing up to rope in Ravish Kumar for their next ventures after watching his show, but Balaji telefilms has apparently won the race. Sources revealed that he could be seen in the upcoming season of Kumkum Bhagya.",1
20615,20615,Clinton’s Policy On Syria Will Lead To WW3 Says Trump,Carol Adl,"  Carol Adl in Middle East , News , World // 0 Comments 
Donald Trump has warned that Hillary Clinton’s policy towards Syria would lead to World War III , arguing that the Democratic nominee would drag the US into a confrontation with nuclear armed Russia. 
Trump said “You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton” adding that “What we should do is focus on ISIS We should not be focusing on Syria” 
The US Republican presidential nominee made the remarks on Tuesday during a Reuters interview in response to Clinton’s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” in Syria. 
Press TV reports: 
On October 7, the Democratic nominee said a no-fly zone was required inside the war-ravaged country to stabilize fighting, a move that was opposed in Congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia, since a US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down Russian fighter jets should they enter Syrian airspace. 
Clinton also described the situation in Syria as “incredibly complex” since the intervention of Russia. 
“You’re not fighting Syria anymore; you’re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,” Trump said. 
The Republican nominee also referred to the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power as a second-level priority to defeating Daesh. 
“Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIL,” Trump said. 
Russia might down US planes 
Meanwhile, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also warned about the consequences of Clinton’s push for a no-fly zone in Syria that could spark a conflict with Russia. 
Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Clapper said Clinton’s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could lead to Russia shooting down American planes there. 
“I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they — if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,” he said. 
“I take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they — why they did that,” Clapper said of Russian weapons recently deployed to Syria. “The system they have there is a very advanced air-defense system. It’s very capable. And I don’t think they’d do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it.” 
During the third and final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her remarks on a no-fly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in Syria. 
A foreign-backed militancy has been going on in Syria since March 2011, with a plethora of armed groups — each supported by one foreign country or another — fighting the Assad government. 
Since 2014, the United States, along with a number of its allies, has been leading a so-called anti-terror campaign in Syria and neighboring Iraq. 
Instead of helping to rein in the Takfiri terrorists, the air raids have killed many civilians, and caused extensive damage to the country’s infrastructure.",1
20616,20616,Female Scientists Turn to Data to Fight Lack of Representation on Panels - The New York Times,Apoorva Mandavilli,"One day in August 2015, the Princeton University neuroscientist Yael Niv saw an email notice of a conference on deep brain stimulation, a hot topic in treatment for depression and other mental disorders. Dr. Niv noticed that none of the 21 scientists scheduled to speak were women. This was not the first time Dr. Niv had lamented a skewed lineup. For years, she had tried to persuade other conference organizers, sometimes successfully, to invite more women to speak. But something about this particular conference, perhaps that the organizers were women, pushed her and about 20 other female scientists to take action. Over a series of furious emails that night, they decided that the best approach they could take was scientific: They would collect data  —   irrefutable evidence  —   on the numbers of male and female speakers. The very next day, they started a website called BiasWatchNeuro, with an inaugural post on the conference. Since then, they have posted gender ratios among speakers at more than 60 conferences in various areas of neuroscience, and compared them with the base rates  —   the proportion of female scientists in that particular field. The base rates are estimated from the number of women in grants databases. If anything, Dr. Niv said, the site errs on the side of underestimating the base rates. At about half of the conferences listed on the site so far, the number of female speakers matches or surpasses the base rate in that field in general. But what fuels the project, Dr. Niv said, is how many conferences continue to fall not just a little, but far short, of the proportion of women in that field. For the gender ratio of panelists to mirror the base rate in that particular field, assuming the site’s estimates are accurate, the dark blue dots, above, would have to turn pink and the dark red dots would have to turn blue. There were a total of just 11 women (compared with 213 male speakers) at 13 conferences that fell in the egregious offender category  —   those that were more than two standard deviations below the base rate. You can also see that six conferences on the left had no female speakers at all, and that few conferences reached the 50 percent gender mark. Dr. Niv said that she and her colleagues believed that the gap between the ratio of the women in the field and on panels was primarily the result of implicit bias, which some of them have studied. “Implicit bias is just that  —   implicit: We are not aware of it,” she said. “We are not saying that conference organizers are bigots and purposefully discriminating they just can’t help it. ” Some conference organizers have been receptive to the criticism, adding more women to their lineups. But others in the world of neuroscience have taken issue with the mission. Panels should be organized based strictly on the speakers’ merit, they say, and not on any notion of fairness. Veerle   one of the organizers of the deep brain stimulation conference, said she was “puzzled by the gender issue” and had never experienced any bias. In selecting speakers for the conference, “it was not our goal to have an equal distribution between, for example, European and American lecturers, or black and white, or male and female,” she said. “Their scientific excellence was the criterion. ” Among the defenders of the project, however, is Anne Churchland, a neuroscientist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory who studies how people make decisions. In 2001, she started Anne’s List, a directory of 170 women in computational neuroscience, intended to silence claims that no good female scientists existed in that field. Her research suggests that someone you recently had lunch with or someone from your hometown might spring to mind when selecting a speaker, even though neither has anything to do with science. “It doesn’t feel like irrelevant information influences our judgment, but it does,” Dr. Churchland said. Being invited to speak on panels is more than a matter of prestige it’s how your peers come to know who you are, Dr. Niv said. “When you’re not known in science, you’re basically doomed, because when your papers are reviewed, they’re less likely to be accepted,” she said. “Your grants are less likely to be funded. ” When less than 50 percent of a field is made up of women, and then they are barely represented on panels, their ideas may never be heard by their colleagues, Dr. Niv said. “Science should not be biased,” she said. Addressing that, she added, “should be everybody’s priority. ”",0

E-pasaporte: ¿por domingo y para la televisión? por Herbert Mujica Rojas Socios | 27 de octubre de 2016 27-10-2016
En el magnífico reportaje que hizo Panorama el domingo 23 y en el segmento Revelan errores en los pasaportes biométricos con la investigación de Karina Novoa, se entrevistó a dos parlamentarios, Jorge del Castillo y Víctor A. García Belaunde, ambos se expidieron de acuerdo al momento y todos pensamos que ¡por fin! los legisladores se iban a ocupar del delicado y oprobioso tema.
Pero hasta hoy jueves se desconoce si cualquiera de los dos, del Castillo o García Belaunde, han cursado cartas convocando al Superintendente Nacional de Migraciones, Eduardo Sevilla o al titular del Interior, Carlos Basombrío, con el propósito que esclarezcan las múltiples dudas expuestas durante el programa televisivo.
Se va haciendo una dura realidad el hecho que las dos buenas pro otorgadas a Migraciones y a la Cancillería para los pasaportes electrónicos a cargo del consorcio Imprimerie Nationale (Francia) y Gemalto México, han resultado un fracaso impresionante. Quien tenga dudas basta con que mire, una y otra vez, Revelan errores, y no hay ¡ni una enmienda o comunicación oficial de esas empresas para nada de nada!.
Decíamos que cuando la aparición de los parlamentarios se abrió la esperanza que la representación nacional tomase cartas en el asunto que no es poca cosa: se trata de las credenciales que usan los peruanos para poder transitar más allá de las fronteras. Y no es un documento partidario ni ideológico: todos usan pasaporte y en este caso, debiera ser el electrónico o biométrico.
Si para temas de escasa monta u importancia, en todo caso, de menor jerarquía que el e-pasaporte, dichos legisladores son conocidos por el entusiasmo que ponen a la difusión de sus hechos, NO se entiende ¿cómo es que no han hecho nada luego de su participación el domingo 23 en Panorama? Estoy seguro que no deberíamos considerar la frivolidad que a los mencionados sólo interesa la aparición televisiva y ¡punto!
Si en Perú las cosas fueran lógicas, hace buen rato debió haberse constituido una comisión multipartidaria urgente con el único propósito de determinar qué hacer con esos dos contratos plagados de inconsistencias, debilidades, fallas, caídas del sistema y más defectos y que están perjudicando un quehacer de la Superintendencia de Migraciones que es una entidad del Estado al servicio de los peruanos.
¿Qué están esperando señores parlamentarios?, ¿que el desabastecimiento origine un caos mayúsculo?, ¿no creen que es hora de edificar las bases de un Congreso respetado y querido por la ciudadanía que aspira a que se vean, estudien y encaminen la solución de los problemas del pueblo? Encargar a grupos de imagen, levantar el muy alicaído prestigio del Parlamento, es una tontería y botadera de plata de los contribuyentes. ¡Estas son las decisiones que quiere la gente!
Ninguno de los congresistas puede alegar que no hay material escrito, penal y en proceso sobre el suceso de los pasaportes electrónicos. Y puedo decirlo con cierta autoridad de periodista autor de, por lo menos, una treintena o más, de artículos sobre la materia, todos plenos en documentación y afirmaciones que NO han recibido respuesta o refutación. ¿Por algo tiene que ser, no les parece?
¿Y el resto de los parlamentarios? ¿qué hace?
Un importante legislador, semanas atrás y de modo personal, me expresó su vibrante interés en el affaire del pasaporte electrónico y he ido nutriendo su correo electrónico de materiales de todo jaez y sobre este singular acápite. Me reservo el nombre para no avergonzarlo en su desidia y falta de tino político y de Estado.
Pero del Castillo y García Belaunde contrajeron una deuda moral y política con todos los que vieron Panorama. Estamos esperando que hagan algo, pronto, efectivo, ya mismo.

20618,20618,"USA continues drive to plutocracy, dismantling of state",John Stanton,"USA continues drive to plutocracy, dismantling of state By John Stanton Posted on November 8, 2016 by John Stanton 
Interest groups and lobbyists have been busy peddling their client’s interests since 1816 when Delaware manufacturer Isaac Briggs teamed up with his colleagues in an attempt to convince federal lawmakers to impose tariffs on the import of foreign made manufactures. 
Alexis de Tocqueville writing in his two volume set Democracy in America (1835, 1840) observed the unique American characteristic of banding together in civic and issue specific interest groups for the purpose of influencing lawmakers, regulators and public opinion at the local, state and national levels. 
Congressional legislation to limit the influence of lobbyists in the US Congress and the federal government at large arguably did not being in earnest until the 20 th Century. The landmark Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, passed on the eve of World War II, “requires persons acting as agents of foreign principals in a political or quasi-political capacity to make periodic public disclosure of their relationship with the foreign principal, as well as activities, receipts and disbursements in support of those activities requiring foreign company or government.” 
That act remains in force today. 
Nice try 
The Federal Regulation of Lobbying Act of 1946, the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 and the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 are notable for their attempts to inform the public who was lobbying for what interest and for how much money. The Open Government Act of 2007 mandated a one year waiting period for federal public servants before they could make the move through the revolving door to lucrative for-profit opportunities. 
President Barak Obama issued an Executive Order in 2009 known as the Ethics Commitments by Executive Branch Personnel. That decree sought to impose a two-year waiting period for executive branch appointees. 
US executive branch agencies can also write their own lobbying rules or modify those contained in legislative acts. Members of the US Congress can also play an active role above and beyond legislative actions. On December 18, 2008, then Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Richard Lugar of Indiana sent a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to the Clinton Foundation, and the soon to be confirmed US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, limiting the Clinton Foundation’s interactions with foreign governments. 
In the MOU, the Clinton Foundation was instructed to spin off the Clinton Global Initiative placing strictures on Bill Clinton’s ability to accept contributions from foreign governments. It appears that the Clinton’s ignored the MOU with the recent revelations of Qatar’s $1 million gift which went unreported. 
Thanks to WikiLeaks, the DNC hack, Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and others, the internal workings of the US-Corporate State have been pried open to reveal a can of filthy worms entangled with each other in every which way. And not a damn thing will change no matter who runs the country. The American people, their constitution, Bill of Rights and ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence are being tortured by opportunists. 
Besides that, they were written by “white people” back in the 1700s and so they hold no weight with large segments of the American citizenry. That, of course, plays right into the hands of the ‘color of money’ tech and financial interests who seek to eliminate the US nation-state leaving only the military, intelligence and the dollar’s printing presses as backstops. 
No win situation 
In practice, all the well-intentioned federal legislation, tireless efforts of lobbyist watchdogs and anti-revolving door advocates had done little to inhibit much of the influence peddling undertaken by foreign agents and governments, US law firms, interest groups, trade associations, corporations and lobbying houses. 
Nor have their efforts slowed the speed of the revolving door though which officials who on one day are protecting and defending the Constitution of the United States emerge on the other side claiming fealty to a corporation’s shareholders. The rules, regulations and procedures governing the process are not worth the paper they are printed on. 
The United States Supreme Court ruled that influence peddling by individuals or non-profit organizations are protected by the free-speech First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In 2010 the court’s Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission extended that concept to for-profit associations, corporations and labor unions. 
Predictably, organizations and wealthy individuals have flooded the federal government and the 2016 election cycle with money. 
According to the public interest website Opensecrets.org—which tracks lobbying and revolving door activity—from 2008 to 2016 over $15 billion was spent by assorted organizations for US federal level influence peddling for all manner of issues ranging from defense and finance to sports and healthcare. The National Football League works hard at the local, state and federal levels for public funds to get their stadiums subsidized at the expense of taxpayers 
In 2016 alone, $1.6 billion was billed by lobbyists to their clients. In that same year 10,498 individuals and organizations registered as lobbyists. 
But even knowing how the system works, Americans see no alternative because they do not want to do the very difficult work of rebooting the system or holding their so-called leaders accountable. 
A look at AT&T, Time Warner merger & influence 
In October, the world’s third largest telecommunications giant AT&T, a creature of the former Ma Bell System monopoly, offered cable and content provider Time Warner shareholders an $85 billion merger package. Both boards of directors gleefully approved the deal. Now that merger must receive the approval of the US Department of Justice and assorted state and federal regulatory bodies. If approved by regulators, the merger would create one the world’s largest media conglomerates with one side of the monster, AT&T, very tight with the US National Security Agency. 
To increase the likelihood of success, AT&T, for its part, has mobilized some 100 lobbyists in Washington, DC, and scores more across the nation to cajole public utility, state legislatures and governors into supporting the merger. The company is already on the march in the US Congress and at federal agencies like the Federal Communications Commission. Even the self-proclaimed titans in the US Congress who decry the influence of money in politics or swarms of lobbyists are on the dole. 
In 1999, Senator John McCain from the US state of Arizona and then chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, that oversees the telecommunications industry, introduced a bill that cleared the hurdles for AT&T’s acquisition of MediaOne Group, making AT&T, at the time, the largest cable company in the United States, the Center for Public Integrity said in a report. “His efforts did not go unrewarded: Two weeks after he introduced his bill, AT&T employees and their spouses contributed $10,000 to his presidential campaign in addition to $3,000 they gave him three days after AT&T announced its merger plans.” 
AT&T’s federal influencers include revolving door types like former Senators John Breaux of Louisiana and Trent Lott of Mississippi who now work for heavyweight Washington, DC, law-firm and influence house Squire, Patton and Boggs. AT&T will also apply pressure from its own board of directors, one of whom is former President Bill Clinton’s chief economic advisor Laura D’Andrea Tyson. Coincidently she once served as a board member for Ameritech Corporation, formerly part of the AT&T-Bell System and now owned by AT&T. And how about this? The board also includes the former chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission from 1997 to 200, William Kennard. 
Inches or sins? 
America is bankrupt and on the highway to hell. 
The outcome of the 2016 election will not halt that process unless the American people find a way out of the political, financial, cultural and military morass they and their leaders have created. There are two paths forward for Americans, it seems. 
The first is offered in dialogue from the movie Seven in which the serial killer John Doe (played by Kevin Spacey) innovatively murders seven people based on the Seven Deadly Sins. Sure, John’s methods are unsound but the ‘point’ he makes about the sickness and tolerance levels of society are spot on. 
John Doe: “A woman . . . so ugly on the inside she couldn’t bear to go on living if she couldn’t be beautiful on the outside. A drug dealer, a drug dealing pederast, actually! And let’s not forget the disease-spreading whore! Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face. But that’s the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it’s common, it’s trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I’m setting the example. What I’ve done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed . . . forever.” 
The second path and a better alternative to John Doe’s shock doctrine is from movie dialogue from Any Given Sunday in the famed inches speech by Coach D’Amato (played by Al Pacino). The football team has descended into the hell of cliques, internal clashes, off-field antics, and disagreements over play calling. No football team can be successful in such a situation. The team has to come together for some purpose. 
Americans face that challenge now. 
Coach D’Amato : “Either we heal as a team or we’re ‘gonna’ crumble inch by inch, play by play until we’re finished. We’re in hell right now, gentlemen . . . we can stay here, get the shit kicked out of us, or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb ‘outta’ hell . . . one inch at a time. You see life’s this game of inches, so is football. Because in either game—life or football—the margin for error is so small. I mean, one half a step too late or too early and you don’t quite make it. One half second too slow, too fast and you don’t quite catch it. I know if I’m ‘gonna’ have any life anymore it’s because I’m still willing to fight and die for that inch, because that’s what living is, the six inches in front of your face. The inches we need are everywhere around us. That’s a team, gentlemen, and either we heal, now, as a team, or we will die as individuals. That’s football guys, that’s all it is.”

20619,20619,‘They Are Convening A Grand Jury! Trust Me!’ Trump Surrogate LOSES IT Over Clinton Emails (VIDEO),Joe Clark,"  
On Sunday, during an appearance on Fox and Friends , Trump surrogate Brunell Donald-Kyei went into full-blown Mad Hatter mode as she “argued” the significance of the FBI’s recent announcement concerning Hillary Clinton’s emails. 
During the segment, after proclaiming that she’s an “attorney,” the Vice-Chair of Trump’s National Diversity Coalition declared that the FBI doesn’t just “reopen cases.” However, panelist Brian Benjamin observed that the FBI had not officially reopened the case against Clinton (most likely due to the fact that they have not actually found anything). 
This unauthorized use of logic on the Fox News channel prompted Donald-Kyei to quickly dive down a rabbit hole of far-right-wing conspiracy theories, first citing the Wikileaks Podesta emails as proof of Clinton’s corruption and then implying something much darker about the presidential candidate. 
“We’ve got Huma Abedin with 10,000 emails under “life insurance” because she doesn’t want an accidental death,” declared the Trump surrogate. 
Um. What? 
She then went on to rail against Clinton and Obama, accusing both of making race relations worse over the past eight years. 
“Hillary Clinton is running around saying [that], when she and the president have worked so hard over the last eight years to divide the country.” 
Without citing any concrete evidence, the attorney claimed that both Clinton and Obama worked to pit “whites against blacks, blacks against Hispanics,” and “Hispanics against Asians.” 
She further argued that unlike Obama and Clinton, Trump would bring Americans together. 
Donald-Kyei concluded her rant with a prediction as bulletproof as her logic. 
“Believe me, believe me, they are convening a grand jury,” Donald-Kyei exclaimed . “Trust me!” 
Donald Trump must have the greatest collection of mentally unbalanced, intellectually dishonest, and morally dubious surrogates of any presidential candidate in U.S. history.

20620,20620,How David Letterman’s Mother Endeared Him to Viewers - The New York Times,Jason Zinoman,"The first time David Letterman’s mom, Dorothy Mengering, appeared on “Late Night,” she was part of a Take Your Parents to   episode, in which the staff, including members of the band, stood not far from their mothers. It was the kind of oddball concept that Mr. Letterman pioneered in the middle of the 1980s, when his show was required viewing for the cool, young and caffeinated. Taking cameras outside the studio and into his office, Mr. Letterman recruited his mother, a   church secretary from the   town of Linton, Ind. to speak into a bullhorn through an open window of Rockefeller Plaza. “Attention, New York,” she said, her gentle voice amplified, as she made a reference to the “Today” crew. “My name is Jane Pauley. I’m being held prisoner by Willard Scott. He’s not wearing pants. ” Mr. Letterman had made a similar bullhorn joke with Bryant Gumbel five months earlier, but his comedy didn’t sting as much when filtered through his mother. It even acquired a new and essential incongruity, introducing a sweetness and warmth that made him more relatable to viewers who might have been alienated by his acerbic sensibility. Ms. Mengering, who died on Tuesday at 95, was the most unlikely television star. She was   reserved and, as her three children explained in a beautiful obituary, she “was the happiest when she could curl up in a quiet place with a book and a box of   cherries. ” And yet she became a major figure on Mr. Letterman’s shows over decades, a comic foil with a radiant smile whose cheerful unflappability contrasted perfectly with her son’s exasperation. Inspired by Howard Stern, who used conversations with his mother on his radio show, Mr. Letterman turned phone calls with Ms. Mengering into a regular feature in the early 1990s, asking her to review TV shows like “Cop Rock” (“It’s not something I’ll watch again,” she said) or recite a Top 10 list (“Top 10 Things Found in Dave’s Mom’s Refrigerator”). During these exchanges, Mr. Letterman portrayed the teasing, needling son while she gamely played along. During one show in February 1991, he told his audience that if he called his mother, who kept a garden and once worked at her husband’s flower shop, at this time of year, she would say something about how the “crocuses were up. ” This turned a mundane conversation into an unexpectedly funny and suspenseful joke about how predictable parents can be to their children. These dozen or so phone conversations took place when the comedic heart of “Late Night” had shifted from scripted comedy to the compelling personality of its host. Mr. Letterman surrounded himself with a series of vivid personalities  —   like Chris Elliott’s bizarre characters  —   who inspired   that revealed more of him than a monologue joke ever could. When Mr. Letterman moved to CBS in 1993 to begin “Late Show,” the role of his mother changed, shifting from an offstage voice to an   correspondent, reporting from her home in Indiana and at three different Winter Olympics, including one in Norway, where she interviewed Hillary Clinton. Through these remote videos, she proved unerringly polite and far more game than her son. (It’s hard to imagine Mr. Letterman in a tight yellow suit and joining a luge team.) These cameos were perfectly in sync with one of the main tactics of Mr. Letterman’s TV career: turning ordinary people into funny performers while also recasting the talk show, ripping it out of its context and placing it on an airplane or in a person’s home or on the streets of New York. What was striking about Ms. Mengering’s performances is how much the spotlight didn’t change her manner or style. No matter where she was or whom she was talking to, she maintained the same poise and equanimity. She didn’t mock show business, as her son did, but she appeared immune to its notorious seduction, and completely resisted being   or remotely theatrical. Mr. Letterman’s relationship with his mother was, of course, more complex than simply devoted parent and loving son. In interviews, he called her “the least demonstrative person” in the world, and he would tell a story about the first time his mother saw him perform live, when it was clear her muted response made an impact. After telling this anecdote to Mr. Stern on “Late Show” in 2013, his famously blunt listener flummoxed him with a joke: “You have mother issues, obviously, everyone knows that. ” Just as it’s impossible to understand another person’s marriage completely, the relationship between parent and child is also a mystery. The gift that Mr. Letterman gave his fans was allowing them to see things not just from his point of view, but also from his mother’s. What we saw, in the limited way that television allows, was a genuine woman whose emotional understatement couldn’t hide her unconditional love and a son who loved to poke fun, but then made sure he hadn’t gone too far. After Mr. Letterman got his mother to yell into a bullhorn in her first appearance, the kind of brazen and juvenile move that she clearly would never do on her own, he turned away from the camera and toward her and asked, “Did that just embarrass you to tears?” She flashed a toothy smile, looked down and said, “No, David. ” He chuckled and added with some relief, “O. K. good. ”",0
20621,20621,Tribunal Rejects Beijing’s Claims in South China Sea - The New York Times,Jane Perlez,"BEIJING  —   An international tribunal in The Hague delivered a sweeping rebuke on Tuesday of China’s behavior in the South China Sea, including its construction of artificial islands, and found that its expansive claim to sovereignty over the waters had no legal basis. The landmark case, brought by the Philippines, was seen as an important crossroads in China’s rise as a global power and in its rivalry with the United States, and it could force Beijing to reconsider its assertive tactics in the region or risk being labeled an international outlaw. It was the first time the Chinese government had been summoned before the international justice system. In its most significant finding, the tribunal rejected China’s argument that it enjoys historic rights over most of the South China Sea. That could give the governments of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam more leverage in their own maritime disputes with Beijing. The tribunal also said that China had violated international law by causing “irreparable harm” to the marine environment, endangering Philippine ships and interfering with Philippine fishing and oil exploration. “It’s an overwhelming victory. We won on every significant point,” said the Philippines’ chief counsel in the case, Paul S. Reichler. But while the decision is legally binding, there is no mechanism for enforcing it, and China, which refused to participate in the tribunal’s proceedings, reiterated on Tuesday that it would not abide by it. Speaking at a meeting with European leaders, President Xi Jinping was defiant, reasserting China’s claim to sovereignty over the South China Sea “since ancient times,” the   People’s Daily reported. His remarks echoed a statement from the Foreign Ministry. The tribunal’s decision “is invalid and has no binding force,” the ministry said. “China does not accept or recognize it. ” The foreign secretary of the Philippines, Perfecto Yasay Jr. welcomed the ruling as “significant” and called on “all those concerned to exercise restraint and sobriety. ” The five judges and legal experts on the tribunal ruled unanimously, and the decision was so heavily in favor of the Philippines that there were fears about how the Chinese leadership would react. Many in the region worry that Beijing will accelerate its efforts to assert control over the South China Sea, which includes vital trade routes and fishing waters as well as possible oil and mineral deposits. “Xi Jinping has lost face here, and it will be difficult for China to do nothing,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “I expect a very tough reaction from China, since it has lost on almost every point. There is virtually nothing that it has won. ” The Philippines filed its case in 2013, after China seized a reef over which both countries claim sovereignty. There has been speculation that Beijing might respond to the decision by building an artificial island at the reef, Scarborough Shoal, a move that could set off a conflict with the Philippines and its treaty ally, the United States. The State Department spokesman, John Kirby, said Washington expected China to comply with the ruling. “The world is watching to see if China is really the global power it professes itself to be and the responsible power that it professes itself to be,” he said. The main issue before the panel was the legality of China’s claim to waters within a “  line” that appears on official Chinese maps and encircles as much as 90 percent of the South China Sea, an area the size of Mexico. The Philippines had asked the tribunal to find the claim to be in violation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which both China and the Philippines have ratified. In its decision, the tribunal said any historic rights to the sea that China had previously enjoyed “were extinguished” by the treaty, which lays out rules for drawing zones of control over the world’s oceans based on distances to coastlines. The panel added that while China had used islands in the sea in the past, it had never exercised exclusive authority over the waters. The panel also concluded that several disputed rocks and reefs in the South China Sea were too small for China to claim control of economic activities in the waters around them. As a result, it found, China was engaged in unlawful behavior in Philippine waters, including activities that had aggravated the dispute. The tribunal cited China’s construction of a large artificial island on an atoll known as Mischief Reef. China has built a military airstrip, naval berths and sports fields on the island, but the tribunal ruled that it was in Philippine waters. The judges also said that Beijing had violated international law by causing “severe harm to the coral reef environment” and by failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from harvesting endangered sea turtles and other species “on a substantial scale. ” In an early indication of the regional response, Vietnam  —   which has fraternal Communist ties to China but also significant territorial disputes with it, including over oil exploration rights  —   quickly issued a statement endorsing the tribunal’s decision. China has argued that the tribunal had no jurisdiction in the case. Because the sovereignty of reefs and islands in the sea is disputed, Beijing asserted, the tribunal could not decide on competing claims to the surrounding waters. The treaty covers only maritime disputes, not land disputes. In a tough speech in Washington last week, a former senior Chinese official, Dai Bingguo, said that the findings would amount to no more than “waste paper” and that China would not back down from its activities in the South China Sea even in the face of a fleet of American aircraft carriers. But with the geopolitical stakes high, Mr. Dai also counseled moderation, saying that the situation in the South China Sea “must cool down. ” The issue could have ramifications for domestic politics in China. Mr. Xi has made defense of maritime claims a central part of the governing Communist Party’s narrative that it has restored the nation to global greatness after long periods of humiliation by bigger powers. Any challenge to that narrative is seen in Beijing as a challenge to the party’s rule. On Wednesday morning, an escalating propaganda campaign in China against the tribunal reached a new pitch, with all the major news outlets condemning the decision and trumpeting China’s refusal to be back down. “We do not claim an inch of land that does not belong to us, but we won’t give up any patch that is ours,” said a   editorial in The People’s Daily, which ridiculed the tribunal as a “lackey of some outside forces” that would be remembered as a “laughingstock in human history. ” Some Chinese commentators have said in recent days that the leadership may respond with immediate military maneuvers in the South China Sea. “Whether it will be significant or large scale I cannot say,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. China is hosting the Group of 20 summit meeting in September, a major international forum that it hopes will proceed without the distraction of conflict. But Mr. Shi said he was not sure the government had “that kind of patience” to wait until after the gathering before taking some sort of action. In a surprising opinion article on the India Today website over the weekend, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, Shen Dingli, wrote that Beijing needed to “revise its stance” and “employ a more effective approach” that maintained China’s “  ‘smiling’ image. ” The new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has signaled that he will be more accommodating toward China than was his predecessor, Benigno S. Aquino III. The case before the tribunal was filed at the initiative of Mr. Aquino, whose term ended June 30. Soon after the case was filed, China began building artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago, much of which is claimed by the Philippines, in a move that many saw as a demonstration of contempt for the international court system. Experts in international law said that negotiations could be the most positive outcome of the case. In 1986, some noted, the United States ignored a ruling from the International Court of Justice that declared its mining of the harbors of Nicaragua to be illegal. Washington had not ratified the Convention on the Law of the Sea, and it still has not. But the ruling 30 years ago by the judges in The Hague emboldened congressional critics to cut funds for the Reagan administration’s campaign against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, and it galvanized countries in Central America to seek a settlement of the conflict. China is not expected to vacate or dismantle the artificial islands it has built. That makes the legal arguments important, analysts said. “ “The tribunal rulings will move the goal posts towards the Philippines and the smaller countries,” said Markus Gehring, a lecturer in law at Cambridge University. In Manila, the former foreign secretary, Albert F. del Rosario, who brought the case after years of failed negotiations with China, said the path was now open for a lasting settlement of disputes in the South China Sea. “The award provides a basis to further talks and cooperation to encompass all parties, including China,” he said.",0
20622,20622,U.S. Ends Corruption Case Against Former Virginia Governor - The New York Times,Alan Blinder,"The Justice Department said Thursday that it would abandon its case against Robert McDonnell, a former governor of Virginia, whose career was upended by a corruption conviction that the United States Supreme Court overturned in June. Federal prosecutors also said that they would end an associated case against Mr. McDonnell’s wife, Maureen. The decisions, made public in filings to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, effectively concluded a political, legal and filial drama that mesmerized and embarrassed Virginia, where the McDonnells were accused of a criminal bargain with a dietary supplements executive. “After carefully considering the Supreme Court’s recent decision and the principles of federal prosecution, we have made the decision not to pursue the case further,” the Justice Department said in a   statement after the filings were submitted. The terse end to the matter was, in some ways, expected after the Supreme Court ruled for Mr. McDonnell, a Republican, in June and narrowed the range of behavior that qualifies as public corruption. The court’s ruling did not guarantee the close of Mr. McDonnell’s legal problems  —   until Thursday, it was unclear whether prosecutors would seek to retry him under the tapered standard  —   but it was a reassuring one for him and his supporters. “We have said from the very first day that Bob McDonnell is an innocent man,” his lawyers, Henry W. Asbill and Noel J. Francisco, said in a statement. “After a long ordeal traversing the entire legal system, that truth has finally prevailed. We are thrilled Governor McDonnell can finally move on from the nightmare of the last three years and begin rebuilding his life. ” The lawyers added that they believed the Justice Department had “brought this case in good faith based on its view of the law as it existed at the time. ” Ms. McDonnell’s lawyer, William A. Burck, issued a similar statement: “We thank the Department of Justice for the care with which they reviewed the case. We are thrilled and thankful that Maureen can now move on with her life. ” The McDonnells were charged in 2014, soon after Mr. McDonnell left office, in an indictment that presaged a sensational trial in Richmond, the Virginia capital. During the   trial, prosecutors depicted the former first couple as materialistic to the point of corruption because they accepted luxury gifts and   loans from Jonnie R. Williams Sr. who sought the governor’s help in advancing his business interests. The benefits and gifts, including a Rolex, designer clothes and financial aid for a daughter’s wedding, were worth more than $175, 000. Although the gifts were allowed under Virginia law, prosecutors successfully argued to a jury that the McDonnells, whose legal fates were often seen as intertwined, had violated federal anticorruption statutes. A judge later sentenced Mr. McDonnell to two years in prison, and Ms. McDonnell to a little more  than a year. Corruption experts were divided Thursday about whether the Justice Department’s decisions reflected a new approach to corruption cases in the wake of the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision. “The Department of Justice views this decision as having a material effect on the way they’ve been prosecuting quid pro quo cases in the past,” said Anthony M. Capozzolo, a former federal prosecutor, who interpreted the McDonnells’ decisions as “a sign that they’re going to handle these cases differently. ” Still, others noted the extent to which prosecutorial decisions hinge on the facts and circumstances of specific cases. “When a new legal standard is articulated by the Supreme Court and there’s a need to potentially retry the case, prosecutors make a very particularized assessment as to whether, No. 1, they can still convince a jury of the individual’s guilt under the new standard, and, two, whether it’s in the interests of justice,” said Arlo   a former chief of the public corruption unit in the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan. Mr. McDonnell’s lawyers did not say in Thursday’s statement whether the former governor might try to resuscitate a political career that had spawned speculation about a presidential bid. But an August poll commissioned by The Washington Post suggested that Mr. McDonnell would face a daunting political landscape in the commonwealth, with some   of respondents saying that he should not seek office again.",0

Set from a decidedly female perspective, “The Book of Night Women” takes you into domestic spaces, seduces you into understanding the very real conflicts and emotions behind charged and savage sexual encounters between slaves and masters, and dissects the negotiations of power within those relationships. “Regarding the Pain of Others,” Susan Sontag A very slim volume, “Regarding the Pain of Others” is a quick, yet painful read that allows you to deeply delve into empathy, a commodity that is doubtless lacking in our current national conversation. “The Queen of Harlem,” Brian Keith Jackson As Harlem, the perpetual work in progress, continues to change, it’s refreshing to revisit this book by my dear friend Brian Keith Jackson. “The Queen of Harlem” sets the stage of a neighborhood that was very familiar to me as I left Yale and discovered New York for the first time. “African Metropolitan Architecture,” David Adjaye The narrative around contemporary Africa’s cosmopolitan cities  —   exciting young people, vibrant artists and rapidly evolving promise  —   is, happily, becoming increasingly familiar to people around the globe. In this amazing book, Adjaye looks at architectural spaces across the continent, dividing it into regions defined by climates and cultures, rather than artificially derived national boundaries. Here the Maghreb, the desert, the Sahel, the forest, the Savanna and grasslands, and the mountains and high fields, are the defining features of how different architectures throughout Africa can be witnessed. “How Pleasure Works,” Paul Bloom Like artists of all stripes, I have attempted to analyze and justify my practice. The creative life, at its best, elucidates and thrives within pleasure: its absence, its expectation and its promise. Bloom’s book isn’t a   on life, but rather a cold, disciplined stare into the machinery of pleasure as it relates to human consciousness. “White Trash,” Nancy Isenberg Undergirding so much of the discourse surrounding resentment in America right now is the conversation about race. While the notion of “blackness” is often at the forefront of such discussions, the idea of “whiteness” is frequently left unexamined. In her surprising new book, Isenberg goes into the history of how the “white trash” identity is directly related to social caste and economic realities that are perpetually unacknowledged in American castings of itself, its character and its history. “White Trash” is at once informative, painful and enlightening in how complex our obsession with       has evolved. “Race and the Enlightenment: A Reader,” Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze One of my favorite reads from those fundamental years of art school, I first discovered this book when trying to come to terms with western Enlightenment culture’s broad impact on ideation in artistic practice. So much of Enlightenment thinking is poisoned by prior notions of race that one must ask: Is it ever possible to separate some of our greatest understandings derived from the Enlightenment era from its problematic history? In “Race and the Enlightenment,” Eze examines foundational writings on race by major Enlightenment figures and lays bare the toxic notions of their time in their own words. “Love in the Time of Cholera,” Gabriel García Márquez “Love in the Time of Cholera” is not a love story, but more a treatise on the subject of love in all its many forms. Márquez’s brilliant storytelling here is a joy, transforming the mundane realities of a long marriage into moments to be savored and relished. The intimate discoveries and daily bonds of marriage are at once thoroughly human, relatable, as well as spiritually transcendent.",0

What you see in public is the same thing I see in private. Do they feel responsibility because they’re historic figures? Yes, they do. But I don’t think it has made them be different than who they are. The president prides himself on the fact that his administration hasn’t had a scandal and he hasn’t done something to embarrass himself. That is not because he is being someone other that who he is.

20630,20630,Unpythonic,Remy Porter,"Remy escaped the enterprise world and now works as a consultant. Editor-in-Chief for TDWTF. 
From : Kirby McCloy Subject : Concerns about SMERPS The SMERPS project seems to be going down the wrong path. I thought our quarterly goal was for IT modernization. 
The email carried no specific call to action. It barely had a point, and was little more than bad-natured griping. It also came from Kirby, the CTO. The email triggered a four-alarm underpants fire as every manager on the SMERPS project tried to guess what Kirby might possibly mean. 
Someplace between the frenzied cries of, “Chris, did you see Kirby’s email? How do we reply?” someone had the bright idea that maybe this was just politics. Maybe Kirby just wanted to feel like he was part of the process, that his input was valued. They could just schedule a little sit-down, with Kirby, the PMs, and a few of the lead developers, and smooth this whole thing over. 
Thus, Brittany found herself with an entire Friday afternoon blocked off for a meeting. None of the large conference rooms were available, which meant three PMs, the project coordinator, and four developers had to cram into a small office to review the plan. Thirty minutes into the meeting, they were all huddled around the projector for warmth, and the CTO was a no-show. 
That didn’t dissuade management from trying to keep the meeting on track. “Well, while we wait for Kirby,” Chris said, “we can make sure we’re all on the same page. Let’s review the current plan.” 
For the next two hours, the PMs nattered on about critical paths, resource leveling, and project milestones that were already unlikely to bear any resemblance to reality, and would only slip farther with each new bit of overmanagement. Brittany was nearly asleep when Chris called her name. “Why don’t you tell us about the technical side for the web team?” 
“Well,” Brittany said, “SMERPS is a pretty straightforward CRUD app.” She noticed the vaguely surprised and offended look among some of the PMs and quickly explained, “Create-read-update-delete. A basic data-management tool.” The application needed to be accessible from the corporate office, at manufacturing sites, and at customer locations, and work on mobile devices. “All in all, it’s very similar to apps like RDR, TPM, and PlusPoint, so we’re planning to use the same tech-stack.” 
Specifically, SQL Server for the database, C# for the backend services, and Angular2 and Typescript on the front-end. A good stretch of the project could be scaffolded out with automated tools, and most of the rest could be lifted from other projects. The hard parts- the 10% of the code that’d take 90% of the time to build- were the places where it needed to talk to the ERP system. 
Brittany was in the process of making this explanation when Kirby swept into the room. “Sorry I’m late,” he said, “and I can’t stay long. But I have a few issues I’d like this team to address. First, there are a lot of resources on this project. I want you to be lean. There should be one developer on this project.” 
“That’s impossible,” Brittany said. 
The CTO rolled right over her. “It is if you’re using the right tools. Before this meeting, I did a little research, and did you know that Python is the number two programming language in the world? We’re going to use that for this project, which should make our developer more efficient.” 
This statement was greeted with silence and a vaguely shell-shocked look. The CTO took this for agreement, rapped his knuckles on the table, and said. “Great. Good. Get on that. Email me with any questions. Now, if you’ll excuse me…” What a Python might look like 
As the door closed behind Kirby, Chris stepped up. “Okay, so you heard what the CTO suggested. Let’s not go making any big decisions just yet. Scott, Lisa, I need you to write up a clearer picture of the ERP side of the project, and why we need multiple ERP developers. Larry, Bob- you do the same for the web team. Brittany, before you leave for the day, I need you to do an alternatives analysis that compares our current tech with Python. Be objective and fair, but… well…” 
“Well,” indeed. Brittany had no real opposition to Python as a language, but definitely did not like the idea of making a massive shift just on a CTO’s whims. She focused her analysis on a few key points. First, no one in their organization actually knew Python. Their entire portfolio was some flavor of .NET and the newer projects had added Angular. Their entire toolchain, build-process, continuous integration process, etc., all were built to support C# and Angular projects. Even beyond that, Python didn’t perform as well as C#, and since the requirements wanted a single-page application, they’d need to use Angular anyway , so there was no getting rid of Angular. 
Brittany did her best to be thorough. That was easy. Being polite was harder. She was working late on Friday night to get the document over to Chris, who was also working late. When she hit send, he instantly replied to her with a big “THANKS!”. She went home, and ignored work until Monday. 
On Monday, there was an email from Chris. “Got a meeting with Kirby at 11AM. Will follow up after.” 
At 11:15, Brittany got an email from Kirby. “Saw your analysis,” he wrote, “but with 1 hour of research, I can disagree with it. Angular and TypeScript is old. Python is new, and Google is writing everything with it. Python is the best practices for development.” 
The project was put on hold while everyone tried to talk some sense into Kirby. Kirby was adamant, though: he read that Google used Python, and so Initech also needed to use Python. “If our team still needs to use Angular, just use the Python version,” were his final words on the subject. 
Brittany pulled Chris aside. “Chris, does Kirby even know what Python is? He clearly doesn’t know what Angular is. What happens if we just say, ‘Yes, we’ll use Python ,’ and then… don’t?” 
And that’s how Brittany completed her first major development project in Python, although it didn’t actually contain a single line of Python code.

20631,20631,‘Here Lies’: A Clue in Hebrew Points to Rome’s Medieval Jewish Cemetery - The New York Times,Elisabetta Povoledo,"ROME  —   Excavations that unearth some artifact or another are common enough in Rome, but archaeologists monitoring a building restoration were taken aback when they found 38   skeletons that they believe were once buried in the   Campus Iudeorum, or Field of the Jews. Scholars knew that Jews were buried in the Trastevere neighborhood of Rome from 1363 to 1645, when the cemetery was moved to make room for new city walls, but the recovery of the remains was the first tangible sign  —   at least in recent times  —   of one section of the burial site near the Tiber River. “We didn’t understand who the skeletons could have belonged to at first,” because there were no markers to explain their provenance, said Daniela Rossi, an archaeologist who oversaw the dig, which began six years ago when work began on the renovation of a building from the early 20th century. So the archaeologists scrutinized historical maps showing the cemetery, and, using carbon dating technology, they estimated that the skeletons were from the   to the   century, which also coincided with the dates the cemetery existed. Except for two women who were buried wearing gold rings, and a man buried with a scale, the corpses had been buried without funerary goods, “which is typical of Jewish funerary practices,” Ms. Rossi said. Further proof came via a fragment of travertine marble found nearby with Hebrew writing unmistakably associated with a cemetery. “The characters read ‘here lies,’” said Alessio De Cristofaro, one of the archaeologists involved in the excavation. “All the elements converged to identify this as the Campus Iudeorum. ” Jews first came to Rome in the second century B. C. and for centuries many inhabited the Trastevere neighborhood, said Claudio Procaccia, the director of the culture department for the Jewish Community of Rome. Though Jews were forcibly confined to a ghetto under Pope Paul IV in 1555, living in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions in a constantly flooding area on the opposite side of the river from Trastevere, in previous centuries “the condition of Jews in Rome was more acceptable than in other cities,” Mr. Procaccia said. In 1645, when Pope Urban VIII built new city walls, the cemetery was moved to the Aventine Hill, where Jews were buried until 1934. Tombs were upended during the construction of the walls, but the cemetery may already have been despoiled after Urban VIII in 1625 decreed that Jews had to be buried in unmarked graves, while   gravestones had to be destroyed. The skeletons showed signs of malnutrition, but Ms. Rossi said that such malnourishment was typical of   citizens of the time, regardless of their religion. Trastevere was once a seaport, and was mostly populated by artisans, traders, and warehouse hands of different religions and communities, “a working class that worked physically and subsisted on a   diet,” she said. The excavation was documented and the skeletons will be entrusted to Rome’s Jewish community, which will “bury them in more correct form or, say, manner,” Mr. Procaccia said. As archaeologists dug deeper, they also found the monumental foundations of tanneries  —   the   Coraria Septimiana  —   built in the third century by the emperor Septimius Severus to equip the Roman Army, as well as various artifacts and animal bones.",0
20632,20632,Social Justice Attorney Andrea Burton: Jailed for Refusing to Remove Black Lives Matter Lapel Pin,Bill Quigley,"Tweet Widget by Bill Quigley 
A young Black lawyer from Youngstown, Ohio, had to sue a judge who held her in contempt of court for wearing a Black Lives Matter pin. The judge said his decision had nothing to do with politics. “The local NAACP chapter questioned that assertion and wondered whether the Judge would have jailed Burton if she was wearing a ‘Support the Troops’ pin.” Atty. Andrea Burton ultimately agreed to wear her pin in the courthouse, but not in the courtroom. Social Justice Attorney Andrea Burton: Jailed for Refusing to Remove Black Lives Matter Lapel Pin by Bill Quigley 
“To remain neutral becomes an accomplice to oppression.” 
Andrea Burton, a 30 year old Ohio criminal defense lawyer, was rocketed onto the national social justice scene this summer after she was handcuffed and jailed for refusing to take off a Black Lives Matter pin while in court. 
Burton’s stance received international attention . “I think that you can’t remain silent or you remain a party to oppression,” she told The Washington Post . “I am usually a pretty agreeable person. I’m always smiling. I’m polite. I have manners. But at some point it eats away at you how any time people see you talk about Black Lives Matter, then you’re being sensitive, you’re the person who’s racist.” In interviews with local media Burton insisted “I'm not anti-police, I work with law enforcement and I hold them in the highest regard, and just to say for the record, I do believe all lives matter. But at this point they don't all matter equally."" 
The Black Lives Matter pin was about one inch across , the size of a nickel . Burton refused an order to remove the Black Lives matter pin by Youngstown Ohio Judge Robert Milich . Burton told the Judge she was asserting her First Amendment rights . “I said I’m respecting my first amendment right, that I’m not neutral to injustice, and to remain neutral becomes an accomplice to oppression.” The judge held her in contempt of court, jailed her and sentenced her to five days. After being jailed for five hours and the NAACP was called in to help, the judge released Burton pending an appeal of his decision. 
Judge Milich, who was already famous for announcing his refusal to perform any marriages on the day the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same sex marriage, told the media that his own personal opinions had nothing to do with the decision. The local NAACP chapter questioned that assertion and wondered whether the Judge would have jailed Burton if she was wearing a “Support the Troops” pin. When asked by The Daily Beast , whether he would jail a lawyer for wearing a pin that said Support Our Troops, he refused to say. “I can’t speculate on what a political pin might be until I look at it. I just used the definition in the Black’s Law Library Dictionary, and the standard dictionary of what’s political.” The Judge further muddied the waters when he said “There’s a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pin that’s on a political issue.” 
“Burton told the Judge she was asserting her First Amendment rights.” 
Burton paid a high price for her convictions. After she was jailed, Burton, who had been previously regularly appointed to represent numerous Youngstown Municipal criminal defendants , said she was “frozen out” of the appointment process for representing criminal defendants and received no appointments at all. 
Burton then filed a federal civil rights damages actio n against Judge Milich, the other Youngstown Municipal Judge, and the City of Youngstown for violations of her constitutional rights to Freedom of Speech, Due Process and Equal Protection. In the civil rights case, filed in the Northern District of Ohio, Burton pointed out police officers were in the same courtroom with black tape over their badges and the judge did nothing to them. After court monitored settlement discussions, Burton agreed to drop her federal civil rights case. In return the Judge agreed to drop her contempt charge. Burton said she will continue to wear her BLM pin in the courthouse but not inside the courtroom. Further, the settlement provided that local judges agreed not to retaliate against her and will fully consider her requests for future appointments to court-appointed cases. 
Who is this brave lawyer? 
Beginnings 
Burton grew up in Youngstown, Ohio in a family active in the civil rights movement. “My grandfather marched on Washington with Martin Luther King ,” said Burton. “He was a good friend of A. Phillip Randolph . He protested in the South during the Civil Rights Movements and attended the 1963 March on Washington. He was one of the first black Councilpersons for Youngstown. My mother was pretty active in the black awakening during the 60s. She was fairly militant about civil rights as a teen and was what we know now as a feminist.” 
Some of her courage is no doubt due to her upbringing. Burton’s older brother was born with a rare genetic disorder that left him mentally disabled and very sickly as a child. Dad operated a successful business despite addiction issues until his death when Burton was 15. Mom, a legal secretary and later a court bailiff, did heroic work caring for the family. 
“My mother’s compassion and dedication greatly influenced how empathetic I have become. She pushed me greatly to do more than what was expected, to excel when it would be simpler to be typical. She never told me that there was anything I could not do if I set my sights on achieving it. She worked hard to make the resources available to me if I actually wanted them. Both my parents were college educated. Both were heavily invested in learning. 
“My parents never really treated me as a child so I was often exposed to difficult realties and frank conversations. I was conscious of the ways people were different (i.e., gender, orientation, race, or class) but how it did not matter at all in determining their worth.” 
Studies 
Burton always did well in school. “I was expected to be a good student. My father was relentless about math grades and performances especially. I won a sport in the Junior Statesman Program at Georgetown University to study government when I was 16 years old. It was a highly competitive program that included people from all over the world. 
Burton earned a scholarship and graduated from Youngstown State University in 2008 in pre-law and journalism. She was awarded another scholarship to study for her Masters in Library and Information Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . 
“I decided to become a lawyer as I finished my bachelor’s degree.” So after she received her graduate degree she returned to Ohio and commuted from home to attend the University of Akron School of Law . “The best part of law school was working in the legal clinic.” There she wrote appellate briefs for prisoners, provided legal research to inmates, handled applications for clemency to the governor and other pro bono services to low income individuals. She took social justice classes when she could and wrote a major paper on Kelley Williams-Bolar who was convicted of a felony for enrolling her children in another better school district. “I wanted to study why anyone would commit a felony to educate their kids, why was it necessary? What differences where there?” 
“She wrote appellate briefs for prisoners, provided legal research to inmates, handled applications for clemency.” 
After becoming a lawyer, Burton began a small private practice and spent a lot of her time working as a public defender. “It was a shock,” Burton admits. “People with power and influence held some bigoted ideas. People were not treated fairly and it was quite disheartening. 
“As a criminal defense lawyer, I am motivated by humanity, compassion and the oath I took to uphold the Constitution of the United States. I am often asked how I could represent those accused of crimes, some heinous crimes. I see criminal defense work as an opportunity to make sure that the promise that the criminal justice system makes “innocent until proven guilty” is followed. Getting convictions and imparting justice are two very different things. My job is to make sure that statutes and rules are followed to guarantee a fair and impartial trial. Politics should not factor into that. I am merely an instrument of justice but I take my role extremely seriously. 
“It is sometimes challenging to work with other attorneys and people in the justice system who are oblivious to the discrepancies people of color and impoverished people experience within the system that is set up to eradicate those inequities. I am also disappointed in people who accept the status quo just because it is easy and convenient. We need to be willing to continually re-evaluate our role in furthering injustice. 
Justice 
“Justice sometimes comes slowly, through time, by the changing of minds through understanding and experience. Other times it is the result of tumultuous uncertain revolutions. The problem with maintaining justice is that often we only recognize what justice is by seeing injustice. Sometimes the world needs a major event, a major catalyst to stir change. That process is often frightening. To me, living in a world where we value some more than others is unjust. Especially when some are undervalued to the point that people are systematically dying. When people are too afraid to have an informed dialogue about how factors intersect to create injustice that perpetuates injustice. Willful blindness in the face of a wealth of information is the greatest threat to civilization today. 
Sustainability 
“One of the ways I sustain myself is that I read continuously. I read philosophy as well as political and spiritual texts. I have a close friend that I speak with virtually every week. He has been a savior for me since I was 17 years old. We understand each other because we are both avid readers, with similar interests in philosophy and in that we both have always felt a sense of isolation and disconnection from our peers. This is important because I think that more and more people feel a sense of disconnect from the world despite the many connections created through social media. 
“When someone asks me for a book recommendation, I suggest Strength to Love by Martin Luther King Jr. It is a religious book, but I do not read it simply for the Christian aspects of it. I read it because it’s empowering, powerful and because King was an extremely smart compassionate person and it shows. I also read Nietzsche religiously. 
“I am involved in the YWCA which is dedicated to eliminating racism, empowering women and promoting peace, justice, freedom and dignity for all. 
“My dream is that differences in color would actually be as relevant as shoe size and that religious fanaticism would disappear.” 
Advice to Law Students 
“Learn to see value in every human being and truly read the papers that are the foundation of this Country. Study and understand the Constitution and The Federalist Papers . They demonstrate how this democracy was formulated. Know your history because it shapes today in ways you will never appreciate fully otherwise. Be prepared to examine yourself for your own conflicts in logic and your own biases. Learn how lawyers can become accomplices to injustice, even if unintentionally. 
Role Models 
“ Harriet Tubman , Sojourner Truth , Alexander Hamilton , W.E.B Du Bois , Langston Hughes , James Baldwin , Gandhi , Malala Yousafzai , Martin Luther King , A. Phillip Randolph , Rosa Parks , Thurgood Marshall , Ralph Abernathy , and Joseph Lowery inspire me. Malcolm X of course. And our President Barack Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama . I am also inspired by the countless individuals who face oppression and injustice in their lives daily but continue to work toward a better world. I am inspired by those who fight for those who are limited in power or face nearly insurmountable odds. I think the work of those individuals is the key to making the world a place where love conquers hate and fear. 
Conclusion 
“The day I wore that button and was found in contempt changed my life, the effect of it are still rippling, some in destructive ways and others in very inspiring ways. I wore it because my soul was so tired from all the inequities I had seen over my 4 years of practice. I was exhausted from losing a series of small battles for understanding for my vulnerable clients. I was tired of the indifference of the prosecutorial offices. And all I could think to do was wear this button for a little joy. For a small win. To hope to change someone’s mind. Bill Quigley teaches law at Loyola University New Orleans.",1

20634,20634,Senate Takes Major Step Toward Repealing Health Care Law - The New York Times,Thomas Kaplan and Robert Pear,"WASHINGTON  —   Senate Republicans took their first major step toward repealing the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, approving a budget blueprint that would allow them to gut the health care law without the threat of a Democratic filibuster. The vote was 51 to 48. During the roll call, Democrats staged a highly unusual protest on the Senate floor to express their dismay and anger at the prospect that millions of Americans could lose health insurance coverage. One by one, Democrats rose to voice their objections. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington said that Republicans were “stealing health care from Americans. ” Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said he was voting no “because health care should not just be for the healthy and wealthy. ” The presiding officer, Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, repeatedly banged his gavel and said the Democrats were out of order because “debate is not allowed during a vote. ” The final vote, which ended just before 1:30 a. m. followed a marathon session in which senators took    roll call votes on numerous amendments, an arduous exercise known as a   . The approval of the budget blueprint, coming even before   Donald J. Trump is inaugurated, shows the speed with which Republican leaders are moving to fulfill their promise to repeal President Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement  —   a goal they believe can now be accomplished after Mr. Trump’s election. The action by the Senate is essentially procedural, setting the stage for a special kind of legislation called a reconciliation bill. Such a bill can be used to repeal significant parts of the health law and, critically, is immune from being filibustered. Congress appears to be at least weeks away from voting on legislation repealing the law. Republicans say the 2016 elections gave them a mandate to roll back the health care law. “The Obamacare bridge is collapsing, and we’re sending in a rescue team,” said Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. “Then we’ll build new bridges to better health care, and finally, when these new bridges are finished, we’ll close the old bridge. ” Republican leaders say they will work closely with Mr. Trump developing legislation to repeal and replace the health care law, but it is unclear exactly how his team will participate in that effort. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he would offer his own plan to repeal and replace the law “essentially simultaneously. ” He said he would put forth the plan as soon as his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, is confirmed. The Affordable Care Act has become ingrained in the American health care system, and unwinding it will be a formidable challenge for Republicans. More than 20 million people have gained coverage under the law, though premiums have risen sharply in many states and some insurers have fled the law’s health exchanges. The budget blueprint instructs House and Senate committees to come up with repeal legislation by Jan. 27. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, and four other Republicans had sought to extend that deadline by five weeks, to March 3. But late Wednesday night, Mr. Corker withdrew an amendment that would have changed the date. “We understand that everyone here understands the importance of doing it right,” he said. He described the Jan. 27 date in the budget blueprint as a placeholder. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, another Republican who sought to delay the deadline, said: “This date is not a date that is set in stone. In fact, it is the earliest we could do it. But it could take longer, and we believe that it might. ” The House was planning to take up the budget blueprint once the Senate approved it, though some House Republicans have expressed discomfort with voting on the blueprint this week because of lingering questions over how and when the health care law would be replaced. A vote on the measure in the House could come on Friday. In its lengthy series of votes, the Senate rejected amendments proposed by Democrats that were intended to allow imports of prescription drugs from Canada, protect rural hospitals and ensure continued access to coverage for people with   conditions, among other causes. In the parlance of Capitol Hill, many of the Democrats’ proposals were “messaging amendments,” intended to put Republicans on record as opposing popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act. The budget blueprint is for the guidance of Congress it is not presented to the president for a signature or veto and does not become law. As the Senate plowed through its work on Wednesday, Republicans explained why they were determined to dismantle the health care law, and they tried to assuage concerns about the future of coverage for millions of Americans. “This is our opportunity to keep our campaign promise,” said Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi. “This is our opportunity to help the   and the vice   keep their campaign promises and show to the American people that elections have consequences. ” Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, said that while working to repeal the health care law, “we must also talk about what we replace it with, because repealing it without a replacement is an unacceptable solution. ” Republicans do not have an agreement even among themselves on the content of legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, the timetable for votes on such legislation or its effective date. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said on Wednesday that she agreed with Mr. Trump that Congress should repeal the health law and adopt a replacement plan at about the same time. “But I don’t see any possibility of our being able to come up with a comprehensive reform bill that would replace Obamacare by the end of this month,” she said. “I just don’t see that as being feasible. ” (Ms. Collins also supported pushing back the deadline to come up with repeal legislation.) As Republicans pursue repealing the law, Democrats contend that Republicans are trying to rip insurance away from millions of Americans with no idea of what to do next. The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, called the Republicans’ repeal plan “irresponsible and rushed” and urged them to halt their push to unravel the law. “Don’t put chaos in place of affordable care,” he said.",0

Haley visited vocational classes and a supermarket where   are used to charge accounts as a way to cut down on fraud. Outside the camp, she also visited a U. S.  school where Syrian and Jordanian girls can get an education and a border crossing between Jordan and Syria.  One of the reasons we traveled to Jordan is to see firsthand how the Syrian crisis is affecting children. pic. twitter.   —   Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) May 22, 2017,  pic. twitter.   —   Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) May 21, 2017,  During the trip, Haley will also visit parts of Turkey and will meet with government and UN officials, as well as heads of NGOs. The trip will focus on the Syrian refugee crisis both countries are on the front line of the crisis and share borders with the imperiled country. The Trump administration has eyed deep cuts to funding for the controversial UN, but Haley sought to combat the narrative that those cuts would hurt those most in need. According to McClatchey, Haley told reporters that the U. S. was “not pulling back” from the crisis and was in fact “engaging more. ”  The Trump administration’s policy on the crisis, particularly President Trump’s executive order on immigration, has attracted the criticism of members of foreign governments, including figures in the United Nations. In an address to the League of Arab States in March, UN   Antonio Guterres said it “breaks my heart to see developed countries closing their borders to refugees fleeing this region, and worse, sometimes invoking religion as a reason to keep them out. ” But Haley has already gained a reputation for standing up to the UN. On multiple occasions, she has blasted the body’s   bias. In March, she demanded a UN report calling Israel an “apartheid state” be withdrawn  —   which it was. In April, when Bolivia requested a   session of the UN Security Council in the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, Haley denied the request. “Any country that chooses to defend the atrocities of the Syrian regime will have to do so in full public view, for all the world to hear,” she said, also blasting the “empty words” of other members of the council. Haley foreshadowed her defense of the U. S. policy in an   last week for The Wall Street Journal. In it, Haley defended the U. S. saying “The U. S. is doing more than anyone. ” Talking about how she was heckled at an international women’s conference in April, she argued that “those who accuse the U. S. of heartlessness in the face of this crisis are wrong. ” “No country has invested more in protecting, housing, feeding and caring for Syrian refugees than the U. S. We have provided nearly $6. 5 billion in emergency assistance for Syria since the start of the crisis. Inside Syria, some four million people benefit from U. S. assistance for essentials like food and shelter every month,” Haley wrote. Haley said she would bring attention to U. S.  food programs on her trip to Turkey and Jordan, including programs that deliver aid to Syrians still trapped in the country. “With American help, Syria’s neighbors have made the difference between life and death for millions of Syrians. The U. S. and the UN will continue to do a great deal of heavy lifting for these desperate people,” she wrote. Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.

20637,20637,Fitton: Judicial Watch Pursues James Comey Records,Tom Fitton,"The swamp creatures in Washington who gamed the system to appoint a special prosecutor need to be held accountable. [Judicial Watch is focusing on James Comey, the former FBI director who spirited away government documents, then arranged for the contents of those documents to be leaked to the media to force the appointment of a special prosecutor.  We aim to get the bottom of both the records’ removal and the leaks to the media, then hold accountable the persons involved.  Just today, we sued the Justice Department, which oversees the FBI, for a key Comey memo.  The lawsuit seeks access to a memorandum Comey wrote after a private meeting with President Trump regarding the pending investigation of Gen. Mike Flynn and potential Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election (Judicial Watch v. U. S. Department of Justice (No. 1:  )). We filed the suit here in D. C. after the Department of Justice failed to respond to our May 16 FOIA request: The memorandum written by former Director James Comey memorializing his meeting and conversation with President Trump regarding the FBI’s investigation of potential Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election. For purposes of clarification, this memorandum was reportedly written on or about February 13, 2017 and is the subject of a New York Times article   …     dated May 16, 2017. The memo purportedly recounts a conversation between Trump and Comey about Flynn. Judicial Watch is pursuing six FOIA lawsuits (see here, here, here, here, here, and here) related to the surveillance and unmasking of President Trump’s associates during the FBI investigation of potential Russian involvement and the subsequent leaking of information about that investigation to the media. Having to sue to get a document that was leaked to the New York Times is a scandal. The memo should be released forthwith, and, frankly, the president can and should order its immediate release. The lawsuit was only one of several significant actions we took this week. Yesterday, we sent acting FBI Director Andrew G. McCabe a letter reminding him about the FBI’s legal obligation under the Federal Records Act (FRA) to recover records removed from the agency, including Comey’s memos, apparently taken by Comey when he left the FBI and subsequently leaked them to the media. My June 14 letter states: As you are well aware, former FBI Director James Comey gave sworn testimony last week before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Among other things, Mr. Comey confirmed that, while in office, he created various memoranda regarding his meetings with President Trump. Mr. Comey also confirmed that, after his departure from the FBI, he provided at least some of these memoranda to a third party, Columbia Law School Professor Daniel Richman, for the purpose of leaking them to the press. Various media outlets now have reported that Professor Richman has provided these memoranda to the FBI. It is unclear whether he still retains copies of the memoranda. I am writing to you on behalf of Judicial Watch, Inc. a    educational organization that seeks to promote transparency, accountability, and integrity in government and fidelity to the rule of law. In furtherance of its public interest mission, Judicial Watch regularly requests access to the records of the FBI through the Freedom of Information Act and disseminates its findings to the public. In fact, on May 16, 2017, Judicial Watch submitted a FOIA request seeking these specific memoranda removed from the FBI by Mr. Comey. Judicial Watch also has pending FOIA lawsuits in which the memoranda may be at issue. These memoranda were created by Mr. Comey while serving as FBI director, were written on his FBI laptop, and concerned official government business. As such, they indisputably are records subject to the Federal Records Act. 44 U. S. C. §§       and  . The fact that Mr. Comey removed these memoranda from the FBI upon his departure, apparently for the purpose of subsequently leaking them to the press, confirms the FBI’s failure to retain and properly manage its records in accordance with the Federal Records Act. Even if Mr. Comey no longer has possession of these particular memoranda, as he now claims, some or all of these memoranda may still be in possession of a third party, such as Professor Richman, and must be recovered. Mr. Comey’s removal of these memoranda also suggests that other records may have been removed by Mr. Comey and may remain in his possession or in the possession of others. If so, these records must be recovered by the FBI as well. As you may be aware, the Federal Records Act imposes a direct responsibility on you to take steps to recover any records unlawfully removed from the FBI. Specifically, upon learning of “any actual, impending, or threatened unlawful removal, defacing, alteration, corruption, deletion, erasure, or other destruction of records in the custody of the agency,” you must notify the Archivist of the United States. 44 U. S. C. § 3106. Upon learning that records have been unlawfully removed from the FBI, you then are required to initiate action through the Attorney General for the recovery of records. Id. In the event you fail to take these steps, you should be aware that Judicial Watch is authorized under the law to file a lawsuit in federal district court seeking that you be compelled to comply with the law. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Kerry, 844 F. 3d 952, 955 (D. C. Cir. 2016) Armstrong v. Bush, 924 F. 2d 282, 296 (D. C. Cir. 1991). Please advise us no later than June 26, 2017 if you intend to take the action required under the law. If we do not hear from you by that date, we will assume that you do not intend to take any action. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Mr. Comey left the FBI with government records, and the FBI and Justice Department are obligated to get them back. If they don’t, we may sue to try to force them to do so.",0
20638,20638,Teacher Shows Up For Field Trip Drunk; Gets 75 Grand Settlement,C.E. Dyer,"You are here: Home / US / Teacher Shows Up For Field Trip Drunk; Gets 75 Grand Settlement Teacher Shows Up For Field Trip Drunk; Gets 75 Grand Settlement October 27, 2016 Pinterest 
There are many things wrong with the educational system in America, and this story is evidence of a big one. A teacher in Wisconsin sued the city of Janesville after she showed up to a field trip drunk. She claimed that she was emotionally distressed after the police released her blood alcohol level test results. 
Fox News reported : 
A former elementary school teacher who passed out after showing up drunk to a bowling alley field trip is getting a $75,000 settlement from the Wisconsin city she sued. 
The ex-teacher, Maria Caya, filed a $5.5 million lawsuit against the city of Janesville last year claiming police improperly released her blood alcohol tests, Fox 6 reported . The city council approved the settlement Monday night. 
Investigators said her blood alcohol percentage was 0.27 percent on the day of the field trip in June 2013. The legal limit for driving in Wisconsin is 0.08 percent. 
Another staff member took Caya to the hospital after finding her passed out in the bowling alley bathroom, WKOW reported . As many as eight other adults were chaperoning the group of 4th graders. 
Aside from the teacher’s $75,000 settlement, she also received $18,000 to resign because district officials noted that it would have cost more in legal fees to actually fire her. 
For that you can thank the teachers’ unions, who have a stranglehold on the American educational system. Forget protecting the kids, let’s make it difficult for the school district to fire a teacher who allegedly passed out drunk on a field trip. 
Fox News reported that despite the settlement, it’s not clear whether or not she actually broke any laws. 
Jens Jorgensen, one of seven Janesville City Council members who opposed the settlement, told Fox 6: “I think that there’s a lot of things that happened that day and I would think that a judge and jury of her peers would be able to see through all of that and make the correct decision on that.” 
Christine Nimmo, a parent, said of the situation: “She put our children in jeopardy.” 
If Maya did what she is alleged to have done, then she absolutely put the children in jeopardy, and this story is a prime example of why our schools are failing. Thanks to the teachers’ unions, bad teachers stick around because schools are afraid of expensive legal action. 
On the flip side, good teachers are chased out and can’t do their job effectively because of fear of legal action in our overly-litigious, politically-correct society.

20639,20639,"2nd Avenue Subway Will Open on Jan. 1, M.T.A. Says - The New York Times",Emma G. Fitzsimmons,"After nearly a century of delays and disappointment, the first phase of the Second Avenue subway is finally opening to the public on Jan. 1, officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said on Monday. Trains will begin to run on the new line at noon on Jan. 1, 2017, the authority said in a statement. At an event to reveal the artwork at the new stations, the authority’s chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, invited the crowd to ride the line on opening day. “I think you’ll find the art there exhilarating,” Mr. Prendergast said. “I think you’ll find the environment vastly different than what you see in the New York City subway, and you’ll be pleased I think with the end product. ” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has been pressing officials to open the line by the end of the year, said local leaders would take a ceremonial ride on the Second Avenue line on New Year’s Eve and perhaps toast the opening of the   project with champagne. But Mr. Prendergast fumbled the   announcement of an opening date, saying in the morning that the line would open at 6:04 a. m. on Jan. 1. A statement from the authority came later in the afternoon, correcting the start time and leading some to joke on Twitter that the project had been delayed yet again  —   by about six hours. A spokeswoman for the authority, Beth DeFalco, said the chairman misspoke and that 6 a. m. was in fact when trains would run on the first weekday it was open on Jan. 2. The new subway route is an extension of the Q line, which currently ends near the southern edge of Central Park at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue. Starting in January, Q trains will travel to an upgraded station at Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street and to three new stations at 72nd, 86th and 96th Streets. Planning for a Second Avenue subway line has advanced in fits and starts for decades. The first phase to 96th Street, which cost about $4. 4 billion, will be the most ambitious expansion of New York City’s subway system in a  . Over the weekend, the Second Avenue stations began to appear on subway maps on trains in New York City. The first phase is expected to initially carry about 200, 000 riders each day and will ease overcrowding on the crowded No. 4, 5, and 6 lines along Lexington Avenue, officials said. The first Q train will leave the station at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, heading uptown to the new stations, at noon on Jan. 1, the authority’s statement said. Trains will run every six minutes during peak hours. For the first week, trains will run only between 6 a. m. and 10 p. m. Overnight service will start on Jan. 9. The authority, which is effectively controlled by Mr. Cuomo, had set a deadline to open the first phase of the line by Dec. 31, but delays with escalators and elevators threatened to push back the date. Officials at the authority said workers were able to finish final testing at the stations more quickly than they expected. The authority is in the initial planning stages for the second phase of the line, which would extend it to 125th Street in Harlem. But the project will cost billions of dollars and take years to build, and plans to extend the line south to Lower Manhattan are less certain. Officials first announced plans for a Second Avenue line in 1929, but the Great Depression halted that effort. In another push in the 1970s, several groundbreakings were held, but the work was stopped when the city nearly went bankrupt. The latest campaign began in the 1990s, and construction began again in 2007. Gene Russianoff, the longtime leader of the Straphangers Campaign, a riders advocacy group, has witnessed many of the false starts and delays over the years. He is looking forward to visiting the new stations, along with the crowds of transit enthusiasts who are expected to flock there in January. “For subway buffs, this is like the Grand Canyon,” he said. “There’s a lot of it, and there’s a lot to explore. ”",0
20640,20640,Sweden Top Cop on No Go Zones: Europe’s Open Borders ’Has Brought Crime Here’,Oliver JJ Lane,"A Swedish police officer is now being investigated for pointing out that migrants are responsible for many crimes in his country, but a retired senior colleague has also spoken out on the phenomenon and called out Europe’s open borders for increasing crime in the formerly peaceful nation. [Breitbart London spoke to recently retired Swedish police officer Torsten Elofsson in 2015 as his heavily resettled home city of Malmo was experiencing a serious spike in attacks committed by migrant communities with smuggled hand grenades.  The former INTERPOL officer and director of Swedish criminal intelligence division said the population of the city, which has been the first point of entry for tens of thousands of illegal migrants as they moved north through Europe into Scandinavia, had gone up by 50 per cent in two decades but the number of officers to police it had halved. Senior cop Elofsson told Breitbart: Sweden became a member of the European Union in 1995 and opened our borders. We are part of the Schengen treaty, so you have that freedom of movement which has also brought criminality here  …     Gun and drug related crime has definitely increased. Until recently the possession of guns by criminals was very rare  —   now finding people with firearms is a daily occurrence here  …     most of the guns we seize are used in criminal activity, are held illegally, and are smuggled into Sweden. Slovakia is very interesting right now  —   it is very easy to buy deactivated guns there but they are converted back when they are imported here. Malmo is infamous for explosions. Yet thankfully nobody has been killed by the explosions yet  —   some of them are just used to frighten people. We had one case in Rosengard where a group were given a court order to leave an apartment because they were a disturbance for the neighbours. And then suddenly hand grenades and explosions outside the office of the real estate company. Explaining the rise of populist,   migration parties like the Sweden Democrats Mr Elofsson said normal voters were starting to realise the rosy picture painted by centrist politicians didn’t tally up with their everyday experiences. He said:   …    the politicians, the media sends out a message that everything is safe and secure, you don’t have to worry. But people act according to their own experience  —   they see things, they experience things, they talk to their neighbours. And they feel the picture being presented in the media is not entirely accurate. Many people think the media and the politicians have merged together to make people believe that it is safe and sound to live here, and there are no problems. The media says immigration is always a positive thing because we have an ageing population and we need a young workforce to come from other countries. People don’t buy that picture 100 per cent. Living here you can see a lot of the crimes are committed by people originating abroad. Look at the unemployment here  —   you have 15 per cent in Malmo, which is twice the rest of Sweden. Of the number of people arrested and dragged into police stations, the majority are of foreign origin to be honest. There is an   of violent crimes committed by people from other countries. But you can’t fool people. And that’s why the Sweden Democrats are rising. It was 25 per cent last week, now it is 27. There is a debate happening, you see all of the refugees coming  …     but we don’t have apartments, housing for them. How do we provide schooling for them? And then you see the costs. There is a feeling we can’t afford an influx of immigrants.   ‘No go zones’ have been a hotly contested topic in the debate surrounding mass migration to Europe, with some activists strongly denying their existence. Whether the Swedish state admitted the fact or not, Elofsson said he’d experienced them in Malmo, and they made policing a more difficult job. He told Breitbart: We have a number of    in Sweden and they are expanding  …     police can go to these places, but you have to take precautions. Years ago you could go with two officers, no problem. Now you have to send four officers and two cars  —   if the fire brigade want to go, they have to take a police escort. They throw stones and try to stop the fireman from putting out fires. They sabotage the police cars. You can’t leave them unguarded  —   when you come back to it you find the windows smashed and the tyres deflated. It isn’t quite a   zone, but we have had to develop special routines to go there. The comments last week of serving Swedish Police officer Peter Springare, made in an exasperated Facebook post about what he called a clear link between migrants and crime levels are all the more unusual for having come from a serving officer. While he is now under investigation by his own force for “incitement to racial hatred” he at least has the support of one Swedish academic who too has spoken out. As reported by Breitbart London Thursday, Criminology Professor Leif GW Persson appeared on a Swedish television and said “There is a strong prevalence of criminal immigrants. It is so obvious when it comes to crimes of this nature. Very serious violent crime  …     Yes, I have made the same observation  …     anyone with eyes to see can know who is doing these kinds of actions”.

20641,20641,State Secrets Privilege Invoked to Block Testimony in C.I.A. Torture Case - The New York Times,"James Risen, Sheri Fink and Charlie Savage","The Trump administration has invoked executive powers in a bid to block the testimony of several top C. I. A. officials in a federal lawsuit against two psychologists who helped run the agency’s harsh interrogation program, along with portions of 172 internal agency documents. Hoping to prevent the officials, including Gina Haspel, the agency’s new deputy director, from being forced to testify, the administration is using the state secrets privilege, which means the executive branch is asking the judge in the case to keep information out of court by asserting that its disclosure would damage national security. The government rarely tries to use the extraordinary power, and this is among the first assertions of it by the Trump administration. At an earlier phase of the case in Federal District Court in Spokane, Wash. the Obama administration did not invoke the privilege  —   although in court filings last year, it did leave the door open to doing so at a later stage. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by two former detainees at C. I. A. secret prisons overseas and the representative of a third man who died in custody. If they prevail in the suit against the former military psychologists, James E. Mitchell and Bruce Jessen, who helped devise and run the interrogation program, it would be the first time an American civilian court has held anyone accountable for a role in developing counterterrorism policies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The two former prisoners say they suffered lasting harm from their treatment at C. I. A. “black sites,” secret interrogation and detention centers that it operated overseas. Suleiman Abdullah Salim, a Tanzanian who may have been a victim of mistaken identity, was held in a darkened C. I. A. prison in Afghanistan and subjected to beatings, hanging in chains, sleep deprivation, and water dousing, which involves pouring ice water over detainees to create a sensation of drowning, according to a Senate report and interviews with him. Mohamed Ahmed Ben Soud, a Libyan also held in Afghanistan, who was likewise mentioned in the Senate report, described being slammed against a wall, shackled to the ceiling, locked in wooden boxes and also subjected to the ice water treatment. The third man, an Afghan named Gul Rahman, died in 2002 in a secret C. I. A. prison in Afghanistan after being left nearly naked and shackled to a wall in the cold. Lawyers for Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen have clashed with the Justice Department over what classified evidence is needed to defend against the lawsuit’s allegations that the two men designed and put in place “an experimental torture program. ” Their lawyers argue that the psychologists were contractors acting under C. I. A. direction, so they should be considered government agents entitled to protection from civil lawsuits. Lawyers for the former prisoners have said that they do not need any classified information to make their case, and they are instead relying on declassified documents, including the executive summary of the 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report that condemned the agency’s use of torture, including the use of waterboarding and other agonizing techniques. Complicating matters, in the military commissions system at Guantánamo Bay, defense lawyers for a detainee who was tortured in C. I. A. custody are seeking courtroom testimony by Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen. The detainee, Abd     is accused of helping orchestrate the 2000 bombing of the American destroyer Cole off the coast of Yemen and could face the death penalty if convicted. In December, Mr. Nashiri’s lawyers, who are trying to get the case thrown out, asked the military judge to order pretrial testimony from the two psychologists, as well as the C. I. A. ’s former top lawyer, John Rizzo, and the former chief of the Counterterrorism Center of the C. I. A. José Rodriguez Jr. in connection with the destruction of videotapes showing Mr. Nashiri being waterboarded. On Tuesday, The Miami Herald reported that the military judge had authorized the defense lawyers to call four former C. I. A. officials as witnesses. But it was not clear whether that testimony would be public. The ruling, which was not yet available, was said to have identified them only as witnesses A, B, C and D. In the civil lawsuit in federal court in Spokane, the judge had already approved requests for oral depositions of Mr. Rizzo and Mr. Rodriguez. But the lawyers for the defendants have sought testimony from more C. I. A. officials. In June 2016, the defendants asked to depose James Cotsana, a former C. I. A. official who they said oversaw their activities, but the agency refused to allow him to testify. In December, the defendants issued subpoenas to depose two other agency employees: Ms. Haspel, who was initially described in court papers as “Gina Doe,” and a still unidentified official described as “  Doe,” Mr. Cotsana’s successor as chief of special missions for the C. I. A. ’s counterterrorism center and chief of the C. I. A. ’s renditions group. After the C. I. A. announced on Feb. 2 that Ms. Haspel was President Trump’s choice as the agency’s deputy director, a lawyer for Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen reminded the government of the subpoenas. The defendants said in their filings that Ms. Haspel, who ran one of the C. I. A. ’s secret detention sites, was “centrally involved in the events alleged” by the plaintiffs. The defense has also asked for dozens of documents from the C. I. A. and the Justice Department. In a declaration and formal claim of privileges, the C. I. A. director, Mike Pompeo, said it was necessary to keep certain information secret, including the identities of agency personnel who participated in the program, whom he said have been the subject of “death threats and security incidents. ” He acknowledged that there had been “public speculation” that Ms. Haspel and Mr. Cotsana been involved in the program, but said the agency had never officially confirmed whether that was true, and “the absence of official confirmation from the C. I. A. leaves an important element of doubt about the veracity of the information and, thus, carries with it an additional layer of protection and confidentiality. ” He added: “That protection would be lost, however, if the government were forced to confirm or deny the accuracy of speculation or unauthorized disclosures,” so “the agency could not permit these individuals to answer any questions pertaining to the program. ” The court gave the government until Wednesday to assert any claims of privilege or the state secrets doctrine. Now it will be up to the Federal District Court judge, Justin L. Quackenbush, to determine whether the state secrets privilege and other privileges claimed by the government were properly invoked to block that testimony and, if so, whether the case can go forward despite those restrictions. The government did not seek dismissal of the case. It is set for trial on June 26. “This case has shown that the claims of C. I. A. torture survivors are not too secret for our courts to handle,” said Dror Ladin, a staff lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which, with the Gibbons law firm in Newark, represents the former detainees. “Whether or not the government’s new state secrets claims are upheld, there’s already more than enough evidence in the record for our clients to prove their case. ” This month, the Trump administration invoked the state secrets privilege in a federal lawsuit involving a classified contract. But the Obama administration had already invoked the privilege in an earlier stage of that dispute when the lawsuit was before a state court. The state secrets privilege became controversial under the Bush administration, which frequently invoked it to block lawsuits related to the C. I. A. interrogation program and the N. S. A. ’s warrantless surveillance program. The government’s growing use of the power prompted civil liberties advocates to accuse the administration of abusing the privilege to prevent judiciary scrutiny of executive branch wrongdoing. In 2009, after the Obama administration took office, the Justice Department created a task force to review all pending cases it had inherited in which the Bush administration had invoked the privilege. Led by Donald B. Verrilli Jr. who later became the solicitor general, the task force found that each of the invocations was legitimate. However, Mr. Verrilli put together a more restrictive process for deciding whether to invoke the privilege in the future. It required the attorney general personally to sign off before the department could do so. While the Obama administration did not invoke the privilege as frequently as the Bush administration had done, it did make some use of it. The first instance came in September 2010 in response to a lawsuit filed by the father of Anwar   an American citizen and radical cleric for Al Qaeda’s Yemen branch, seeking an injunction against attempts to kill his son. A federal judge dismissed that lawsuit on technical grounds, so there was no ruling on whether the invocation of the privilege was legitimate. The United States killed Mr. Awlaki a year later in a drone strike.",0

It can now be read on the internet by visiting RadioFreePalestine.org.uk . Despicable Balfour: A Story of Betrayal – Part 1 By Stuart Littlewood on October 29, 2016 by Stuart Littlewood 
November 2 marks the centenary of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which began the still-ongoing colonisation of Palestine and sowed the seeds of an endless nightmare for the Palestinian people, both those who were forced to flee at gunpoint and those who have managed to remain in the shredded remains of their homeland under Israel’s brutal military occupation. 
A movement called the Balfour Declaration Centenary Campaign is urging action and wants an apology. “We call on the international community and all peace and justice loving people to join the campaign to call on the Government and Parliament of the United Kingdom to: 
1 Reject the Balfour Declaration including its role as an instrument of displacement and dispossession of the Palestinian people; 
2 Issue an official apology to the Arab Palestinian people for their role in issuing the Balfour Declaration and making possible the displacement and dispossession of the Palestinian people 
3 Acknowledge their historic, legal and moral responsibility for damages sustained as a result of the implementation of the Balfour Declaration 
4 Institute reparations to the Palestinian people in accordance with the provisions and principles of international law, justice and equity, which guarantee the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to their homeland and the right of self-determination.” 
A Century of Ethnic Cleansing and Denial of Palestinian Rights A seventeen-year-old girl trembling with grief and rage told me how she witnessed her teenage cousin being shot through the head by Israeli soldiers. They had been walking to school together and the soldiers were taunting him. In response he had picked up a rock. She accused me and all Americans of knowing about these daily abuses against Palestinians but not caring. I tried to tell her that most Americans do not know about these tragedies, and that we would never support those who perpetrate them. But her belief that the average American is savvy about international politics was as strong as it was naive. “Of course Americans know we’re suffering over here,” she retorted.“You’re the most powerful nation on earth. And everyone has a television. I know you know.” 
These words are from David Hazard’s excellent book Blood Bothers , which charts the life of Father Elias Chacour, a remarkable Christian Palestinian who grew up on the shores of Galilee and saw his beautiful world shattered by the Israeli occupation. Like countless others he was made a refugee in his own country. 
Americans aren’t alone in ignorance of their complicity. British people too seem largely unaware of how tragedy was allowed to overtake the Palestinians, and how this once-peaceful province of the Ottoman Empire, renowned for its antiquities and culture, became a land scarred by conflict, where everyday the humiliation of illegal occupation stokes the fires of hatred. You cannot get in or out, or move around, without running the gauntlet of Israeli customs, baggage searches, roadblocks and checkpoints under the sneer of contemptuous, sunglassed troops. Even in remote countryside you’ll run into one of six or seven hundred armed checkpoints. And that’s what visitors have to put up with. Imagine what it’s like for residents. 
The Israeli Defence Force is largely made up of National Servicemen and women – teenagers drafted in and trained to use lethal force. They have a reputation for being trigger-happy. Of course, they don’t all wish to play the thug or necessarily agree with their orders. 
The truth about Palestine doesn’t sit well with Britain’s now crumbling reputation for fair play. Its name has been airbrushed from maps and purged, like a dirty word, from the diplomatic lexicon. Even today the subject is only haphazardly taught in our schools. For older generations like mine it was never on the curriculum. To understand why, one must at least dip a toe into the complicated history of the last 100 years. To help readers over this hurdle, I offer this ‘potted’ version. At least it will explain why, ten years ago, I went to see Palestine for myself. For centuries long our land enslaved by Turkish kings with sharpened blade. We prayed to end the Sultan’s curse, the British came and spoke a verse. “It’s World War One, if you agree to fight with us we’ll set you free.” The war we fought at Britain’s side, our blood was shed for Arab pride. At war’s end Turks were smitten, our only gain, the lies of Britain. 
Stephen Ostrander’s simple verse manages to cut through a mountain of rhetoric to the root cause of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
There was a Jewish state in the Holy Land some 3,000 years ago, but the Canaanites and Philistines were there first. The Jews, one of several invading groups, left and returned several times, and were expelled by the Roman occupation in 70AD and again in 135AD. Since the 7th century Palestine has been mainly Arabic. During the First World War the country was ‘liberated’ from Turkish Ottoman rule after the Allied Powers, in correspondence between Sir Henry McMahon and Sharif Hussein ibn Ali of Mecca in 1915, promised independence to Arab leaders in return for their help in defeating Germany’s ally. 
At the same time, however, a new Jewish political movement called Zionism was finding favour among the ruling élite in London, and the British Government was persuaded by the Zionists’ chief spokesman, Chaim Weizman, to surrender Palestine for their new Jewish homeland. Hardly a thought, it seems, was given to the earlier pledge to the Arabs, who had occupied and owned the land for 1,500 years – longer, say some scholars, than the Jews ever did. 
The Zionists, fuelled by the notion that an ancient Biblical prophecy gave them the title deeds, aimed to push the Arabs out by inserting millions of Eastern European Jews. They had already set up farm communities and founded a new city, Tel Aviv, but by 1914 Jews numbered only 85,000 to the Arabs’ 615,000. The infamous Balfour Declaration of 1917 – actually a letter from the British foreign secretary, Lord Balfour, to the most senior Jew in England, Lord Rothschild – pledged assistance for the Zionist cause with apparent disregard for the consequences to the native majority. Calling itself a “declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations”, it said: 
“His Majesty’s Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing and non-Jewish communities….” 
Balfour, a Zionist convert, later wrote: 
“In Palestine we do not propose even to go through the form of consulting the wishes of the present inhabitants of the country. The four powers are committed to Zionism and Zionism, be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in age-long tradition, in present needs, in future hopes, of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now occupy that land.” 
There was opposition. Lord Sydenham warned: “The harm done by dumping down an alien population upon an Arab country may never be remedied. What we have done, by concessions not to the Jewish people but to a Zionist extreme section, is to start a running sore in the East, and no-one can tell how far that sore will extend.” 
The American King-Crane Commission of1919 thought it a gross violation of principle. “No British officers consulted by the Commissioners believed that the Zionist programme could be carried out except by force of arms. That, of itself, is evidence of a strong sense of the injustice of the Zionist programme.” 
There were other reasons why the British were courting disaster. A secret deal, called the Sykes-Picot Agreement, had been concluded in 1916 between France and Britain, in consultation with Russia, to re-draw the map of the Middle Eastern territories won from Turkey. Britain was to take Jordan, Iraq and Haifa. The area now referred to as Palestine was declared an international zone. The Sykes-Picot Agreement, the Balfour Declaration and the promises made earlier in the McMahon-Hussein letters all cut across each other. It seems to have been a classic case of the left hand not knowing what the right was doing in the confusion of war. 
Some distinguished Jews opposed a ‘national home’ in Palestine 
After the Russian Revolution of 1917 Lenin released a copy of the confidential Sykes-Picot Agreement into the public domain, sowing distrust among the Arabs. Thus the unfolding story had all the makings of a major tragedy. Subsequent crimes – on both sides – flow from this triple-cross. The Zionist organization asked permission to submit its proposal for Palestine to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, hitching a ride on the British request to be granted a mandate over Palestine in order to implement the Balfour Declaration. The Zionist case included the statement that “the land itself needs redemption. Much of it is left desolate. Its present condition is a standing reproach. Two things are necessary for that redemption – a stable and enlightened government, and an addition to the present population which shall be energetic, intelligent, devoted to the country, and backed by the large financial resources that are indispensable for development. Such a population the Jews alone can supply.” 
Prominent US Jews opposed to this move handed President Woodrow Wilson a counter-statement objecting to the Zionists’ plan, and asked him to present it to the peace conference. It said the scheme to reorganise the Jews as a national unit with territorial sovereignty in Palestine “not only misrepresents the trend of the history of the Jews, who ceased to be a nation 2000 years ago, but involves the limitation and possible annulment of the larger claims of Jews for full citizenship and human rights in all lands in which those rights are not yet secure. For the very reason that the new era upon which the world is entering aims to establish government everywhere on principles of true democracy, we reject the Zionistic project of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine.” 
Foreseeing the future with uncanny accuracy, it went on to say, “We rejoice in the avowed proposal of the Peace Congress to put into practical application the fundamental principles of democracy. That principle, which asserts equal rights for all citizens of a state, irrespective of creed or ethnic descent, should be applied in such a manner as to exclude segregation of any kind, be it nationalistic or other. Such segregation must inevitably create differences among the sections of the population of a country. Any such plan of segregation is necessarily reactionary in its tendency, undemocratic in spirit and totally contrary to the practices of free government, especially as these are exemplified by our own country.” 
The counter-statement quoted Sir George Adam Smith, a noted biblical scholar and the acknowledged expert on the region, who had said: “It is not true that Palestine is the national home of the Jewish people and of no other people… It is not correct to call its non-Jewish inhabitants ‘Arabs’, or to say that they have left no image of their spirit and made no history except in the great Mosque… Nor can we evade the fact that Christian communities have been [there] as long as ever the Jews were… These are legitimate questions stirred up by the claims of Zionism, but the Zionists have not yet fully faced them”. 
America, England, France, Italy, Switzerland and all the most advanced nations of the world, it said, are composed of representatives of many races and religions. “Their glory lies in the freedom of conscience and worship, in the liberty of thought and custom which binds the followers of many faiths and varied civilizations in the common bonds of political union…. A Jewish State involves fundamental limitations as to race and religion, else the term ‘Jewish’ means nothing. To unite Church and State, in any form, as under the old Jewish hierarchy, would be a leap backward of two thousand years. 
Tasked with dispossessing Palestinians and expanding the Jewish State… Israeli troops: teenage gunslingers sometimes friendly, sometimes not. All the time I was aware of a third guard nearby with a gun on my back. 
“We ask that Palestine be constituted as a free and independent state, to be governed under a democratic form of government recognizing no distinctions of creed or race or ethnic descent, and with adequate power to protect the country against oppression of any kind. We do not wish to see Palestine, either now or at any time in the future, organized as a Jewish State .” 
But Wilson apparently failed to put the document before the Conference. 
In 1922 the League of Nations placed Palestine under British mandate, which incorporated the principles of the Balfour Declaration. Jewish immigration would be facilitated “under suitable conditions” and a nationality law would allow Jews taking up permanent residence to acquire Palestinian citizenship (in sharp contrast to the Jews-only law now operated by a dominant Israel). But the high commissioner was soon recommending a halt to Jewish immigration for fear that it would create a class of landless Arabs. That same year the British government, aware of Arab concerns that the Balfour Declaration was being interpreted in an “exaggerated” way by Zionists and their sympathisers, issued a White Paper to clarify the position. 
“The terms of the Declaration referred to,” it said, “do not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded ‘in Palestine’. In this connection it has been observed with satisfaction that at a meeting of the Zionist Congress, the supreme governing body of the Zionist Organization, held at Carlsbad in September, 1921, a resolution was passed expressing as the official statement of Zionist aims the determination of the Jewish people to live with the Arab people on terms of unity and mutual respect, and together with them to make the common home into a flourishing community, the upbuilding of which may assure to each of its peoples an undisturbed national development… 
“It is also necessary to point out that the Zionist Commission in Palestine, now termed the Palestine Zionist Executive, has not desired to possess, and does not possess, any share in the general administration of the country. Nor does the special position assigned to the Zionist Organization in Article IV of the Draft Mandate for Palestine imply any such functions. That special position relates to the measures to be taken in Palestine affecting the Jewish population, and contemplates that the organization may assist in the general development of the country, but does not entitle it to share in any degree in its government. 
“Further, it is contemplated that the status of all citizens of Palestine in the eyes of the law shall be Palestinian, and it has never been intended that they, or any section of them, should possess any other juridical status. 
“It is necessary,” said the White Paper with masterly ambiguity, “that the Jewish community in Palestine should be able to increase its numbers by immigration. This immigration cannot be so great in volume as to exceed whatever may be the economic capacity of the country at the time to absorb new arrivals. It is essential to ensure that the immigrants should not be a burden upon the people of Palestine as a whole, and that they should not deprive any section of the present population of their employment.” 
However, the White Paper flatly denied that a promise had been made to the Arabs ahead of the Balfour Declaration. “It is not the case, as has been represented by the Arab Delegation, that during the war His Majesty’s Government gave an undertaking that an independent national government should be at once established in Palestine. This representation mainly rests upon a letter dated the 24th October, 1915, from Sir Henry McMahon, then His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Egypt, to the Sharif of Mecca, now King Hussein of the Kingdom of the Hejaz. That letter is quoted as conveying the promise to the Sharif of Mecca to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories proposed by him. But this promise was given subject to a reservation made in the same letter, which excluded from its scope, among other territories, the portions of Syria lying to the west of the District of Damascus. This reservation has always been regarded by His Majesty’s Government as covering the vilayet of Beirut and the independent Sanjak of Jerusalem. The whole of Palestine west of the Jordan was thus excluded from Sir Henry McMahon’s pledge. 
“Nevertheless, it is the intention of His Majesty’s government to foster the establishment of a full measure of self-government in Palestine . But they are of the opinion that, in the special circumstances of that country, this should be accomplished by gradual stages…” 
From then on, the situation would go from bad to worse. Despicable Balfour: A Story of Betrayal – Part 2 

November 2 marks the centenary of the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which began the still-ongoing colonisation of Palestine and sowed the seeds of an endless nightmare for the Palestinian people. The UK Government needs to make amends for its crimes against the Holy Land. Campaigners are calling on it to apologise. 
Part 2 continues the Story of Betrayal…. 
In 1937 the Peel Commission declared that British promises to Arabs and Zionists were irreconcilable and unworkable. Too late, Britain dropped its commitment to the Zionists and began talking about a Palestinian state with a guaranteed Arab majority and protection for minorities. 
The Zionists reacted furiously. Their underground military wing, the Haganah, and other armed groups, unleashed a reign of terror in the run-up to World War II. They continued their attacks on the British after the war and tried to bring in hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees. 
In 1946 they blew up the south wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, which housed the British mandatory government, killing 91. This terrorist act was ordered by David Ben-Gurion in retaliation for the arrest of Haganah, Irgun and Stern Gang members suspected of attacks on the British. He then thought better of it and cancelled the operation but Menachem Begin, who led the Irgun, went ahead. Both Ben-Gurion and Begin, who had a big price on his head as a wanted terrorist, became Israeli prime ministers. 
Throughout this period the United States were reluctant to allow Jews fleeing Europe to enter the empty spaces of North America, preferring to play the Zionist game and see them funnelled into Palestine. In 1945 the new US president, Harry Truman, offered Arabs this excuse: “I am sorry, gentlemen, but I have to answer to hundreds of thousands of those who are anxious for the success of Zionism; I do not have hundreds of thousands of Arabs among my constituents.” 
However, Truman was frequently exasperated by the Zionist lobby and on one occasion had a delegation thrown out of the White House for their table-thumping antics. He wrote: “I fear very much that the Jews are like all underdogs. When they get on top they are just as intolerant and cruel as the people were to them when they were underneath.” 
American author Gore Vidal provided an intriguing insight. “Sometime in the late 1950s, that world-class gossip and occasional historian, John F. Kennedy, told me how, in 1948, Harry S. Truman had been pretty much abandoned by everyone when he came to run for president. Then an American Zionist brought him two million dollars in cash, in a suitcase, aboard his whistle-stop campaign train. ‘That’s why our recognition of Israel was rushed through so fast.’ As neither Jack nor I was an antisemite (unlike his father and my grandfather) we took this to be just another funny story about Truman and the serene corruption of American politics.” 
By now this monster Britain had breathed life into, was running out of control. The Arabs, tricked and dispossessed, were outraged. The collision has been fatally damaging to the West’s relationship with Islam ever since. As the violence escalated, Gandhi was moved to comment: “Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English. They (the Jews) have erred grievously in seeking to impose themselves on Palestine with the aid of America and Britain and now with the aid of naked terrorism.” 
With the mandate about to expire in 1948 an exhausted Britain handed over the problem to the United Nations and prepared to quit the Holy Land, leaving a powder-keg with the fuse fizzing. The newly-formed UN thought it would save the situation by partitioning Palestine into Arab and Jewish states and making Jerusalem an international city. But this gave the Jews 55 percent of Palestine when they accounted for only 30 percent of the population. The Arab League and the Palestinians of course rejected it. Map 1: 1947 UN Partition of Palestine Under the UN Partition Plan the Jews received 55% of the country (including both Tel Aviv/Jaffa and Haifa port cities, the Sea of Galilee and the resource-rich Negev) although they accounted for only a third of the population (548,000 out of 1,750,000) and owned only 6% of the land. The Jewish community accepted the Partition Plan; the Palestinians (except those in the Communist Party) and the Arab countries rejected it. 
The UN Partition of Palestine never did stand close scrutiny. At that time, as some commentators have pointed out, UN members did not include African states, and most Arab and Asian states were still under colonialist regimes. The UN was pretty much a white colonialist club. The Palestinians themselves had no representation and they weren’t even consulted. 
The first vote failed to reach the required two-thirds majority: 25 for partition, 13 against and 19 abstentions. To ensure success in the second vote a good deal of arm-twisting was applied to the smaller countries, but again it fell short. At the third attempt France was persuaded to come “on board” after the US threatened to withdraw desperately needed post-WW2 aid, and on November 29 the UN voted to partition Palestine into three parts: a Jewish state on 14,000 sq km with some 558,000 Jews and 405,000 Palestinian Arabs; and an Arab state on 11,500 sq km with about 804,000 Palestinian Arabs and 10,000 Jews. Jerusalem, including major religious sites, would be a ‘corpus separatum’, internationally administered. Map 2: Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories By the end of the 1948 war Israel controlled 78% of the country, including half the territory that had been allocated by the UN to the Palestinians. Around 750,000 Palestinians living in what became Israel were made refugees: only 100,000 remained in their homes. More than 418 villages (two-thirds of the villages of Palestine) were systematically destroyed by Israel after their residents had left or been driven out. The Arab areas were now reduced to 22% of the country, the West Bank was taken by Jordan and Gaza by Egypt. The 1949 Armistice Line (the “Green Line”) remains the de facto boundary of the State of Israel until today. Since 1988, when thePalestinians recognized Israel within that boundary, it has been the basis of the two-state option. 
This ludicrous carve-up was quickly followed by shameful incidents at Deir Yassin, Lod and Ramle. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs were uprooted from their homes and lands and to this day are denied the right to return. They received no compensation, and after their expulsion Jewish militia obliterated hundreds of Arab villages and towns. No sooner had Britain packed her bags than Israel declared statehood on 14 May 1948 and immediately set about expanding control across all of Palestine. 
The following day, 15 May, is remembered by Palestinians as the Day of al-Nakba (the Catastrophe), which saw the start of a military terror campaign that forced three-quarters of a million Palestinians from their homeland to make room for the new Jewish state. Some 34 massacres were allegedly committed in pursuit of Israel’s territorial ambitions. 
An event permanently etched on the Palestinian memory is the massacre at Deir Yassin by Zionist terror groups, the Irgun and the Stern Gang. On an April morning in 1948 130 of their commandos carried out a dawn raid on this small Arab town with a population of 750, to the west of Jerusalem. The attack was initially beaten off, and only when a crack unit of the Haganah arrived with mortars were the Arab townsmen overwhelmed. The Irgun and the Stern Gang, smarting from the embarrassment of having to summon help, embarked on a ‘clean-up’ operation in which they systematically murdered and executed at least 100 residents – mostly women, children and old people. The Irgun afterwards exaggerated the number, quoting 254, to frighten other Arab towns and villages. The Haganah played down their part in the raid and afterwards said the massacre “disgraced the cause of Jewish fighters and dishonoured Jewish arms and the Jewish flag”. 
Deir Yassin signaled the ominous beginning of a deliberate programme by Israel to depopulate Arab towns and villages – and destroy churches and mosques – to make room for incoming Holocaust survivors and other Jews. In any language it was an exercise in ethnic cleansing, the knock-on effects of which have created an estimated 4 million Palestinian refugees today. 
By 1949 the Zionists had seized nearly 80 percent of Palestine, provoking the resistance backlash they so bitterly complain about today. Many Jews condemn the Zionist policy and are ashamed of what has been done in their name. 
UN Resolution 194 had called on Israel to let the Palestinians back onto their land. It has been re-passed many times, but Israel is still in breach. The Israelis also stand accused of violating Article 42 of the Geneva Convention by moving settlers into the Palestinian territories it occupies, and of riding roughshod over international law with their occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. But expulsion and transfer were always a key part of the Zionist plan. According to historian Benny Morris no mainstream Zionist leader was able to conceive of future co-existence without a clear physical separation between the two peoples. David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister, is reported to have said: “With compulsory transfer we have a vast area (for settlement)…I support compulsory transfer. I don’t see anything immoral in it.” 
He showed astonishing candour on another occasion when he remarked: “If I were an Arab leader I would never make terms with Israel. We have taken their country. Sure, God promised it to us, but what does that matter to them? Our God is not theirs. We come from Israel, it is true, but 2,000 years ago, and what is that to them? There has been anti- Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They only see one thing: we have come here and stolen their country.” 
General Moshe Dayan, hero of the Six Day War (1967), made it known to Palestinians in the territories that “you shall continue to live like dogs, and whoever wishes, may leave, and we shall see where this process will lead.” That appears to have been the general attitude ever since. 
In 1967 Israel perceived a number of Arab threats designed to check Zionist ambitions, including a blockade of their Red Sea port. In a series of pre-emptive strikes against Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq, Israel succeeded in doubling the area of land under its control. 
Indeed, in the wake of the 1967 Six Day War Israel confiscated over 52 percent of the land in the West Bank and 30 percent of the Gaza Strip, violating both international law and the UN Charter, which says that a country cannot lawfully make territorial gains from war. It was reported that Israel demolished 1,338 Palestinian homes in the West Bank and detained some 300,000 Palestinians without trial. 
The UN issued Security Council Resolution 242, stressing “the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war” and calling for “withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict”. It was largely ignored, thus guaranteeing further discord in the region. 
Israel’s most notorious prime minister, Ariel Sharon, made a name for himself in 1953 when his secret death squad, Unit 101, dynamited homes and massacred 69 Palestinian civilians – half of them women and children – at Qibya in the West Bank. His troops later destroyed 2,000 homes in the Gaza Strip, uprooting 12,000 people and deporting hundreds of young Palestinians to Jordan and Lebanon. Then in 1982 he masterminded Israel’s invasion of Lebanon, which resulted in a massive death toll of Palestinians and Lebanese, a large proportion being children. An Israeli tribunal found him indirectly responsible for the massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra and Chatila refugee camps and removed him from office. But he didn’t stay in the background for long. 
By the end of 1967 there were just 3 illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem. By the end of 2005 the total was 177. “When we have settled the land,” the then chief of staff of the Israeli Defence Force, Rafael Eitan, remarked in 1983, “all the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle.” 
By 2015 there were 196 illegal Israeli settlements in addition to 232 settler outposts in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to the Applied Research Institute – Jerusalem, and upwards of 750,000 settlers residing there. 
Apartheid and occupation: “in practice there is little difference” 
So what sort of person was responsible for this misery and mayhem in the Holy Land – the “running sore” Lord Sydenham predicted? At Cambridge Arthur Balfour read moral sciences (no, seriously!). Much good it did the poor Palestinian Arabs he helped dispossess. 
Described as born lazy, aloof and having an attitude problem, he was convinced of his personal superiority and wished to keep the vulgar world at arm’s length. Balfour famously remarked: “Nothing matters very much, and few things matter at all.” 
He had been Prime Minister (1902-1905) and was regarded as weak. At the time of the Declaration blunder he was Foreign Secretary. In the words of one commentator Balfour’s career “stretches before our eyes in a flat and uneventful plain of successful but inglorious and ineffective self-seeking”. He was said to be a man who would make almost any sacrifice to remain in office. In this case, he sacrificed the Arab homeland. In 1922 the League of Nations put Palestine under British mandate, which incorporated the principles of the Balfour’s Declaration. 
How have things turned out? 
John Dugard, a professor of international law and former Special Rapporteur to the UN Human Rights Council on the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, explained on Aljazeera the differences and similarities between apartheid South Africa and apartheid Israel. 
http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/11/201111395153781378.html 
Of course, the regimes of apartheid and occupation are different. Apartheid South Africa was a state that practised discrimination against its own people. It sought to fragment the country into white South Africa and black Bantustans. Its security laws were used to brutally suppress opposition to apartheid. Israel, on the other hand, is an occupying power that controls a foreign territory and its people under a regime recognised by international law [as] belligerent occupation. 
However, in practice, there is little difference. Both regimes were/are characterised by discrimination, repression and territorial fragmentation (that is, land seizures). 
Israel discriminates against Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in favour of half a million Israeli settlers. Its restrictions on freedom of movement, manifested in countless humiliating checkpoints, resemble the “pass laws” of apartheid. Its destruction of Palestinian homes resembles the destruction of homes belonging to blacks under apartheid’s Group Areas Act. The confiscation of Palestinian farms under the pretext of building a security wall brings back similar memories. And so on. Indeed, Israel has gone beyond apartheid South Africa in constructing separate (and unequal) roads for Palestinians and settlers. 
Apartheid’s security police practised torture on a large scale. So do the Israeli security forces. There were many political prisoners on Robben Island but there are more Palestinian political prisoners in Israeli jails. 
Apartheid South Africa seized the land of blacks for whites. Israel has seized the land of Palestinians for half a million settlers and for the purposes of constructing a security wall within Palestinian territory – both of which are contrary to international law. 
Dugard suggested there is sufficient evidence for a legitimate enquiry into the question whether Israel violates the prohibition of apartheid found in the 1973 Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute. 
Sydenham’s “running sore” has been festering for a century, crippling the Middle East and turning the Holy Land into an abomination. Balfour and his fellow Zionist stooges in the corridors of British power clearly had no understanding of the true purpose and base methods of Zionism. 
This is also true of present-day Christian-Zionists. Some Christian churches have rejected Zionist doctrine as false teaching that corrupts the biblical message of love, justice and reconciliation. They deplore the cosy relationship between Christian Zionist leaders and the governments of Israel and the United States that impose their pre-emptive borders and domination over Palestine. And they condemn the teachings of Christian Zionism that support those policies as they encourage racial exclusivity and perpetual war. 
In other words, no Christian with a functioning brain cell should touch Zionism with a bargepole. Yet the upper echelons of our government and many Western churches are riddled with Zionist sympathisers. Unless they are smoked out, a hundred years from now an outraged civil society will still be calling for government apologies for the actions of that lunatic Balfour and his successors.

Accuracy in Media 
In one of her secret speeches, Hillary Clinton said, “My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders…” Before this comment was revealed, Adam Taylor of The Washington Post tried to assure everyone that the idea of a North American Union, like the meddlesome and bureaucratic European Union, was dead. Such talk, he said, emanated from “fringe websites” and “conspiracy theorists.” 
The Hillary speech was made to a Brazilian bank known as Itaú BBA, which describes itself as “Latin America’s largest Corporate & Investment Bank” and part of the Itaú Unibanco group, “one of the world’s largest financial conglomerates.” 
The problem for Taylor and other faux journalists is that there is a whole body of research on the topic of a “ North American Law Project ,” designed to integrate the legal systems of the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The project is run out of American University’s Center for North American Studies, where students can concentrate in North American Studies . As a matter of fact, such degrees are being offered by several different colleges and universities, including Canada’s McGill University . 
Passed in 1993, NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, began the process of harmonizing laws among the U.S., Canada and Mexico. But the Council on Foreign Relations admits that the U.S.-Mexico trade balance swung from a $1.7 billion U.S. surplus in 1993 to a $54 billion deficit by 2014. This has led to a loss of about 600,000 jobs. 
In addition to shipping jobs to Mexico, NAFTA constituted subversion of our constitutional system. President Clinton submitted NAFTA as an agreement, requiring only a majority of votes in both Houses of Congress for passage, and not a treaty, which would have required a two-thirds vote in favor in the Senate. NAFTA passed by votes of 234-200 in the House and 61-38 in the Senate. 
A money crash soon followed in 1995 as Mexico was hit by a peso crisis, and a U.S. bailout was arranged. Congress would not bail out Mexico, so Clinton arranged for loans and guarantees to Mexico totaling almost $40 billion through the International Monetary Fund and the “Exchange Stabilization Fund.” 
Meanwhile, pressure has been building for the creation of a “North American Community”—also known as a “North American Union”—with regular meetings involving the leaders of the three countries. On June 29, 2016, the Obama White House issued a fact sheet on this year’s “North American Leaders’ Summit.” It said, “The economies of the United States, Canada, and Mexico are deeply integrated. Canada and Mexico are our second and third largest trading partners. Our trade with them exceeds $1.2 trillion dollars annually.” 
The leaders of these countries agreed to establish a “North American Caucus” to “more effectively work in concert on regional and global issues by holding semi-annual coordination meetings among our foreign ministries.” One item on the agenda was for the leaders to reaffirm “North America’s strong support for [Colombian] President Santos’s efforts to finalize a peace accord with the FARC guerrillas.” That fell apart on October 2 when a “peace deal” with the communist terrorists was voted down by the people of Colombia. 
But notice how these leaders claim to speak for “North America.” 
Going global, they also declared, “North America is committed to joint and coordinated actions to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.” 
This is U.N.-speak for global taxes and other forms of foreign aid from the U.S. to the rest of the world. 
We noted in a column last year that the American people, through their elected representatives, have had absolutely no input in developing the new global agenda that President Obama has tried to implement without the input or approval of Congress. 
Interestingly, one of those deeply involved in this global agenda, as we noted at the time, was John Podesta, the chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign who previously served as counselor to Obama. Podesta’s emails are at the center of the WikiLeaks disclosures about the operations of the Clinton campaign, the Clinton Foundation and the Democratic Party. 
Podesta, founder of the George Soros-funded Center for American Progress and a member of the elitist Trilateral Commission , went to work for Obama as a senior policy consultant on climate change. A liberal Catholic, he has been a professor at Georgetown Law School. One of the leaked emails shows Podesta saying that he applauds the work of Pope Francis on climate change and that “all my Jesuit friends say the Pope is the real deal.” 
Podesta was picked by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to be a member of the “high-level panel” of “eminent persons” planning the future of the globe. This so-called “High Level Panel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda” released an 81-page report titled, “A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through Sustainable Development.” 
“In simplest terms,” explains Patrick Wood, author of Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation , “Sustainable Development is a replacement economic system for capitalism and free enterprise. It is a system based on resource allocation and usage rather than on supply and demand and free economic market forces.” 
In this context, Wood argues that the major significance of the transfer of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is not the immediate need by the U.N. or some countries to censor websites, but to generate revenue for global purposes. ICANN will do this, he argues, through management of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), the links between the Internet and networks, electronic devices and embedded technology with IP addresses. “IoT are the connections between inanimate objects and the humans that depend upon them,” he notes. To accomplish this, ICANN has devised a new IP numbering system called IPV6, described as the “ vital expansion ” of the Internet. 
“In terms of ‘follow the money,’ IoT is expected to generate upwards of $3 trillion by 2025 and is growing at a rate of at least 30 percent per year,” Wood argues . “In other words, it is a huge market and money is flying everywhere. If the UN can figure out a way to tax this market, and they will, it will provide a windfall of income and perhaps enough to make it self-perpetuating.” 
He adds, “Congress never understood this when they passively let Obama fail to renew our contract with ICANN. However, Obama and his globalist handlers understood it perfectly well, which makes the deception and treachery of it even worse.” 
Under the cover of “sustainable development,” Wood predicts the Internet will be used to construct a massive database on human activities, in order to monitor and control nations’ and peoples’ access to resources. It will constitute ultimate socialist control and a form of “digital slavery,” from which he warns there may be no return. Cliff Kincaid

20646,20646,Angela Merkel to Seek 4th Term as Germany’s Leader - The New York Times,Alison Smale,"BERLIN  —   Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, under siege domestically but widely seen as a pillar of Western liberalism, announced on Sunday that she will seek a fourth term next year. Slightly hoarse but clearly determined after consulting leaders of her conservative Christian Democratic party, Ms. Merkel said the decision to seek a fourth term was “anything but trivial,” for her country, for her party and for herself. A scientist with a   manner, Ms. Merkel rejected the idea that, after the election of Donald J. Trump as president in the United States, she had a lone role in keeping Western liberalism alive. “That is grotesque, even almost absurd,” she told reporters. But she also said that the campaign ahead of the German elections in fall 2017 would be unlike any other she has fought in an increasingly polarized country. She faces stronger challenges on the right and left, while the war in Syria, the arrival of large numbers of migrants and the continuing euro crisis tear at Germany and place new demands on its people. Since the election in the United States, speculation had mounted that Ms. Merkel would bow to pressure to run again and uphold liberal values in a world transformed by Mr. Trump’s victory and Britain’s vote last summer to leave the European Union. Ms. Merkel, 62, has served 11 years as chancellor. She is the first woman and the first person raised in Communist East Germany to hold the post. Since coming to power in 2005, Ms. Merkel has gradually acquired a political stature commensurate with the power of her country, Western Europe’s largest economy and its most populous nation, with about 81 million inhabitants. But her image as the cautious caretaker of her country’s interests has suffered over the past year, after she opened Germany to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers, many of them Muslim refugees fleeing wars in the Middle East and Africa. The prospect of integrating almost 1 million newcomers into Germany has weakened Ms. Merkel’s standing at home, despite garnering some praise, particularly from President Obama. Visiting Berlin last week, Mr. Obama lavished compliments on his   ally in his eight years in office, saying that if he were German, he would vote for her. Ms. Merkel responded to the election of Mr. Trump with a robust appeal for him to follow Western values and respect human dignity. This, she said, was the basis of any close cooperation. Even as commentators and leaders outside Germany invoked her stature, Ms. Merkel has been eager not to hog the limelight. “One person alone can never solve everything,” she said on Friday at a news conference with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain. “We are strong only together. In that, I want to do what my duty is as chancellor. ” In the days before her party leadership met on Sunday, several Christian Democrats said that the next parliamentary elections would be difficult to win with Ms. Merkel, but impossible to win without her. As she entered the atrium of her party headquarters on Sunday, she was applauded by about two dozen people on a   balcony. While Ms. Merkel mentioned several times that her ability to continue would be contingent on good health, she showed little weariness and gradually became almost feisty as she outlined the challenges to German industry and citizens in the 21st century. Germans should stick to their tried and tested concept of “social market economy,” a blend of welfare state and capitalism, as they navigate this new world, Ms. Merkel said. But she acknowledged that even in this conservative and comparatively wealthy country, politics has been thrown into turmoil by the rise of the populist,   Alternative for Germany party. It is now in 10 of the country’s 16 state Parliaments and seems certain to win seats in the federal Parliament next year. That would scramble conventional coalition building, since no mainstream party has been willing to govern with the populists. Frauke Petry, one of the leaders of Alternative for Germany, criticized the idea of Ms. Merkel’s gaining another four years in office. “Germany cannot afford another term for Angela Merkel,” Ms. Petry wrote on Twitter. Ms. Merkel’s role as a beacon of liberal values may also be dented by the power of populism elsewhere in Europe, whose union has been thrown into ever greater doubt since Britain, the Continent’s leading military power, voted in June to leave the European Union. Next month, Italy votes on constitutional reforms that Prime Minister Matteo Renzi considers crucial to his country’s modernity. Austria will choose a president in an election plagued by delays, and may see the first   politician elected as head of state in modern Europe. The Netherlands, France and Germany all hold pivotal elections next year, with the ballot in France being closely watched as a bellwether for the strength of populism as embodied by the National Front of Marine Le Pen. Speaking in Berlin last week, Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France predicted that “Europe can die” as a result of the populist wave and the economic and political dissonance in the   European Union. Ms. Merkel has guided Germany and, increasingly, Europe though myriad crises. She was chancellor during the 2008 financial crisis, and was much criticized for German insistence on austerity during the Greek debt crisis and the subsequent pressure on the euro. Since Russia flexed its military muscle by seizing Crimea and meddling in Ukraine in 2014, Ms. Merkel has been the main Western interlocutor to President Vladimir V. Putin. Ms. Merkel has also led her country in abandoning nuclear power, and has moved her conservative party firmly to the center on social policy. Her personal ratings peaked in 2014 at over 80 percent, when she was handling the Ukraine crisis, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung’s compilation of readings on the Politbarometer poll since she took office. On that scale, her lowest score was 50 percent in late 2010, when Germany joined European efforts to avert a bankruptcy by Greece.",0
20647,20647,Checkmating Obama,Caroline Glick,"Originally published by the Jerusalem Post . 
In one of the immortal lines of Godfather 2 , mafia boss Michael Corleone discusses the fate of his brother, who betrayed him, with his enforcer. “I don’t want anything to happen to him while my mother is alive,” Corleone said. 
Message received. The brother was murdered after their mother’s funeral. Last week it was reported that the Obama administration has delivered a message to the Palestinian Authority. The administration has warned the PA that the US will veto any anti-Israel resolution brought before the UN Security Council before the US presidential elections on November 8. Message received. Open season on Israel at the Security Council will commence November 9. The Palestinians are planning appropriately. Israel needs to plan, too. Israel’s most urgent diplomatic mission today is to develop and implement a strategy that will outflank President Barack Obama in his final eight weeks in power. Lobbying the administration is pointless. Obama has waited eight years to exact his revenge on Israel for not supporting his hostile, strategically irrational policies. And he has no interest in letting bygones be bygones. Before turning to what Israel must do, first we need to understand what Israel can do. A good place to begin is by considering what just transpired at UNESCO, where twice in a week, UNESCO bodies resolved to erase 3,000 years of Jewish history in Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. The fight that Israel waged at UNESCO is not the fight it needs to wage at the Security Council. The stakes at the Security Council are far higher. Like the UN General Assembly, UNESCO’s decisions are non-binding declarations that have no legal or operational significance. As such, there is no reason to expend great resources to fight them. For Israel, the goal of the fight at UNESCO is not to defeat anti-Israel initiatives. That is impossible given the Palestinians’ automatic majority. The purpose of the fight at UNESCO is to humiliate European governments that side with antisemitic initiatives, and to weaken the congenitally anti-Israel body itself. The government achieved both of these objectives. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s disavowal of his own government’s abstention from the vote on the first resolution – like the similar position taken after the fact by the Mexican government – was a diplomatic victory for Israel. So too, the fact that UNESCO’s own Secretary-General Irina Bukova felt compelled to disavow her own agency’s actions by rejecting the resolution’s denial of the Jewish people’s ties to Jerusalem was a significant victory for Israel. Her statement was deeply damaging for UNESCO and its reputation. Finally, the fact that Tanzania and the Philippines voted against the resolution was a testament to Israel’s capacity to convince other governments to abandon their traditional pro-Palestinian voting pattern. The Palestinians won the vote at UNESCO because they are more powerful diplomatically than Israel. They have an automatic anti-Israel majority. But they weren’t empowered by their victory. To the contrary. They were bloodied by it. In a sign of their weakening hold on member nations, the Palestinians and Jordanians felt compelled to send a threatening letter to the members of UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee lest they dare to vote against the resolution. Powerful players don’t make threats. They don’t need to. Israel’s experience at UNESCO teaches us that there are governments that are open to counteroffers. Israel doesn’t need to hide in America’s shadow. It is capable of working on its own to blunt the impact of the Palestinians’ automatic majority. And it will need to use all of its resources to fend off a US-backed assault at the Security Council. Unlike UNESCO, the Security Council can pass legally binding resolutions. Israel needs to be prepared to bring all of its resources to bear to prevent such a resolution from being adopted against it. Obama’s intention to abandon Israel at the Security Council means that Israel comes to this battle severely hobbled. But there is one advantage to the US’s betrayal. Over the years, Israel’s ability to trust the US to veto anti-Israel resolutions at the Security Council was been a mixed blessing. On the one hand, the US has secured Israel from diplomatic assaults. But on the other hand, our ability to trust Washington has made us diplomatically lazy and ineffective. Safe in Washington’s shadow, we have behaved as through all diplomacy is public diplomacy. That is, we have pretended that statecraft begins and ends with making the moral or strategic case for our side against the other guys. But public diplomacy is just one diplomatic tool. The Syrian regime, for instance, has no moral case for securing international support. Bashar Assad didn’t convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to support him by arguing that he is better than alternative regimes. He bought Putin’s support by offering him permanent air and naval bases in Syria. Then there is Morocco, another weak state with no public diplomacy case to make. Last March, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon outraged Rabat when he acknowledged the plain fact that Western Sahara, which Morocco occupies, is “occupied territory.” Morocco quickly secured the support of Spain and France and launched an all-out onslaught against Ban. How did Morocco manage? Morocco’s most powerful diplomatic resource is its control over migration flows from North Africa to Europe. Anytime it wishes, Rabat can open the migratory floodgates just as easily as it can keep them shut. And the French and Spanish know it. In less than a month, Ban issued repeated abject apologies. Game. Set. Match. Morocco. From reports to date, it appears that shortly after the US elections on November 8, the Malaysians or Egyptians will submit a Palestinian-backed resolution that defines Israeli communities in united Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria as illegal. If the resolution is brought to a vote, the US will fail to veto it. Such a resolution, or a resolution obligating Israel to withdraw to the 1949 armistice lines, would cause Israel grave harm. So what resources does Israel have to prevent this from happening? Of course, we have public diplomacy. And that might work with some friendly nations. But it won’t get us over the top. We need to learn from the Syrian and Moroccan examples and consider what we have to offer Security Council members in exchange for their support in scuttling the approaching onslaught against us. One such resource is the US Congress. Israel’s allies in Congress are sickened by the Obama administration’s devastating Middle East policies. A solid majority of lawmakers can be trusted to support actions that will reinforce Israel’s position. Israel has other resources as well that we can trade on. We have natural gas. And we have technologies that the governments of the world require to surmount the challenges of the 21 century. There is no reason to give these resources away when we can trade them for diplomatic support. As for the Palestinians, as the UNESCO vote showed, they are less popular now than at any time in the past 40 years. All they have to offer is threats and antisemitism. Both are powerful weapons. But they are no longer invincible. Israel’s goal must be to use our resources at the Security Council in a manner that will make it impossible for Obama to enable an anti-Israel resolution to pass. A method for achieving this goal has two components. The first component is to convince a friendly country on the Security Council to propose a balanced resolution that would counter the Palestinian-backed Israel-bashing one. Such a resolution could include four points. First, it could deplore efforts to deny Jewish history in Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. Second, it can condemn the PA/PLO for their continued unlawful funding of terrorists. Third, it can urge Israel to restrain settlement construction in areas that in previous negotiations have been identified as likely territory for a future Palestinian state. Fourth, it can call on Israel and the PA to reinstate negotiations immediately without preconditions. Israel has friendly ties with a few Security Council members, among them Uruguay and New Zealand. In the final weeks of the Obama era, it is possible that Israel will be able to convince one of them to submit a balanced resolution along these lines. Obama would be hard-pressed to oppose such a resolution in favor of one that singles Israel out for rebuke. But that still is insufficient. Obama can make Uruguay and New Zealand a better offer if he wishes. And so we move to the second aspect of the plan. If we learn nothing else from the Obama era, we must recognize that the time has come for Israel to stop sufficing with just one Security Council veto. Most states have several. And we need a few more. Russia today is the best place to start our search for a second veto. Putin is a dealmaker. As his agreement with Assad showed, he is willing to consider attractive offers. Obviously, Israel won’t offer Russia bases. But we do have other things to offer Putin in exchange for a veto. For instance, in exchange for a Russian veto at the Security Council, Israel can offer Putin to lobby the US Congress to cancel US sanctions against Russia over Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Israel has no dog in that fight. And the sanctions are not getting the US anywhere. Putin might go for the deal for two reasons. First, by stepping into the breach and defending Israel against Obama, he will humiliate Obama. Second, if Israel succeeds with the Congress, he will reap economic rewards. For his part, Putin wouldn’t even have to openly side with Israel. All he would have to do is announce that in the interests of regional stability, Russia will not support an unbalanced resolution on Israel and the Palestinians. If Putin supports a balanced resolution, Obama will be checkmated. His plan to take revenge on Israel for not following him off the strategic cliff will be foiled. Israel will have survived his presidency. None of this will be easy. And success is far from assured. There are many more ways for Israel to fail than succeed. Our diplomatic weakness remains a millstone around our neck. But as the UNESCO resolutions showed, attacking Israel is no longer cost free. We are not powerless in the grip of circumstances. We have cards to play. And now is the time to play them for all they are worth.",1

Are You On Pace To Reach Your Goals? February 2, 2013 20 Comments Lifestyle 
Today is February 2, 2013 and you’re one month closer to death. What have you done this year to improve yourself? Some may say New Years resolutions are cop-outs for actually setting reasonable goals, instead of starting today we say “In a week I’ll hit the gym and finally get ripped!” I like the idea of coming up with goals and plans to achieve them for January 1st of the next year. The start of each year is a mental rebirth, January 1 is a new snow begging for you to make fresh tracks in it, a blank canvas yearning to be painted on. 
However, many do use New Years resolutions to feel better about themselves. They gorge themselves on baked goods, drink heartily and fail to exercise throughout the month of December telling themselves that “next year will be different” and “just one last time before I change.” This is not the case for us here at Return of Kings. We are different — writers, readers, and commenters all strive to build themselves into the man they want to be. 
Personally, I had some slip-ups through the month of January, but what sets the determined apart from the shambling masses is that we pick ourselves up and keep pushing forward one step at a time . I started the year off strong my days and nights booked full with dates, time with girlfriends, reconnecting with old friends. I eschewed online dating and become more social during the day time. I broke PRs on all of my lifts, dropped a few pounds, and sought coaching for the Olympic lifts. 
Most importantly I held myself accountable for all of my actions. If I ate too much, drank too much or didn’t take opportunities I should have, I picked myself up and adapted. Push forward and give everything you have. How bad do you want it? What happens when you reach your goal? Do you aim higher, or do you stop there and remain content with being slightly above average ? If you choose the latter and have finite, concrete goals you are already anticipating the day you can quit building yourself. You’re doomed for failure.Don’t ever miss an opportunity to get better , take risks , analyze your successes/failures, and don’t stop until you’ve surpassed your goals. Then strive to be better, faster and stronger. 
What are your goals for 2013? Are they SMART ? Do you have a purpose ? Do you want to have sex with more beautiful women, learn a language , lift more weight and make more money? Do you have an accountability buddy or do you journal and meticulously track your progress?

Con la intención de vencer el aburrimiento, Dios Nuestro Señor, ha decidido enviar un huracán de categoría 5 a la Tierra sólo para comprobar qué nombre se inventan los meteorólogos para referirse a él. Según han informado fuentes cercanas al Altísimo, Dios confía en que si genera suficientes huracanes en el planeta, los meteorólogos se verán obligados a recurrir a nombre rebuscados y divertidos como “Huracán Turbo” o “Huracán Papufro”. 
“Estaba sentado sin nada que hacer y he pensado en enviar un huracán a ver si le llaman Carlos o Katrina o Niño”, ha declarado el creador de todas las cosas. “Los hombres se inventan unas cosas que te partes de risa. Si el nombre me gusta, lo subo de categoría 5 a categoría 6, para que sea más famoso”, ha admitido el Santo Padre. 
“Ojalá le pongan ‘Huracán Mistetas'”, ha declarado Dios entre risas. Imagina que con dos millones de huracanes más los hombres acabarían bautizando con ese nombre a algún huracán especialmente mortífero. 
Por ahora, los meteorólogos han bautizado este tifón como “Sin título número 1” hasta que les llegue la inspiración, aunque no descartan llamarlo “Huracán Nancy”, como han llamado a los quince anteriores. El protocolo marca que hasta que no disponen de un nombre atractivo no pueden alertar a la población de la llegada del huracán.

20650,20650,"After Bombings, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Clash Over Terrorism - The New York Times",Alexander Burns and Nicholas Confessore,"A suspect in a bombing was still at large Monday morning, his motives and intentions unknown  —   but Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump were already racing to seize the political upper hand. With a manhunt still in progress before an arrest later in the day, Mrs. Clinton sought to shift the terms of the presidential contest back in her direction. She called Mr. Trump a “recruiting sergeant for the terrorists” and, from a rainy airport in White Plains, offered herself as a seasoned warrior against terrorism. Mr. Trump returned fire hours later, blaming Mrs. Clinton and President Obama’s handling of immigration and the Iraq war for bringing terrorism to American shores. He called for vigorous police profiling of people from the Muslim world and drew a direct equation between immigration controls and national defense. The attacks could reframe the presidential race around stark questions of national security after weeks of   sniping between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton over more personal matters of character, transparency and medical records. The violence of the weekend is all but certain to ripple in the first presidential debate, set for next Monday at Hofstra University on Long Island. For both the candidates and their parties, the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend are a critical inflection point. Not since the Iraq war has the mantle of national security and protection been more vigorously contested than it has been in this campaign, or its textures more difficult to define. With seven weeks left in the campaign, the candidates’ responses to an apparent terrorist plot on American soil could sharply alter voters’ views not only of them but of the parties they lead. And both candidates set up extraordinary stakes, each asserting that the other was not only wrong on national security, but actively abetting terrorists in word or deed. It was Mrs. Clinton who appeared most determined to bend the moment to her advantage. Unlike most Democratic nominees, she has enjoyed an edge over her Republican opponent on issues of national security and foreign policy. Having faced a rocky stretch in the presidential race, punctuated by a bout of pneumonia, she appeared to welcome a renewed debate over terrorism. Before flying to Philadelphia to court younger voters, Mrs. Clinton held a news conference to call for “courage and vigilance” in the face of terrorism, and warned that Mr. Trump was unprepared to keep the country safe. Citing former intelligence and counterterrorism officials who have criticized Mr. Trump’s caustic remarks about Islam, Mrs. Clinton leveled an attack that might have shocked the political world in any other campaign: In addition to calling him a “recruiting sergeant” for terrorists, she accused him of giving “aid and comfort” to the Islamic State with his campaign oratory. “We’re going after the bad guys, and we’re going to get them, but we’re not going after an entire religion,” Mrs. Clinton said, adding, “We know that Donald Trump’s comments have been used online for the recruitment of terrorists. ” It was the most drastic version yet of an attack Mrs. Clinton has tried out recently with increasing boldness: In an interview on Israeli television this month, she said the Islamic State was praying for Mr. Trump’s victory, and she has warned that foreign adversaries could seek to sway the election in her opponent’s favor. Mr. Trump, she said on Monday, has helped the Islamic State and other terrorist groups cast their attacks as part of a religious war between Islam and the West. “They are looking to make this into a war against Islam, rather than a war against jihadists, violent terrorists,” Mrs. Clinton said. “The kinds of rhetoric and language Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries. ” Mr. Trump responded with indignation. His campaign released a string of statements expressing outrage, criticizing Mrs. Clinton for favoring more lenient immigration policies and calling her attack on Mr. Trump tantamount to an accusation of treason. At a rally in Florida on Monday afternoon, Mr. Trump blasted Mrs. Clinton for failing, as a member of the Obama administration, to stop the rise of the Islamic State, employing much the same     argument he has used to demand an overhaul of government on domestic matters. “Her weakness, her ineffectiveness, caused the problem, and now she wants to be president,” he said. “I don’t think so. ” Mr. Trump directly equated American vulnerability to terrorism with what he called laxness in the immigration system. He has mainly warned about the risk of admitting refugees from Syria and other   countries, though the suspect arrested in the weekend attacks, Ahmad Khan Rahami, is a naturalized citizen born in Afghanistan and has lived in the United States for years. “These attacks, and many others, were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system,” Mr. Trump said, trying to return the political debate to the issue he is most comfortable discussing. “Immigration security,” he added, “is national security. ” But Mr. Trump may have to clear a higher standard than merely keeping up, punch for punch, with Mrs. Clinton. While he has drawn close to her in the polls, he still faces broad reservations among voters about his readiness to serve as commander in chief. In the past, he has provoked a backlash after terror attacks by fulminating against Muslims and shifting too quickly onto the offensive. If Mr. Trump finished the day with a forceful speech denouncing Mrs. Clinton, he began with a meandering telephone interview with Fox News, during which he asserted that there were “many foreign connections” to the weekend attacks, though none had been established. And he suggested, again without supplying evidence, that American police officers fail to act against terrorism suspects because of political correctness. Mr. Trump also applauded himself for having described the Saturday night explosion in New York City as a bombing even before the police did. “I should be a newscaster,” he said. “I called it before the news. ” The hostilities between the candidates erupted at the start of a week when both were aiming to cut a presidential profile and to strengthen their credentials on the international stage by meeting with foreign leaders in New York at the annual session of the United Nations General Assembly. In many respects, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign against Mr. Trump has flipped the traditional contours of defense politics, offering voters a Democrat with more hawkish instincts and deeper ties to the national security establishment, and a Republican who has broadly rejected military intervention and has been spurned by many defense leaders in his own party. Mrs. Clinton is by far the more conventionally experienced and credentialed candidate, and in some respects is more hawkish: She has called for the creation of a   zone in Syria, as well as more airstrikes there, and has urged closer collaboration with Silicon Valley to expand the United States’ surveillance capabilities, alarming some civil liberties advocates. In Mr. Trump, she confronts a candidate who has been abandoned by most of his party’s national security elite, who is still unable to produce a detailed set of proposals for stopping terrorism, and whose essential political brand  —   disruption  —   does not always comfort voters seeking strength in moments of crisis and terror. Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman for Mr. Obama, said that if Democrats were conventionally cast as the “mommy party” and Republicans as the “daddy party” in American politics, then “Trump is the crazy uncle and Hillary Clinton is the only person you trust to watch your family for a week. ” Mr. Trump has also cast doubt on American participation in NATO and spoken warmly of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president and strongman. And in recent days, he has feuded with Robert M. Gates, a highly regarded former defense secretary, and found himself mocked by another respected national security figure, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who called Mr. Trump “a national disgrace and an international pariah” in private emails released by hackers last week. Whatever doubts many voters still have about Mrs. Clinton’s trustworthiness, most appear to consider her better suited to manage foreign policy and threats to the American people. Before the Chelsea bombing, according to a New York   News poll, voters gave her a slight edge on the question of who would better handle terrorism and national security, and a large one on foreign policy. Some polling suggests that she has a bigger lead over Mr. Trump on related questions  —   who would be a better commander in chief, for example  —   than past Democratic nominees have had over Republicans. “Voters look for the qualities of experience, temperament and judgment,” said Evan McMullin, a former intelligence officer who is running for president as a conservative independent candidate. “Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump lack some or all of them. But Trump lacks all of them. ”",0

Sin embargo sus funciones fueron meramente representativas. En 2009 se hizo un intento por sustituirla por la Unión Aduanera, y en 2010 esta empezó comenzó con Rusia y Kazajistán. Al año siguiente se unió también Bielorrusia y los controles aduaneros entre los tres se eliminaron. Posteriormente, en 2015, Armenia y Kirguistán se sumaron a este grupo. La CEI, ¿qué es y para qué se creó esta organización tras el colapso de la URSS? 
“La UEE es necesaria para conservar y fortalecer los lazos económicos entre unos países que una vez formaron parte de la misma nación: la URSS, y que después de cuya caída se alejaron considerablemente unos de otros en el plano económico”, afirma Evgueni Guschin, investigador del Laboratorio Internacional de Investigaciones Económicas Internacionales de la Academia Presidencial Rusa de Economía Nacional y Administración Pública. 
El experto afirma que la UEE debe convertirse en un escenario para la integración de la economía de sus miembros en el sistema mundial. “Actualmente la tendencia es que en el mundo se forman varios grandes bloques comerciales de integración”, añade Guschin. Se podría afirmar que la UEE es más efectiva que la CEI, especialmente en lo que se refiere a la implementación de sus decisiones. 
Evgueni Guschin cree que son tres los motivos principales para el éxito de la UEE. Primero, los lazos históricos y culturales de los países de la URSS; al fin y al cabo, países que un día formaron parte de una misma nación lo tienen más fácil para integrarse. Segundo, la voluntad política de los miembros, que determina la dirección estratégica de la integración económica de Eurasia. Tercero, el órgano de administración: la Comisión Económica Euroasiática, cuyo funcionamiento altamente profesional facilita el diálogo y la resolución de conflictos entre los países de la Unión. Fundamentos del funcionamiento 
“Como asociación supranacional, la UEE supone una integración bastante más exhaustiva de los países miembro que la CEI, comparable en grado con la de la UE”, afirma el analista financiero de Finan, Timur Nigmatullin. La UEE permite que se reduzcan drásticamente los límites comerciales de diverso tipo entre los países y facilita el movimiento de capital y de mano de obra. 
De continuar como hasta ahora, el efecto multiplicador de la asociación a largo plazo aportará a Rusia hasta un 0,5% en PIB al año, y para los participantes de menor tamaño, hasta un 1%, según cálculos de Nigmatullin. 
“La UEE ha formado en gran medida un mercado común para los países que la conformaron”, explica Serguéi Jestanov, consejero de macroeconomía del director general de Otkrytie Bróker. Según el experto, el papel principal de esta organización es la eliminación de las barreras comerciales para la mayoría de los productos. 
Durante la primera etapa se realizó un trabajo de integración aduanera, comercial y de regulación. 
Los miembros de la asociación tenían una misión importante: elaborar de un marco jurídico único de las esferas principales de trabajo y crear las condiciones necesarias para la armonización de las legislaciones nacionales. 
En 2010 entró en vigor el Código de Aduanas y en Rusia, Bielorrusia y Kazajistán se puso en funcionamiento un sistema único de regulación. Se aprobaron documentos normativos de administración de aduanas, incluidas las normas generales de declaración de mercaderías. Gracias a ello, se redujo considerablemente la cantidad de documentos necesarios para el registro de declaraciones de mercancías y desapareció el control aduanero de las fronteras de los países participantes del acuerdo. 
Posteriormente, en 2012, surgió un órgano reglamentario único para la unión: la Comisión Euroasiática. En enero de ese año se adoptaron 17 acuerdos base internacionales que conformaban el Espacio Económico Euroasiático. Su formación supuso la garantía de las llamadas cuatro libertades: circulación de bienes, servicios, capital y fuerza de trabajo. 
La labor para fortalecer la integración entre los participantes del proyecto euroasiático económico, realizada durante la etapa de formación del Espacio Económico Euroasiático, permitió que las naciones prepararan las condiciones para la creación de la Unión Económica Euroasiática , la cual entró en funcionamiento a partir del 1 de enero de 2015. 
El nuevo contrato definía el marco jurídico de los servicios del mercado único. Se establecieron los principios generales de regulación técnica. Para octubre de 2016 la lista de reglamentos técnicos adoptados por la Unión Económica Euroasiática contaba ya con 36 documentos, 34 de los cuales ya han entrado en vigor. 
“La UEE ha conseguido crear la condiciones para fortalecer y desarrollar la cooperación comercial y económica entre los estados miembro”, señala Evgueni Guschin. Según el experto, prueba de ello es la estadística del volumen de comercio exterior de Rusia en 2015, que en condiciones de regresión general del volumen de exportación e importación, no se vio tan reducido dentro de la UEE como con respecto a otros países del mundo. 
En 2015 se unieron las repúblicas de Armenia y Kirguistán y Unión Económica Euroasiática ostenta el segundo puesto en lo que se refiere al nivel de integración de las asociaciones económicas, detrás de de la Unión Europea. ¿Una segunda Unión Europea? 
Según Evgueni Guschin, al comparar la UEE con la Unión Europea, es necesario tener en cuenta primeramente lo joven que es la primera. 
“La UE tiene a sus espaldas un largo recorrido sobre desarrollo de integración,que va desde la Comunidad Europea del Carbón y del Acero surgida tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial. De momento la UEE no puede presumir del nivel de integración alcanzado en esta Europa cohesionada”, comenta Guschin. Sin embargo, según afirma, la experiencia de la UE, tanto positiva como negativa, se ha tenido en cuenta al crear la UEE. 
“En general no se puede hablar de un proceso exitoso o fallido al hablar de un proyecto de tal envergadura internacional como es la UEE. En una primera unión se trazaron los intereses económicos y políticos concernientes a las esferas de influencia”, explica Alexander Yegórov, principal analista de TeleTrade. 
Según el experto, en comparación con la CEI, la Unión Económica Euroasiática es una organización más viable, pues en la base de la alianza yacen los intereses económicos de los participantes. 
“A diferencia de la CEI, la UEE no es, primeramente, una unión política sino económica. Sin una integración sólida con otros bloques económicos se desarrollará bastante despacio pues ya que, a excepción de Rusia, la economía de las demás naciones es excesivamente pequeña”, afirma Gueorgui Vaschenko, de la compañía inversora Freedom Finance. 
Este mismo mes comienzan las negociaciones sobre la creación de zonas de libre comercio entre la Unión Económica Euroasiática y China en un formato de “cinco más uno”. Sobre esa base se puede hablar de la formación de una colaboración euroasiática especial en el amplio sentido de la palabra.",1

An informed source in Yemen's AnsarAllah stated, last night, missile strikes by Yemen Houthis aimed to annihilate the Saudi's invading air force base in Jeddah. 
Saudis have repeatedly targeted the cities and Yemeni defenseless people by their air strikes through this airport. 
He said: we have admonished Saudis several times so far and urged them to put an end to their attacks, otherwise we would prevent them from committing tortures and crimes through our attacks. A ballistic missile Berkane was fired at King Abdulaziz airport, which is the Saudi's Royal air force position. This attack caused wide damages to the airport, leading to its closure.

Le groupe va faire restaurer le monument en ruines et permettre aux touristes de visiter la résidence. Alors, que sait-on sur le palais et combien d'argent faudra-t-il pour le restaurer ? Facebook 
Ropcha. Crédit : Lori/Legion-Media Pourquoi le palais est-il célèbre ? 
Le palais de Ropcha est une ancienne résidence des Romanov datant du XVIIIe siècle. Il fut construit sur ordre de Pierre le Grand et devait évoquer la station thermale de Karslbad (République Tchèque). Ensuite, durant le règne de l’impératrice Elisabeth, un nouveau palais de deux étages fut construit par l’architecte italien Bartolomeo Rastrelli, et un grand parc fut installé. 
Après la révolution de palais qui vit la destitution de Pierre III, celui-ci y fut exilé et y mourut dans des circonstances douteuses. Après la Révolution d’Octobre, le palais fut nationalisé et abrita une pisciculture, un sovkhoze et d’autres installations agricoles. 
Le palais avant 1917. Crédit : domaine public 
En 1944, le palais fut brûlé par les troupes allemandes en retraite. Après la guerre, la propriété fut restaurée, il y fut d’abord stationné une unité aérienne, puis le bataillon de défense chimique du district militaire de Leningrad. 
Dans les années 1960, le palais fut placé sur protection de l’État, et il fut classifiéà la fin des années 1970. Lire aussi : Gatchina, ce pavillon de chasse qui est devenu un palais Combien d’argent faudra-t-il pour restaurer les ruines ? 
Bien que le palais soit inscrit au patrimoine mondial de l’ Unesco depuis 1990 et soit protégé par l’État, la plupart de ses bâtiments sont en ruines. Le palais fut sérieusement endommagé par une série d’incendies à la fin des années 1980 et au début des années 1990. En 2016, cinq colonnes du portique de la façade se sont effondrées. Après cette dernière catastrophe, le ministère russe de la Culture eut alloué 15 millions de roubles (220 000 euros) à des travaux urgents pour sauver le monument. 
Le palais est en ruines aujourd'hui. Crédit : Kommersant. 
Au palais de Peterhof, on fait la constatation que de nombreux bâtiments de Ropcha sont fortement endommagés, et certains, comme les ponts et les équipements hydrauliques, sont totalement détruits. Le coût total de la restauration pourrait dépasser les 5 milliards de roubles (72 millions d’euros). Lire aussi : La Nouvelle-Hollande, un îlot de détente en plein cœur de Saint-Pétersbourg Pourquoi l’État cherche-t-il des investisseurs pour restaurer ces monuments ? 
La grande difficulté et le coût de la restauration du patrimoine ne permettent pas toujours de mener ces travaux grâce à l’argent public. Il est donc souvent fait appel à l’argent de compagnies privées et de mécènes. Par exemple, la restauration du palais de Gatchina près de Saint-Pétersbourg fut largement financée par la banque VTB et l’usine de spiritueux de Gatchina, mais le monument resta propriété de l'État.

L’État peut décider de vendre aux enchères ou de louer des éléments du patrimoine culturel avec obligation de les restaurer. Depuis le 1er janvier 2008, il est possible de privatiser des monuments d’importance non seulement locale et régionale, mais aussi fédérale. 
Il existe plus de cent exemples de telles privatisations assorties d’obligation de restauration. C’est ainsi qu’a récemment été ouvert à Saint-Pétersbourg le complexe Nouvelle Hollande, reconstruit grâce aux investissements de la société Novaya Gollandia development de Roman Abramovitch.

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Hillary Clinton bagman Terry McAuliffe contributed in excess of $675,500 to the Senate candidacy of the wife of FBI agent Deputy Director Andrew McCabe who oversaw the investigation into her use of an illegal homebrew server that exposed our national secrets to Russian hackers. McAuliffe has been a Democrat operative whose willingness to do the Clinton’s dirty work over a long number of years saw him rewarded with the governorship of Virginia. As governor, McAuliffe recruited the wife of the FBI’s lead investigator to be his party’s senate nominee at the behest of Hillary Clinton who was already being investigated by the FBI. 
Acting on the direction of Hillary Clinton, McAuliffe’s PAC contributed $467,500 directly to the Senate Campaign of D. Jill McCabe according to campaign finance records.

20655,20655,Comment on Lena Dunham strips down to a ‘sensual pantsuit’ as she raps to campaign for Hillary Clinton by Maryaha,Maryaha,"  DCG | 4 Comments 
Another Hollyweird Clinton supporter being trashy . Thank goodness this election is over soon. 
From Daily Mail : She is no stranger to baring it all for her series Girls. But now Lena Dunham is stripping down to show support for her presidential hopeful. 
The 30-year-old comedienne released a rap video to help campaign for Hillary Clinton on comedy website Funny Or Die on Thursday. The three-minute clip was titled Sensual Pantsuit Anthem and featured Tony Award winning performer Cynthia Erivo and radio/television personality Charlamagne Tha God. 
Perhaps the most eye-opening scene of the entire gag is when Lena decides to ditch her red pantsuit to reveal a matching two-piece bikini-like number. As she is ripping off her clothing she rhymes: ‘And now I’m going to take off my pantsuit to reveal a more sensual pantsuit cause that’s what you do for the candidate you love.’ 
The 36-year-old of Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club replies: ‘Not sure I really understand the logic here. The rapping is trash and why are you wearing Hillary’s lingerie?’ Charlamagne presses her on the rationale behind the decision to rap and strip down and Lena hopes for some female solidarity as she says: ‘Dance with me Cynthia take your pantsuit off and show us your sensual pantsuit Cynthia.’ The 29-year-old actress and singer is not so keen as she sings: ‘No I’m good!’ 
This leaves Lena to question the entire video as she says: ‘I wonder if I’m actually hurting her chances of winning.’ The video concludes with Charlamagne reminding everyone to vote on Tuesday, November 8. 
Lena has been unafraid to show her allegiance to Hillary leading up to the election as she used her Halloween costume for a bit of political satire just a few days ago. 
On Monday, the Girls creator dressed up as a cat but had hands fastened to her body so that she was a ‘grabbed p***y’.

20657,20657,U.S. and India Mark a New Moment in Relations as Narendra Modi Speaks to Congress - The New York Times,Gardiner Harris and Coral Davenport,"WASHINGTON  —   Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India condemned global terrorism and said during a lengthy address to Congress on Wednesday that growing economic ties benefit both his country and the United States. “The innovation strength of our two countries comes together in California,” said Mr. Modi, who visited California last year. “Here, the innovative genius of America and India’s intellectual creativity are working to shape new industries of the future. ” Mr. Modi made clear that he intended the speech to hail a new moment in relations between the United States and India when he told Congress at the outset that he had started his visit to Washington with a trip to Arlington National Cemetery. He called it “the final resting place of many brave soldiers of this great land. ” “I honored their courage and sacrifice for the ideals of freedom and democracy,” Mr. Modi added. Indian leaders have long been skeptical of American military power and have often been deeply critical of the Vietnam War and other military interventions by the United States. Celebrating American war dead, though, was a telling signal of what both sides say is a very different relationship between the two countries. Mr. Modi has encouraged a continued American military presence in Afghanistan because he is worried that Pakistan will have unchallenged influence there once the Americans leave. “Your contribution in keeping the region safe and secure is deeply appreciated,” Mr. Modi said, adding: “A commitment to rebuild a peaceful and stable and prosperous Afghanistan is our shared objective. ” Almost exactly 31 years ago, Rajiv Gandhi, then India’s prime minister, also spoke of Afghanistan in an address to Congress. But he did it in the context of justifying the Soviet military presence there because, he said, Soviet troops were “invited by the Karmal regime,” a reference to the   government of President Babrak Karmal. The different references to Afghanistan are a measure of just how much relations between the world’s largest democracies have changed in three decades. In another sign of a break with the past, Mr. Modi gave a strong endorsement for global institutions, most of them created with American leadership. “Growing uncertainties and political complexities  —   our engagement can make a difference by promoting cooperation, not dominance,” Mr. Modi said. “Connectivity, not isolation. Inclusive, not exclusive mechanism. Respect for global commons and, above all, for international rules and norms. ” Then Mr. Modi made an explicit reference to China by endorsing the “freedom of navigation on seas,” referring to disputes involving the South China Sea and China’s efforts to carve out part of those waters as its own. Mr. Modi was the fifth Indian prime minister to address Congress, and the appearance represents a turnaround in his acceptance within the United States. For years Mr. Modi was barred from getting a visa to come here because of his role in 2002 riots in the Indian state of Gujarat that cost the lives of more than 1, 000 people, mostly Muslims. But as he rose as a national political figure in India, United States diplomats sought to put that difficult history to rest. Mr. Modi’s decision to accelerate   ties with the United States has been greeted in Washington with excitement and surprise. On Tuesday, he held meetings at the White House with President Obama, where the two leaders formalized a wide range of agreements covering climate change, renewable energy, security and economic issues. Before Congress, Mr. Modi also repeated that India was open for business. Mr. Modi is eager for greater foreign investment, and although he has failed to deliver many fundamental reforms that would make business easier to conduct there, the smaller steps he has taken and his obvious enthusiasm have persuaded some major investors to give India a try. In his speech, Mr. Modi gave a nod to his difficulties in passing much of his economic reform agenda. Although Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party has a majority in the Lok Sabha, India’s lower house of Parliament, it does not have a majority in the upper house, the Rajya Sabha. “Mr. Speaker, I’m informed that the working of the U. S. Congress is harmonious,” Mr. Modi said to laughter. “I’m also told that you’re well known for your bipartisanship. Well, you are not alone. Time and again, I have also witnessed a similar spirit in the Indian Parliament. ” India’s economy is now the   large economy in the world, but jobs are not being created at anywhere close to the pace needed to employ the roughly one million Indians who come of age each month. Mr. Modi also touched on the issue of climate change in his speech, but subtly reinforced the point that the willingness of India  —   the world’s   carbon emitter  —   to cut its own pollution will depend on help from the United States. “The protection of the environment and caring of the planet is central to our vision of a just world,” he said, adding, “for us in India to live in harmony with mother earth is part of our ancient beliefs. ” But, he said, “Our partnership aims to balance responsibility and capacity and focuses on new ways to increase availability of renewable energy. ” Mr. Modi has vowed to sharply increase the growth of solar power in India, but Indian diplomats have also pushed for commitments from the United States to make new solar power technologies available as cheaply as possible, either by waiving intellectual property fees or by providing favorable financing. “This has been the goal of our efforts in G20 and climate change summits,” Mr. Modi said, to a mixed ovation  —   lawmakers on the Democratic side of the aisle stood and clapped, while those on the Republican side mostly stayed seated. Mr. Modi was forceful in his condemnation of global terrorism, a subject he dwelt on at length. “Not just in Afghanistan but elsewhere in South Asia and globally, terrorism remains the biggest threat,” he said, adding in a clear reference to Pakistan: “Although its shadow is spreading across the world, it is incubated in India’s neighborhood. ” India’s long rivalry with Pakistan has meant that India has been a target of terror attacks funded and encouraged by Pakistan, most famously in the Mumbai terror attacks of 2008. Some members of Congress have criticized Mr. Modi’s human rights record, but the politics of a visit by an Indian leader have also changed. Before Mr. Modi spoke, the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced more than a dozen members of Congress who were said to be escorting Mr. Modi into the chamber. There are 3. 5 million   and they are a highly successful immigrant group with both wealth and deep community connections, making them sought after by politicians. In just one example, some 40 percent of hotel rooms in the United States are owned or managed by   according to Arun K. Singh, India’s ambassador to the United States.",0
20658,20658,"Comment on 5 Corporations Own The U.S. Media – We’ve Been Conditioned How To Think, What To Think, And What To Do by You’re Being Fooled: The Problem With ‘Alternative’ News Websites – Collective Evolution",You’re Being Fooled: The Problem With ‘Alternative’ News Websites – Collective Evolution,"  From the day we are born into this world, we are being taught what our parents have been taught, and what their parents have taught them, without asking many questions such as who we are, why we are here, and why things are the way they are. Existential questions are simply perceived as irrelevant in a left-brained society; in which money and career performance seem to be the primary focus. For those who seek a reason, countless financed religious institutions claim to provide the ultimate answers and a securing spiritual identity. From cradle to grave, we are following the guidelines of what authority defines as a state-of-the-art system, in which “success” seems to begin and end within the running wheel of education, career performance, debt management and retirement. A vibrant economy is the ultimate priority of our global hierarchy. However, a vibrant planet, the respect of all life forms, healthy foods, peaceful ways and conscious actions seem to remain a mere subject of conversation, often turned into a few fundraising campaigns with very little or no impact at all. After all, living consciously and in perfect harmony with nature certainly goes against the principles of industrialism. Generations have passed, trends have changed, technologies have emerged and a better communication has opened doors for alternative information and ideas that are pushing the envelope on society’s boundaries. Yet they all seem to remain in the “fantasy” section of our industrialist system, for in the good old ways of a governing establishment we ought to trust. “Authority knows best” is the slogan of our conventional wisdom, and we meanwhile can mind our own business, go on with our lives, get our needs met and attempt to live happily ever after as long as we conform to the expected norms of society. We then pass on this set of unquestioned beliefs and habits to our children, encouraging then to perpetuate the same cycle, because after all, it is all we’ve ever known. Is this all there is to life? Is this way of life forever sustainable?· Do we have to live this way? What is the purpose of our existence? Such questions are well worth asking, because to realize that there is more to us than what we’ve been led to believe is the first step towards uncovering answers. “The search implies that there is something more to life than what is presently the case.” – Jeff Foster Human Nature or Human Conditioning We have been told that the state of our world is purely the result of our inherent human nature. Some even say we are born ill intended, and learn the “good values” through stringent parental, educational or religious discipline. Even though this version of the story has been adopted and repeated by many, we are going to take the road less travelled. Instead of qualifying our true nature as predetermined and unchangeable, could it be that the current state of humanity is the result of a second nature? By definition, a “second nature” is an acquired behaviour that has been so long practiced to the point where it seems innate. It is a conditioning of consciousness, rather than a fundamental characteristic of consciousness. Considering the fact that humanity’s consciousness has been externally influenced for a very long time, shouldn’t this lead us to question how much of our behaviours and aspirations are actually ours? Without a doubt, our society is programmed to sell us on competing belief systems, political views, brands and products, and the list could go on forever. After all, maintaining the trend of such mindsets is what is profitable to the system. Whether it is a cream that promises beauty, a substance that promises relief, a car that promises attention, a career that promises prestige, or a luxurious lifestyle that promises eternal happiness, this system is an expert at creating billions of needs only to sell us on ideas and products that promises to satisfy them. The Mainstream media is the best example of a great influence on the human mind. TV shows, magazines, the news, politics, education, or organised religion all tend to either implement a sense of patriotism, materialism, idolism, conformism, or any compliant mindset that seem to fit the bill of an authority figure. We have been slowly yet surely trained to avoid critical questioning, and to allow what we call our “leaders” to decide of our individual and collective destiny. When it comes to the word “conspiracy” -or the simple thought that the ones in power may not have the benefit of the whole at heart -ridicule is a very popular reaction and is often the treatment that whistleblowers, experts or ex-government officials/employees receive when trying share such simple information. The word has even been paired with “theory”, because people in general have better things to do than to research information that is being labeled as theoretical. Yet the question that we should begin to ask ourselves is: Why would authority would give any credibility to those who challenge and question authority? In this article, we are going to bypass the scrutiny of information and the need to prove opinions or facts, because after all, it is no one else’s job to think for ourselves but ourselves. All information emerging from both sides of the coin in regards to our economic system, our governments or even events such as 9/11 is already out there for us to evaluate. It is therefore up to the individual to switch off the tendency to filter information out of acquired preconceptions, to step aside from “chain reactions” and to research throughly and intuitively. Then again, no matter how much data our brain may take in, it is not necessarily more information that shall make us more “enlightened”. As Einstein once said, “Information is not knowledge.” The point I am making is that constantly thinking in accord to the beliefs we cherish or the information we advocate is certainly not the extent of what knowledge and understanding is. In order to move forward, we have to look beyond competing beliefs and conceptual answers. Whether we are speaking of individuals who proclaim themselves as awake and aware, teachers, religious people or intellectuals; segregation will always cause us to fail to see the bigger picture -as long as we let ourselves be run by our egoic mind *. The Ego vs. The Observer Self The truth is, aside from all of the concepts, belief systems, patterns and behaviours we may have acquired since birth, we all possess a profound awareness that does not relate with our egoic mind. It is a pure awareness that does not filter information with acquired beliefs, and therefore does not have a clouded perception. This consciousness is what some call the intuition, the inner-knowing, the heart, the gut feeling or the soul, yet the word that shall be employed for the moment is the observer self While a teacher teaches what they have been taught, a priest preaches the bible’s teachings, and a politician reiterates the same system, the observer self is the awareness that is not manipulated by anyone or anything, for it does not depend on external factors to build up an identity. It only observes with a clear lens, and therefore see’s things as they truly are. 
“Your original unconditioned consciousness exists only in you, so going elsewhere can never give you access to your essential nature, to who you really are.” – Byron Brown For example, a young child would naturally perceive a hierarchical government creating wars and the destruction of our planet for economical purposes, as utter nonsense. Yet generations who have been conditioned to believe and teach that war ends war, or that pieces of paper and digits on a computer are the only thing that can make the world go round, are more likely to ignore the self-destruction it implies and “run with the money”. “As things are interpreted or labeled by the mind they slowly cease to be what they are and start to become what is thought about them.”– John Greven Let’s bring forth our observer self for a moment an answer these following questions: Would an awake and aware population allow the damaging and destruction of our home -the Earth- for the sake of the economy? Would it perpetuate the use of petrol -despite the alternatives- for the sake of the economy? Would it allow war profiteering for the sake of the economy? Would it in-debt the poor for the sake of the economy? Would its thoughts be consumed by the obsession of material goods and superficial values? And finally, would an awake and aware population believe in waiting for world leaders to make the world a more harmonious place, when the priorities above are specifically what empower them? Simple observations are really all that is required to blatantly see and feel the imbalance of such a disconnected state of consciousness. However, this is exactly what we are collectively enabling while we keep ourselves busy and distracted over competing with each other’s social statuses, beliefs, race, identities, opinions, and so forth. All of which are often stances that we take on from the very system profiting from all of the priorities mentioned above. A sense of separation from each other, the earth and all other life forms is an obvious characteristic of our system, which has consequently reinforced humanity’s own sense of separation from everyone and everything. We willingly go at war and kill each other, passively accept poverty and famine as being normal while others over consume, and continue to obsess over financial profit despite the consequences. This sense of separation has gotten to the point where parts of the western world knowingly dump their toxic waste in developing countries, as if sending pollution farther away will hide the fact that we all live on the same earth. Yet despite our belief in being separated from the environment, from each other, and by imaginary borders, we all possess an inner knowing that remains unhampered by external indoctrination. This knowing -earlier referred to as the observer self -see’s all life as a whole. Instead of thinking in terms of what can serve or harm ME, it naturally thinks in terms of what can serve or harm US.￼ Take for example a child who did not yet take on a patriotic identity that gives importance to illusory borders, who does not yet comprehend the “ownership” and price tagging of nature, and who does not hold any form of cultural belief system or prejudice. Would this child go to war with another earthling, destroy the planet in the name of pieces of paper and digits on a computer, or be too greedy to desire a world in which we all share the planet’s resources equally? Just like this child, the observer self too perceives purely, with no concept that taints its vision. 
Many of our ideas and beliefs about ourselves and the world are so deeply ingrained that we are unaware that they are beliefs, and take them, without question, for the absolute truth. – Rupert Spira When we consciously choose to expand our awareness and to simply observe what our system stands for, we realize it does not have to be this way. It is simply erroneous to presume that it endorses a forever-sustainable way of living. It has no concern for respecting nature, or even human lives. It only profits through the promotion of unconsciousness . The simple act of turning on the TV or observing the magazines they sell us at the cashier’s waiting line should make the preceding statement very clear. We may think that an intellectual society offering a stringent education system -which has brought many individuals to a state of esteemed expertise- would naturally lead us to the peak of our human evolution. Yet when we look at the wars we still engage in, the increasing rate of health deterioration, the repetitive oil leaks in our oceans, and the amount of corrupted government regulations that won’t budge, shouldn’t that lead us to ask ourselves: What exactly are we learning? Will we need to experience the shutting down of the earth’s eco-system before we finally set aside our differences and awaken to our interconnectedness and equality with each other, the earth and all life forms? A Shift In Consciousness: Awakening to Oneness 
“To me, spirituality is about two things: The liberation of consciousness from all illusion, so that the true nature can shine, and an embodiment in life that is an alternative to the patterns of manipulation and greed that dominate our current culture.” –Christian Opitz “ Oneness ” simply means the awareness of our inherent interconnectedness with each other, the earth, the animal kingdom, and essentially the entire universe. It is the profound understanding -beyond opinionated beliefs- that we are all equal facets of the same underlying consciousness in which all life arises. Some physicists call this consciousness “The Unified Field”, some call it a Universal Consciousness, others name it “God”, yet the word that shall be employed in this article is Source. Source is not a separate, superior and judgmental entity as our society’s endorsed religious institutions want us to believe, but is in fact the core essence of who we truly are beyond the experience of separation. Click here to watch the video ‘An Answer To Existential Questions’ For a long period of time, human consciousness has remained caught up within in a very limited archaic programming, which led us to perpetually seeing ourselves as separate from each other, from all lifeforms and from the earth. Hence why we have ended up passively enabling such ill-treatment between each other and the environment. The reality we have created for ourselves is the result of living our lives with our egoic minds in the driver’s seat. We are experiencing the projection of a strictly left-brained consciousness, where we believe there is nothing more to us than the individual physicality, mind, thoughts and emotions. Our society -which is a reflection of this state of consciousness- exclusively honors the ego-driven cleverness of the mind, instead of encouraging the reunification with our heart/soul consciousness. In this state, we have allowed division, fear, and control to keep us from taking responsibility for ourselves and awaken to our true nature, all while waiting for “saviors” or political dictators to outline our individual and collective destiny. Such a disconnected state of consciousness is unsustainable and if not shifted, would lead humanity to its own demise. 
“Our species is far too clever to survive without wisdom.”– E.F.Schumacker Planet earth is currently undergoing a shift in consciousness. This awakening is leading an increasing amount of individuals to reconnect with their observer self, which is enabling them to perceive the world from a wider, more unified perspective. More are beginning to not only question the ego-driven structures controlling humanity, but to question the very purpose of their existence and of life itself. Such an existential crisis has purposefully guided many towards remembering to who they truly are beyond the mind and the physicality: Souls (the observer self) having a human experience . Because of a past collective soul agreement, we initially incarnated on earth into what is called the “experiential realm”. The purpose was of experiencing and evolving as souls, lifetime after lifetime, while being overruled by a thicker sense of individual identity, mind and ego, and having no direct remembrance of our essence of Oneness/Source. Our souls basically agreed for the experience of feeling what it is like to have a sense of total separation from each other and from Source, to the extent where even the concept of a separation from “God” was later believed as factual. This altogether created a rich and highly polarized sensorial experience. With the intention of certain beings, our experience was later altered with an additional challenge, which was to experience the limitation of a hierarchical structure ruled by separation and egoistical purposes. The elitist group of individuals at the very top of this hierarchy is often referred to as the “Illuminati”, and are pushing forward their agenda for global control with an intellectual “New World Order” (Totalitarian world government and one world currency) -all while being aware of this threatening shift in consciousness. Humanity has experienced and remained caught up in this dormant state for a long while. This undergoing shift in consciousness stems from the fact that we have collectively agreed -at the soul level- to move beyond this collective amnesia to create a new, more conscious, harmonious and expansive experience, all while uncovering our natural state of creative limitlessness , love and peace . This is not a matter of blaming an elitist group for where we are at. We have agreed to overcome such a challenge as souls having a human experience, for us to learn and “grow up” from it. It is simply about finally taking responsibility for what we have created, and move on. 
“We are not called to fight the bad guy, harm it, or fear it. We are just called to dig within and find our sacred ground. To stand in full love by our bottom line. And as we do, the bad guy will very quickly scuttle away or drop its mask. Because it was never about the bad guy, but about us all along, about finding that essence inside, embracing all of who we are, when faced with any challenge. It is one of the ways in which we can honor the bad guy in his role of carrier of lessons, who is volunteering to wear a dark mask, so we may reach for more and find what was lost.”– Katie Gallanti Letting Go of the Old, Making Room for the New : A Shift of Vibration In the midst of these unique times of social upheaval and spiritual awakening, many individuals find themselves at a crossroad in their personal lives. Challenging situations are arising, and a discomfort in old routines is intensifying. Why is this happening? New energies of a higher consciousness are entering the earth plane, while our world is purging its energetic densities of a lower consciousness. This process is being sensed in our personal lives as well, bringing forth old emotional baggages or situations that challenge our traditional ways of thinking. Such emotions and discomforts will build up as long as we keep on missing the point of our soul’s call, which is to let go of the prevailing thoughts and beliefs that keep us from expanding towards the wholeness , love and infinite potential of who we truly are. As much as collective and personal challenges may feel like turmoil at first, it is merely a sign of old and unsustainable structures/comfort zones breaking down to make room for the new. If it is not about blaming and fighting this insanity and corruption, then where do we go from here? 
“Peace cannot be kept by force ; it can only be achieved by understanding.”– Albert Einstein When we shift our awareness towards the quantum construct of reality, we understand that everything we can possibly feel and think of is essentially a form and rate of vibration. Quantum physicists accurately describe the fundamental particles of reality as “ wave functions” . The reason for this abstract description is precisely because fundamental particles behave in a most abstract manner. Their existence emerge in waves in which lies only the potentiality for measurable outcomes. The word potentiality is key, because we now know through a number of scientific experiments (such as the double-slit experiment: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7YBmOk1nQw ) that the very presence of a conscious mind observing and/or intending to measure a particle, consequently determines the aspect and location in which it takes form. This quantum decoherence is scientifically known as “the measurement problem”. In other words, the fundamental nature of reality -the “Unified field”, consciousness, “God” or Source- is originally “open” to all potential outcomes. Yet our very consciousness is intimately hooked to the one that shall be experienced. As the physicist Dr. York Dobyns stated, “ Without us, (conscious beings) there would just be this expanding superposition of possibilities with nothing definite ever actually happening.” “Peace in ourselves, peace in the world.” -Thich Nhat Hanh That being said, everything in the universe and on earth vibrates at certain frequencies, including our thoughts, beliefs and emotions. We are literally molding our experienced reality via the power of our personal and collective perceptions, and our inner-state is reflected outwards. As Einstein said, we cannot solve a problem with the same level of consciousness that created it. This shift in consciousness is but a leap beyond the old dualistic consciousness we chose to experience as souls, towards the consciousness of Oneness, which is of a higher vibrational frequency -one of unconditional Love and understanding of who we really are beyond this physical realm. The angry, judgmental and reactive “egoic mind” actually attracts and emanates through it the same lower frequencies that keep humanity boxed in this low vibrational “matrix” of control. 
“It’s just a ride and we can change it any time we want. It’s only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings and money, a choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one.” – Bill Hicks Resuming It All In One Simple Analogy It is as if each and everyone of us are projectors responsible for the projections on our own blank walls. Most of us are unconsciously choosing to project a tape of violence, of hate, of segregation, of being powerless, and even of blame of the other 3 projectors for playing their hostile tape. Here lies the silliness, the ironicalness of justifying our own projection through blame. And this is where humanity is at: playing the same tape, over and over again, while most individuals are still blaming the projection instead of changing their own tape that is too playing a role in this projection. As much as we end up pointing fingers at the powers that be, they are no more or less powerful than we are. The only power they grant themselves, is through influencing our choice of the tapes we shall fill our projectors with. Yet we’ve always had the choice, despite us not being aware of it and taking responsibility for ourselves. This is the reason why Humanity is so slow in igniting true change. No one decides to look at their own tape. We seem to rather enjoy the comfort of holding on to the same stories and put them in “repeat” instead of transcending them; instead of BEING the change. The ego doesn’t want to know that it begins with ourselves, it doesn’t want us to dig into our own personal belief systems and let go of certain self-limitative mindsets or emotional baggages we carry. The ego is afraid of what can liberate us, and what can liberate us is ultimately ourselves. 
“First realize that your world is only a reflection of Yourself and then stop finding fault with the reflection.”– Nisargadatta. This is the illusion so many are still buying into. It is the belief that we have no influence over others and the world. We even think we have no influence over our own lives, no influence as the very projector of our own “blank wall”. This belief stems from the fact that we do not see ourselves at one with the world, at one with the people, and at one with ourselves. We see ourselves as a tiny little separated specs of dust with no power whatsoever through the emanation of our own state of being. Yet we are indeed all interconnected, we are all one. Our own consciousness directly impacts the collective consciousness, which is literally the motor of our experienced reality, it is the “projector” of it. Just as we can change our tape and project harmony on our own blank wall, we can choose to be who we truly are -our unconditioned self- and therefore reflect Peace, Love, Awareness, and all that which uplifts and unveils a more conscious understanding. Or… we can play the tape of blame, anger, hatred, victimization, pointing fingers, and never, ever looking at our own projections. We ultimately have the choice, right here, and right now.

20659,20659,"‘Moonlight,’ ‘La La Land’ and What an Epic Oscars Fail Really Says - The New York Times","Manohla Dargis, Wesley Morris and A.O. Scott","After Sunday night’s     when the presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced the wrong best picture, we asked the chief film critics of The New York Times, A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, and the Times critic at large, Wesley Morris, to share their reactions. A. O. SCOTT Wow, that “Bonnie and Clyde” sequel was totally nuts. But in its own way, last night’s spectacle  —   so relatively smooth, until all of a sudden it was anything but  —   represents a Hollywood watershed or, at least, like the original “Bonnie and Clyde,” the arrival of a new generation. The envelope   was painful, but it brought to the stage two directors in their 30s with five features between them and reminded the audience that Damien Chazelle and Barry Jenkins are not enemies. The grace with which the “La La Land” producers (Jordan Horowitz, in particular) handled the handoff  —   and the poise with which Mr. Jenkins and his producer, Adele Romanski, received the belated honor for “Moonlight”  —   should quell the facile polarization that followed the two movies throughout the awards season. And the messiness of the finale makes vivid what turned out to be the theme and the true political message of the night, which was inclusiveness. The   speeches were pointed at times but also muted, with the president’s name mostly unmentioned, and his policies opposed with     appeals. What held it all together was the idea that in Hollywood there is room for everyone. Even Mel Gibson! The two “Hacksaw Ridge” wins strike me as a reminder of the ideological diversity that has always existed in this bastion of liberalism. And the evening, at its best, was both a demonstration of, and an argument for, the value of pluralism, for expansive humanism as an antidote to narrowness and intolerance. MANOHLA DARGIS Most of the evening was weird and bad. (The stunt with the tourists was a   moment of Marie Antoinette obtuseness  —   ah, look, little people!) Then it turned weird and glorious. I shrieked when Mr. Horowitz announced that “Moonlight” had won (did you hear me?) but my heart also went out to the “La La Land” team. No matter how much I wanted “Moonlight” to win, I wouldn’t wish that kind of public spectacle on anyone, especially a group as pleasant as that behind “La La Land. ” Some on Twitter mocked the “La La Landers” for having tears in their eyes, so it’s lovely that the filmmakers from both movies were so much more gracious. Jimmy Kimmel could pick up some tips on manners and crisis management from Mr. Horowitz. More to the point, it would be great if the academy finally solved its host problem. Among other things, it would be nice if it found a host who both was actually interested in the art and didn’t mock the movies. (Make fun of the stars in the room  —   that’s what they’re there for.) At the very least, you would think the academy, which has made real if confusing strides toward inclusion, would understand that its   efforts seem a little hollow when a straight, white male host jokes about no one’s seeing a movie from a black director about gay black men. Optics, people, optics! As for Mr. Gibson, well, as the resident kooky conservative, he came off as a kind of proxy for President Trump. WESLEY MORRIS Just to reiterate: THAT HAPPENED, an event that  —   wait, “event” is too mild. A fiasco? Nightmare? Accidental slip of the entertainment psyche? Act of justice? Honestly, I don’t know. But something happened that seemed to simultaneously tell us who we were, are, believe ourselves to be. This is, what, the fourth time since November that the country has gathered for an evening of live television, only to be part of a   ceremony. After Sunday night, the presidential election, the Super Bowl and, to a different but related extent, the Grammys, I’ve officially come down with     stress disorder  —   Ooptsd, as in upside my head. What went down between the makers of “Moonlight” and “La La Land” was stunning and strange yet perversely, cosmically right for a night that began with Justin Timberlake’s telling Denzel Washington that surely he recognized the Bill Withers cover Mr. Timberlake was oozing his way through. That moment felt like a distillation of the politics surrounding Mr. Chazelle’s movie. That moment felt like the history of American entertainment distilled into an aside that I don’t even really blame Mr. Timberlake for. If we’ve learned nothing in the past 18 months, if not eight years, it’s that history is bigger than all of us and is always going to rat us out, forcing us to conform to its grip. But I’m with you guys about what gentlemen Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Horowitz were under the most bizarre of circumstances. That errant envelope deprived a proper reckoning of Mr. Jenkins’s achievement  —   and, of course  —   the academy’s. So let’s talk about that. “Moonlight” won best picture. That happened. Hollywood tried to wrest itself from history’s grip. And despite the bizarreness, that feels extraordinary, too. SCOTT “Moonlight” won best picture. That is an outcome I must say I never allowed myself to contemplate, even though I fell for the movie early and hard. I didn’t think it needed the award as proof of its merit  —   no piece of art ever really needs a prize in that way  —   and, in any case, I figured the academy would give it the standard   treatment: a screenwriting and supporting actor prize with the expectation of gratitude for just being included in the festivities. Which was exactly what seemed to be happening. And then (to echo Wesley) something else happened. We’re all still puzzling over what exactly it was. As Mr. Jenkins said: “But to hell with dreams. I’m done with it, because this is true. ” However awkwardly and backwardly the truth was revealed, “Moonlight” won best picture. That fact is something to hold onto, whether it portends a new direction or turns out to be an outlier. Unpredictability, in any case, seems to be the new normal. Some of our most beloved institutions  —   or maybe let’s just say our most begrudgingly tolerated, our most    as a matter of professional obligation  —   no longer function according to established rules and patterns. Or else they do (bad jokes, cheesy musical numbers, careful political statements, predictable winners) until all of a sudden they don’t. That kind of disruption can be upsetting, even horrifying. Last night showed that it can also be beautiful. “Moonlight” won best picture. I will never get tired of saying that. DARGIS But that’s the Oscars, isn’t it? They’re terrible and totally meaningless until the academy picks a movie we love. (Hello, “The Hurt Locker”!) Still, while the academy did give “Moonlight” best picture, the fact that Mr. Chazelle won best director suggests that last night was a squeaker. It may be that the academy’s push to diversify itself by adding new members has paid off, but some of the ugliness that aired during the interminable slog up to Sunday night indicates that the academy remains deeply divided. (Sound familiar?) Some of this was the usual campaign nonsense, but more than one white person also suggested that I love “Moonlight” only because it’s a black film. So, yes, the academy got it right, and “Moonlight” is now the first best picture winner to have been directed by an  . To turn back to that other milestone movie: When Kathryn Bigelow won best director for “The Hurt Locker” in 2010, some hoped that her historic win would serve as a breakthrough for women, but it hasn’t, and the numbers for female filmmakers are worse now. I don’t want to harsh our mellow, but I also don’t want to overpraise the academy for occasionally getting it right when the industry continues to get it so wrong. “Moonlight,” after all, wasn’t made by one of the big studios, which are more interested in superhero fantasies it was bankrolled by A24, a small, independent company. MORRIS There’s also that. While this was an important night for nonwhite and   filmmakers and actors, American movies continue to be appallingly bad for female filmmakers. Meanwhile, the major studios are out to lunch  —   or at the bank. A24 has the most exciting taste of any American studio,   or  . That “Moonlight” won doesn’t excuse anything. What happens the next year, or the year after, when it’s #OscarSoWhiteAgain? Over and over on Sunday, writers and actors and producers made statements about the urgency for more vivid representation, that we in the audience hunger for it, whether we live in Liberty City (the Miami neighborhood where “Moonlight” is set) or Manchester by the Sea. The three of us spend a few weeks talking about the Academy Awards and the rest of the year out in the marketplace, just watching movies. The real dream would be to arrive at a place where we can watch a film and argue about who’s in it instead of who isn’t. And can I also say, Manohla, that I really liked that moment with the tour group? If they’d been bused in against their will for our entertainment, I’d object. But those sights are, presumably, a version of what they paid that tour company to show them: the world through Jennifer Aniston’s sunglasses. When Mr. Kimmel asked that one woman, a    who her favorite star was, and she pointed to Mr. Washington, my heart melted. We’ve been talking about optics and history, and it felt meaningful to me that the bride, her groom and their complementary   personalities got to meet her favorite movie actor and that, in some way, Mr. Washington got to meet  —   and “marry”  —   them. For what it’s worth, he was nominated this year for playing an average guy. Sure, that tourist stunt culminated in three black people having a moment around a smartphone. But it was also a fantastical snapshot of a   ideal: weird, wedded bliss.",0
20660,20660,Trump Tower Surrounded By Dump Trucks In Anticipation Of Violence,Alex Ansary,"Trump Tower Surrounded By Dump Trucks In Anticipation Of Violence 11/09/2016 
DAILY CALLER 
The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has surrounded the perimeter of Trump Tower with reinforced dump trucks in anticipation of Election Day violence. 
The dump trucks flank the skyscraper on all sides, and are supplemented by guardrails and heavily armed police officers. This morning, the building was not open to the general public and traffic crawled through a narrow corridor of trucks and police. On the street, supporters and protesters stood for interviews with a burgeoning press corps camped across the street. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lives in a penthouse near the top of the building, which also serves as headquarters for his presidential campaign. (RELATED: Election Day Voting Has Begun – Who Is Winning?) 
Police told The Daily Caller News Foundation that the dumping beds are filled with sand, which adds weight to each truck, in effect making it impossible to run the barrier. Police decided to circle the Tower with trucks as a hedge against car bombs, or some such similar incendiary munition delivered by car. The fleet of trucks will travel with Trump this evening to surround the New York Hilton Midtown Manhattan Hotel, where Trump is hosting his victory rally. The NYPD maintained a presence around the hotel for several days, which is also closed to the public. 
Guests staying in the hotel on unrelated business must present their keycards at a security check-point before entering the premises. 
Similar security measures will attend Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s headquarters at the Javits Convention Center in Hell’s Kitchen this evening.",1
20661,20661,Federal Court Rules Texas’ ID Law Violates Voting Rights Act - The New York Times,Manny Fernandez and Erik Eckholm,"HOUSTON  —   A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled that Texas’ voter identification law, one of the strictest in the country, violated the Voting Rights Act and that the state must find ways to accommodate voters who face hardships in obtaining the necessary documents. Democrats and voting rights advocates hailed the ruling as a significant victory in one of the nation’s most closely watched voting rights cases. It was the fourth time in nearly four years that a federal court found that the Texas law discriminated against or disproportionately affected black and Hispanic voters. “The court got it right, recognizing the stink of discrimination,” said Trey Martinez Fischer, a state representative who is the chairman of the   Legislative Caucus, one of several minority groups, voters and Democratic lawmakers who sued Texas over the law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, found that the law had a discriminatory effect on blacks and Latinos, who often lack the forms of identification required under the Texas law. But the ruling did not strike down the law entirely, ruling instead that new procedures must be found to assist potential voters lacking the required identification. The ruling also sent back for reconsideration the question of whether Texas legislators had acted with a discriminatory purpose in passing the law in 2011, a finding that would have forced new judicial oversight of any changes in Texas election rules. Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican who defended the voter ID law against legal challenges when he was the state’s attorney general, said the court had come to the wrong conclusion. Republican lawmakers have long defended the law, saying it is needed to prevent voter fraud. “Voter fraud is real, and it undermines the integrity of the election process,” Mr. Abbott said in a statement. “Texas will continue to make sure there is no illegal voting at the ballot box. ” Passed by the   Legislature and signed by Gov. Rick Perry in 2011, the law took effect in 2013. It requires voters to present one of several forms of   identification, including a driver’s license, passport, military ID card or   license. A lower court judge found that about 608, 000 registered voters in Texas lacked the types of identification required by the law, and that a disproportionate number were black or Hispanic. The judge based that finding on testimony and data presented by experts during a 2014 trial in Corpus Christi. Texas’ lawyers disputed that figure. In its ruling, the Fifth Circuit asked a lower court judge to come up with a remedy that “disrupts voter identification rules for the 2016 election season as little as possible, yet eliminates” the law’s discriminatory effect on minority voters. One possible solution, the court noted, would be to allow   cards to be used as identification. The court also instructed the judge to   the evidence about whether the Texas Legislature intentionally discriminated against blacks and Hispanics, but encouraged the judge to wait until after the November election. The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, said in a statement that the state had a duty to safeguard elections. “Preventing voter fraud is essential to accurately reflecting the will of Texas voters during elections, and it is unfortunate that this   law, providing protections against fraud, was not upheld in its entirety,” Mr. Paxton said. Asked if the state would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, a spokeswoman for Mr. Paxton, Kayleigh Lovvorn, replied, “We are evaluating all of our options right now. ” Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, called the decision on Wednesday “huge in a symbolic way” for voting rights across the country. Since the Supreme Court weakened the federal Voting Rights Act in 2013, he noted, several states have been “ratcheting up” their voter ID requirements. What the Fifth Circuit  —   known as perhaps the country’s most conservative appeals court  —   has ruled is that “you can go too far with a voter ID law,” he said. “If Texas had been allowed to do what it’s been trying to do, that would be a green light for other states to try something similar,” Professor Hasen said. But he added that the plaintiffs’ victory was not as great as it would have been if the court had struck down the law. Myrna Pérez, the deputy director of the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which helped argue the plaintiffs’ case, called the ruling a “big victory. ” “The court said the law is discriminatory and needs to be fixed,’’ she said.",0
20662,20662,The Truth U.S. Government Does NOT Want You To Know About The War In Syria,Dikran Arakelian (noreply@blogger.com),"Share on Facebook The people of the world should ask Western leaders and their allies: Why are you prolonging this war? Why do you continue funding and enabling the terrorists? Isn't five years of civil war enough? Is overthrowing the Syrian government really worth so much suffering and death? WASHINGTON — (Analysis) In late April, President Barack Obama announced that 250 U.S. special operations troops are being deployed to Syria. Unlike the Russian and Iranian forces aiding anti-terrorism efforts in the country, the U.S. military personnel have entered Syria against the wishes of the internationally recognized government. In terms of international law, the United States has invaded Syria, a sovereign country and United Nations member state. This is the not the first time, though — Arizona Sen. John Mccain crossed into Syria without a visa to meet with anti-government fighters in 2013. While the new U.S. boots on the ground have officially been dispatched for the purpose of fighting Daesh (an Arabic acronym for the organization known in the West as ISIS or ISIL), they will most likely be working to achieve one of the Pentagon's longstanding foreign policy goals: violently overthrowing the Syrian government. As the terrorism of Daesh and other extremists grows more intense, and as millions of Syrians have become refugees, the heavy costs of the U.S. government's “regime change” operation in Syria should come into question. Education, Health Care And National Rebirth The independent nationalist Syrian government, now being targeted by Western foreign policy, was born in the struggle against colonialism. It took decades of great sacrifice from the people of Syria to break the country free from foreign domination — first by the French empire and later from puppet leaders. For the last several decades, Syria has been a strong, self-reliant country in the oil-rich Middle East region. It has also been relatively peaceful. Since winning its independence, Syria's Baathist leadership has done a great deal to improve the living standards of the population. Between 1970 and 2009, the life expectancy in Syria increased by 17 years. During this time period infant mortality dropped dramatically from 132 deaths per 1,000 live births to only 17.9. According to an article published by the Avicenna Journal of Medicine , these notable changes in access to public health came as a result of the Syrian government's efforts to bring medical care to the country's rural areas. A 1987 country study of Syria , published by the U.S. Library of Congress, describes huge achievements in the field of education. During the 1980s, for the first time in Syria's history, the country achieved “full primary school enrollment of males” with 85 percent of females also enrolled in primary school. In 1981, 42 percent of Syria's adult population was illiterate. By 1991, illiteracy in Syria had been wiped out by a mass literacy campaign led by the government. The name of the main political party in Syria is the “Baath Arab Socialist Party.” The Arabic word “Baath” literally translates to “Rebirth” or “Resurrection.” In terms of living standards, the Baathist Party has lived up to its name, forging an entirely new country with an independent, tightly planned and regulated economy. The Library of Congress’ Country Study described the vast construction in Syria during the 1980s: “Massive expenditures for development of irrigation, electricity, water, road building projects, and the expansion of health services and education to rural areas contributed to prosperity.” Compared to Saudi-dominated Yemen, many parts of Africa, and other corners of the globe that have never established economic and political independence, the achievements of the Syrian Arab Republic look very attractive. Despite over half a century of investment from Shell Oil and other Western corporations, the CIA World Factbook reports that about 60 percent of Nigerians are literate, and access to housing and medical care is very limited. In U.S.-dominated Guatemala, roughly 18 percent of the population is illiterate, and poverty is rampant across the countryside, according to the CIA World Factbook . What the Western colonizers failed to achieve during centuries of domination, the independent Syrian government achieved rapidly with help from the Soviet Union and other anti-imperialist countries. The Soviet Union provided Syria with a $100 million loan to build the Tabqa dam on the Euphrates River , which was “considered to be the backbone of all economic and social development in Syria.” Nine-hundred Soviet technicians worked on the infrastructure project which brought electricity to many parts of the country. The dam also enabled irrigation throughout the Syrian countryside. More recently, China has set up many joint ventures with Syrian energy corporations. According to a report from the Jamestown Foundation , in 2007 China had already invested “hundreds of millions of dollars” in Syria in efforts to “modernize the country's aging oil and gas infrastructure.” These huge gains for the Syrian population should not be dismissed and written off, as Western commentators routinely do when repeating their narrative of “Assad the Dictator.” For people who have always had access to education and medical care, it is to trivialize such achievements. But for the millions of Syrians, especially in rural areas, who lived in extreme poverty just a few decades ago, things like access to running water, education, electricity, medical care, and university education represent a huge change for the better. Like almost every other regime in the crosshairs of U.S. foreign policy, Syria has a strong, domestically-controlled economy. Syria is not a “client state” like the Gulf state autocracies surrounding it, and it has often functioned in defiance of the U.S. and Israel. It is this, not altruistic concerns about human rights, that motivate Western attacks on the country. Syria Needs Reform, Not Terrorism In 2012, Syria ratified a new constitution in response to the protests during the Arab Spring. In compliance with the new constitution, Syria held a contested election in 2014 , with international observers from 14 countries. One thing that distinguishes Syria from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, and various other U.S.-aligned regimes throughout the region is religious freedom. In Syria, Sunnis, Christians, Alawites, Druze, Jews, and other religious groups are permitted to practice their religious faith freely. The government is secular, and respects the rights of the Sunni Muslim majority as well as religious minorities. In addition to religious freedom, Syria openly tolerates the existence of two strong Marxist-Leninist parties. The Syrian Communist Party and the Syrian Communist Party (Bakdash) openly operate as part of the anti-imperialist coalition supporting the Baath Arab Socialist Party. Communists lead trade unions and community organizations in Damascus and other parts of the country. Though Syrian President Bashar Assad is an Alawite, his wife, Asma, is Sunni like the majority of the country. Historically, the biggest opponents of the Syrian government have been supporters of the Muslim brotherhood, with a bloody episode taking place in 1982. Hoping to heal the longstanding tension, President Assad has made many gestures of solidarity toward the Sunni community in recent years. He has made a point of engaging in religious practices not commonly done by Alawites, such as praying in mosques and studying the Quran. Shortly after fighting began in 2011, the Syrian government granted autonomy to Kurdish regions and transferred political authority to leftist Kurdish nationalist organizations . Syria's political system is certainly in need of reform and modernization, and representatives of the Syrian government such as U.N. Ambassador Bashar Al-Jaafari readily admit this. However, the civil war which has raged across Syria for the last five years, is not about reform, democratization or modernization. The BBC published a “guide to Syrian rebels” in 2013. Among them are not only the infamous “Islamic State” organization, which now horrifies the world, but also the Nusra Front, previously known as Al-Qaida in Syria. Other organizations with names like the “Islamic Front,” the “Islamic Liberation Front,” and the “Ahfad al-Rasoul Brigades” are also listed. While Western media presents the Syrian civil war as a “battle for democracy” led by “revolutionaries,” the primary goal of almost every insurgent organization is creating a Sunni caliphate — one that does not actually suit Sunnis though, but rather a perverted politicized version of Sunnism created by Saudi Arabia to ideologically control that region. The unifying religious perspective of the Syrian “rebels” is the interpretation of Sunni Islam practiced and promoted by Saudi Arabia, known as Wahhabism. Foreign Fighters, Chemical Weapons And Child Soldiers A large number of the insurgents are not Syrian. Impoverished people from throughout the Middle East have been recruited to fight against the Syrian government. Facilities in Bahrain train recruits to kill , and send them to Syria. Terrorist training facilities exist in many other U.S.-aligned Gulf states. Foreign fighters from as far away as Malaysia and the Philippines have been found among the ranks of the foreign Wahhabi insurgents that are trying to depose the Syrian government. The flow of violent insurgents into Syria is not accidental. It has been directly facilitated by the U.S. and its allies. The CIA has spent billions of dollars on training camps in Jordan for anti-government fighters . The Israeli government has made a point of aiding the Wahhabi extremists by providing them medical care in the occupied Golan Heights . Israel has also made a point of targeting allies of the Syrian government with airstrikes . While Western media has highlighted allegations that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons, Carla Del Ponte from the United Nations confirmed that the foreign-backed insurgents have long been been using sarin nerve gas and other chemical weapons. As the insurgents make life unlivable in Syria, kidnapping for ransom, bombing schools and hospitals, beheading people, torturing people, they do it with thousands of child soldiers among their ranks. Impoverished children from across the Arab world have been recruited to work toward violently overthrowing the Syrian government, according to UNICEF . Between 50 and 72 percent of the population lives in areas controlled by the Syrian government . Meanwhile, even USAID confirmed that the turnout in Syria's 2014 elections was more than 70 percent . While the barrage of foreign fighters and extremists, aligned with a minority of the population and armed by Western powers and their allies, is committed to bringing down the Syrian government, the Syrian people clearly disagree. The fact that the Syrian government remains strongly intact after a five-year onslaught shows that the country is dedicated to preserving its independence. Time magazine and other mainstream media outlets have even been forced to admit that President Assad is unlikely to be deposed. How Can The War End? As foreign fighters have flowed into Syria, hundreds of thousands of people have died over the last five years, and Western media continues to blame the Syrian government for the conflict. However, the war would have been a very short one if not for the foreign support given to the extremists. As an independent country with a centrally planned economy, Syria has serves as an example to the world. It has proven that without neoliberalism and Western economic domination, it is possible to improve living conditions and develop independently. The Syrian government has made huge sacrifices to aid the Palestinian people and their resistance against Israel, and this has been a contributing factor to Syria's inclusion on the State Department's State Sponsors of Terrorism list . Syria has close economic relations with Russia and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The war in Syria is not a domestic conflict. This is a war imposed on Syria by Israel, the U.S., and other Western capitalist powers. The primary promoter of Wahhabi extremism around the world has been the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a U.S. client state. Turkey and Jordan, U.S.-aligned countries bordering Syria, keep their borders open so that weapons, supplies and money can continue to flow into the hands of Daesh and other anti-government terrorists. At least 470,000 people are dead , and millions of others have been forced to become refugees, but Western leaders and their allies do not end their campaign. The insane chorus of “Assad Must Go” has transformed a small, domestic episode of unrest into a full-scale humanitarian crisis. The war has nothing to do with the calls for democratic reform and the peaceful protests of 2011. As Daesh now threatens the entire world, the consequences of the Wall Street regime change operation, promoted with “human rights” propaganda, are becoming far more extreme. The Syrian government rallies a coalition of Christians, Communists, Islamic Revolutionaries, and other forces who are fighting to maintain stability and defeat Takfiri terrorism. (The term “Takfiri” refers to groups of Sunni Muslims who refer to other Muslims as apostates and seek to establish a caliphate by means of violence.) The only real peace plan for Syria is for the U.S., France, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, and other powers to end their neoliberal crusade. The internationally recognized and recently re-elected Syrian government could easily defeat the insurgents if foreign meddling ceased. As U.S. media bemoans the humanitarian crisis, somehow blaming on the Syrian government and its president, and the U.S. directly sends its military forces into the country, the people of the world should ask Western leaders and their allies: Why are you prolonging this war? Why can't you just leave Syria alone? Why do you continue funding and enabling the terrorists? Isn't five years of civil war enough? Is overthrowing the Syrian government really worth so much suffering and death? Related:",1

E! ONLINE 
Lady Gaga took to Trump Tower early Wednesday morning to protest the results of the U.S. election. 
The “Bad Romance” singer, a well-known Hillary Clinton supporter, stood outside Donald Trump ‘s building and held a sign that read “Love trumps hate.” As the hours passed Tuesday night and it became clearer that Trump would win the presidency, Gaga tweeted, “In a room full of hope, we will be heard. Stand up for kindness, equality, and love. Nothing will stop us. Say a prayer America.” 
Gaga campaigned for Clinton earlier this week, attending a rally where she spoke of Clinton’s strengths. “She has a career in politics that spans decades of experience, education, leadership, and wisdom. She’s ready to be president,” she said. “She kept going and she kept fighting for women’s rights. She kept fighting for the care of our children. She kept fighting for those that are in need.”Trump’s victory was declared around 2:30 a.m. ET, and during his speech he praised Clinton’s efforts throughout the election. He said she was owed a “deep debt of gratitude” for all her hard work. “We will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will deal fairly with everyone. We will seek common ground, partnership not conflict,” he added in his speech. “America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our destiny.”",1
20664,20664,The Sleep of Separateness,Gillian,"Leave a reply 
Steve Taylor, Ph.D – From the standpoint of ordinary consciousness, separateness seems to be a basic part of the human condition. Most human beings experience themselves as egos trapped inside their own mind-space, observing a world which seems to be out there, on the other side of their skulls. As a result, the normal human state is one of aloneness. We’re always onlookers rather than participants. We can communicate with other people by speaking, writing or gesturing, but they will never be able to truly know us, or to share our thoughts and feelings. Our inner being will always be sealed off from them. 
Ego-separation also creates a sense of incompleteness. Because we’re separate from the world, we’re like fragments which have broken off from the whole, and so feel a sense of insufficiency. There s a kind of hole inside us which we spend most of our lives trying to fill (but very rarely manage to), like cats who were taken away from their mother at birth and who are always hankering for affection and attention to try to compensate for a sense of lack. Born-again Christians mean something close to this when they say that there is a god-shaped hole inside us although in my view traditional religion can’t fill the hole either, only provide the same (ultimately incomplete) consolation as wealth or success. 
As a result of this aloneness and incompleteness, we don’t feel completely at home in the world. We’re not completely rooted here, and so feel somehow adrift, as if we don’t fully belong, like people who have travelled around the world so much that they no longer feel at home anywhere. Whereas traditional indigenous peoples seem to perceive the world as a benign and benevolent place, to us it seems indifferent and even vaguely malevolent. 
In addition, our ego-isolation generates a basic sense of insecurity and insignificance. Our own ego is so tiny and so flimsy in the face of the enormous world out there , like a tiny wooden beach shack at the edge of a vast ocean. We feel dwarfed by the sheer weight of the phenomena and events taking place out there . How can we possibly have any significance in relation to them? How can this fragile entity inside our heads stand up to the might of the world? The Wider Effects of Separateness 
However, the effects of this separateness reach far beyond the individual. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the sense of separateness is the root cause of the constant conflict, warfare and oppression which have blighted human history. The human sense of incompleteness generates a craving for possessions, power and status, as a way of trying to complete ourselves and compensate for our inner discord. We try to complete ourselves – and make ourselves significant – by gaining power over other people or by collecting wealth and possessions. 
This desire for wealth and power is the root cause of warfare and oppression too, coupled with the reduced empathy which separateness causes. The separate self walls us off from other human beings, makes it difficult for us to ‘feel with’ them and to experience the world from their perspective. This makes it possible for us to be violent and cruel to other people, since we can’t sense the suffering we cause them. So we oppress and exploit them in the service of our own desires oppress women, members of lower classes or castes, different races, so that we can gain more power, status and wealth. 
The sense of separateness is also the root cause of our abuse of the environment. It means that we experience a sense of ‘otherness’ to nature, and that we can’t sense its aliveness, and as a result we don’t feel any qualms about exploiting and abusing it. Why Separateness? 
I wouldn’t exactly say that separateness is an illusion, as many non-duality teachers would. Not an illusion but an aberration – something which exists but shouldn’t. Children don’t experience separateness; they exist in a state of natural relatedness to the world. This is one of the reasons why childhood is so wonderful because the child feels connected to everything around them, in a participatory flow with all experience, with no in here or out there. 
There are also many other peoples in the world who even as adults don’t exist in a state of separateness. Most of the world s indigenous peoples don’t see themselves as separate to their environment. They feel a strong sense of connection to nature, an awareness that they are a part of the web of creation (and one which is no more important than any other). 
As Tim Ingold writes of the Batek Negritos of Malaysia, for example, They see themselves as involved in an intimate relationship of interdependence with the plants, animals and hala [spirits] (including the deities) which inhabit their world. Or as the Cherokee Indian scholar Rebecca Adamson points out, for indigenous peoples the environment is perceived as a sensate, conscious entity suffused with spiritual powers through which the human understanding is only realised in perfect humility before the sacred whole. The Hopi use the term Novoitti for the concept of living in harmony with nature, while the Tlingit (also of North America) call it Shogan. 
The anthropologist Lucien Levy-Bruhl believed that essential characteristic of native peoples was that the limits of their individuality are variable and ill-defined. He noted that, rather than existing as self-sufficient individual entities, indigenous peoples sense of identity was bound up with their community and their land. He cites reports of native peoples who used the word I when speaking of their group and others who see their land as an extension of their self, so that being forced away from their land would be tantamount to death. (This is why native peoples are often prepared to commit suicide rather than leave their lands.) 
The naming practices of certain peoples suggest this too. For us, a name is a permanent label which defines our individuality and autonomy. But Australian Aborigines, for example, do not have fixed names which they keep throughout their lives. Their names regularly change, and include those of other members of their tribe. Other native peoples use tekonyms terms which describe the relationship between two people instead of personal or kinship names. 
The sense of separateness seems to be a quirk of our psychological development. For us, it slowly develops as we move into adolescence, becoming firmly established in our late teens. The ego develops as a structure, creating a sense of inner-ness and walling us off. 
Witness the massive change which occurs when a child enters adolescence. Especially with boys, the freshness and joy of childhood gives way to dullness and confusion. After being a part of the glorious flow of experience, we’re suddenly outside the world, alone inside our own mental space. This is why adolescents have such a strong need for belonging. 
Their new sense of separation makes them feel so vulnerable that they need to reinforce their identity by being a part of groups or gangs, or by following fashions. More bleakly, this is also why most murders are committed by young men, in response to perceived slights or insults. With their new fragile sense of identity, young men are liable to take offence at any kind of trivial affront, making them feel belittled and creating an instant desire to take revenge and regain their lost status. 
I remember this transition clearly from my own adolescence. After a carefree childhood, I suddenly felt locked inside myself, alone with thoughts and feelings which no one else would ever be able to experience. Along with that, I felt an acute self-consciousness. I was aware of every movement I made and every word I spoke, so that I couldn’t do anything naturally anymore. I felt exposed when I walked down the street, aware that people could have been looking at me from their windows. 
As they grow into adulthood, most people deal with the fragility and vulnerability of the self by taking on roles and attachments. They take on the roles of their jobs, attach themselves to certain beliefs strengthening their identity with labels such as socialists, atheists or muslims or attach themselves to ambitions, to knowledge they’ve accumulated, to their self-image as important or powerful people, or emotionally attach themselves to other people These roles and attachments become the scaffolding of the ego, propping it up and at the same time, they reinforce separation, making the individual walled off. Awakening From the Sleep of Separateness 
However, no matter how far into separateness we fall, in a sense it’s never more than superficial. No matter how strong the ego becomes, it’s never more than a construct. Everyone experiences moments when separateness temporarily fades, and we become part of the unity again. These are what I refer to as awakening experiences. They frequently occur when we’re walking amongst natural surroundings, when we’re dancing or running, during or after sex, listening to or playing music. In these situations, the normal chattering of the ego which is the normal fuel of the ego, maintaining it as a structure becomes quiet, leading to a softening of its boundaries. Separateness dissolves and we’re afloat on the ocean of Being again, immersed in the glorious is-ness and aliveness of the world. 
Tellingly, in these moments there is always an identity shift. We feel that we’ve become someone else, a deeper, more grounded self which seems more authentically you. The ego-self we identified with before seems like an imposter, a limited and shallow trickster who somehow deluded us into thinking it was our identity. 
There are also many cases of extreme loss or intense turmoil, when all of the ego’s building blocks its roles and attachments are broken away. A person might be diagnosed with cancer and told they only have a few months left to live; an alcoholic might reach rock bottom and be on the point of suicide; a person might become seriously disabled through injury or illness; or they might suffer from the trauma of bereavement, depression, the destruction of hopes and beliefs, and so on. In most cases, these forms of loss simply bring sadness and suffering, but for a minority of individuals, they can trigger a spiritual awakening. With all its scaffolding broken down, the normal ego-self dissolves away, and our deeper, truer self emerges in its place, like a butterfly from a caterpillar. The person feels re-born, like a different person inhabiting the same body, with a new sense of meaning and connection. 
In all of these experiences, there is a sense of coming home, back to our original oneness, the harmony which both as an individual and as a species we fell away from. It was always there it is always here. It’s just that our separate selves deluded us into thinking we were asleep.

20665,20665,America thick as pig shit,nan,"Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Gary Stanton America thick as pig shit 
The American electorate is as thick as fucking pig shit, it has been confirmed this morning. 
When voters were asked to choose between lots and lots of pain and slightly less pain, a majority asked if they could have the options explained again more slowly. 
The night ended with red faces in the Democrat camp and Meryl Streep refusing to get down from the roof of a multi-storey car park in Washington. 
Wildly inaccurate polls that preceded the vote were explained when computer-illiterate pollsters admitted to adding things up on their fingers. 
Political analyst, Chuck Williams, told us, “Even an amoeba is able to respond to an unpleasant stimulus such as Trump’s opinions on immigrants and women by adopting a worried face and scurrying away in the opposite direction. 
“However, if you take the metaphorical amoeba that is the American voting public and repeat the same repulsive codswallop, it just sits there with a big stupid grin all over its rudimentary face. 
“In some cases, it even moves closer.” 
Williams blames what he calls the Fifty Shades effect, insisting the American public are either stupid or masochistic or both. 
He added, “The American public has just voted to be fucked in the ass by a sociopathic narcissist, and it seems that like a badly written fanfic character, they actually wanted it.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE! There are currently ",1
20666,20666,Battle Over New Bus Terminal Threatens to Paralyze Port Authority’s Board - The New York Times,Patrick McGeehan,"After three years of planning for a new bus terminal in Manhattan, the commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey still agree that New York City badly needs one. But, as the nasty debate over paying for it has spilled out in public, they appear to agree on little else. The discord has threatened to paralyze the board that oversees the agency and that is responsible for transportation projects critical to the region. When the time came on Friday to publish the board’s monthly agenda, the agency punted, hinting that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, might instruct his appointees not to conduct any business, just as he did before the board’s previous meeting. When the agenda for the meeting this week finally appeared on Monday afternoon, it suggested that politicians from the opposite sides of the Hudson River had still not bridged their differences. They may still be billions of dollars apart in their views on how the agency should spend the money it collects from tolls and transportation fees. The battle over the bus terminal shows just how quickly the Port Authority can fall into the kind of dysfunction that allowed appointees of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, to spitefully close lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013. Mr. Christie has since stepped back from the agency, but the tussle for influence over its vast finances has remained fierce. It has caused at least one of Mr. Cuomo’s associates to quit abruptly and has drawn in city and state officials from both states, as well as Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat. Accusations of   bargaining have flown back and forth. Mr. Nadler went so far as to question the motivations of the agency’s chairman, John J. Degnan, and to call on him to recuse himself from deliberations over the bus terminal. On Monday, Mr. Nadler declined to discuss his allegation. But he said of Mr. Degnan, “All I do know is that the New York people at the Port Authority, and the governor’s people, they all say that he’s been just dictatorial on everything. ” Angered by the attacks, Mr. Degnan, a Christie appointee, has planted his feet and squared up for a fight. “I am the chairman of the Port Authority,” he said. “The Port Authority needs to work with the governors, but it should not be submissive to either one of them. ” No decisions have been made about how or where to replace the    terminal, a destination widely derided as forlorn, and one that is overrun by over 115, 000 daily commuters from New Jersey and beyond. But there is general agreement that the solution must include a new or revamped terminal within a few blocks of the existing one, on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. The crux of the current dispute is how much money the authority should commit to the project. The commissioners have been wrestling all year with a revision of the agency’s   capital plan. That budget, drawn up in 2014, did not include any money for the bus terminal. Facing cost estimates of $3. 7 billion to $15. 3 billion, Mr. Degnan has demanded that at least $3. 5 billion of the capital plan be designated for the terminal. But on Tuesday, Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said the governor would agree to that only if at least   of the total was effectively contributed by New Jersey. “Asking New Yorkers to shoulder the burden of a $10 billion project many of them won’t ever use is a bad deal and a ” he said. Jameson W. Doig, a professor emeritus at Princeton who has chronicled the history of the Port Authority, said he had been told that Mr. Cuomo did not want his appointees to attend the board meeting in November while the dispute was unresolved. One of them, Steve Cohen, who was the vice chairman of the board, skipped the meeting and resigned. Mr. Cohen was the second Cuomo appointee to depart in the last few months, leaving the New York commissioners outnumbered, six to four. The previous vice chairman, Scott Rechler, left this fall. Mr. Doig said although there had been gridlock at the agency in the past, he could not recall another instance of a governor’s asking commissioners to boycott a board meeting. “We know that Governor Cuomo has been very interested in having substantial funds to carry out projects that he thinks are important,” he said, alluding to Mr. Cuomo’s championing of an overhaul of La Guardia Airport. “From his point of view, the bus terminal is not one of them. ” Mr. Azzopardi said: “The law provides that either governor can veto any action of the Port Authority. So if someone wants to run the Port Authority, they should run for governor. ” Mr. Nadler said he thought $2 billion was fair because the Port Authority was including the same amount in the capital plan for a project to build train tunnels under the Hudson River, known as Gateway, which is critical to improving travel in the region. No draft of the revised capital plan has been released, and the agency has not said how much would go for the Gateway project. Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the agency, said late on Monday that he had no answers to questions about the capital plan. It was not clear whether the commissioners would have answers when they gather for their monthly board meeting on Thursday. The delayed agenda indicated that they would vote on a resolution to publish a draft of the capital plan by Dec. 19. After that, the resolution says, the agency would invite the public to join in the debate over how it should spend more than $28 billion in capital funds. Public hearings will be held before any final decisions are made, according to the resolution. That is a very different process than the Port Authority has used in the past. The authority adopted a policy of holding public hearings on its plans after ramming through an unpopular steep toll increase in 2011. The public hearings are likely to draw crowds, given the strong reactions to the agency’s previous decisions about the bus terminal. New Jersey officials fear the agency will decide to build a satellite depot in their state, forcing many bus riders to transfer to PATH trains to reach Manhattan. Residents of the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood, which surrounds the terminal, fear eminent domain will be invoked to take private property for the project. Last week, a group of New Jersey officials gathered in Hackensack, N. J. to call for a commitment to fully fund a new terminal on the West Side of Manhattan that would preserve a   ride for commuters. Stephen M. Sweeney, a New Jersey Democrat who is the president of the State Senate, said $2 billion would be too little to ensure that the project moved forward. State Senator Loretta Weinberg, a Bergen County Democrat, said $2 billion was “ not nearly enough to guarantee a commitment to the bus terminal. ” Ms. Weinberg said she thought that she and the New Jersey officials had reached the framework of an agreement more than a month ago, and was caught   when the debate turned hostile. Ms. Weinberg said she hoped “cooler heads will prevail” when the commissioners meet and try to wrap up the capital plan. Mr. Doig said he believed that the infighting was avoidable. “The kind of severe political meddling that we’ve seen in the last six years is not inescapable,” he said. “You need to have governors who think about the important issues the region faces as opposed to thinking, Let’s find a way to use the Port Authority and its money to enhance my reputation. ”",0
20667,20667,Tom Hayden’s Haunting,Jim Kavanagh,"Email 
As an old SDS-er, I found it hard to see Tom Hayden go. However meandering his path, he was at the heart of radical history in the 60s, an erstwhile companion, if not always a comrade, on the route of every boomer lefty. 
One of his finer moments for me, which I’ve never seen mentioned (including among this week’s encomia) since he wrote it, was his 2006 article , published on CounterPunch with an introduction by Alexander Cockburn, in which he apologized for a “descent into moral ambiguity and realpolitick that still haunts me today.” It would be respectful of Hayden’s admirers and critics, on the occasion of his passing, to remember which of his actions “haunted” him the most. 
The title of the article says it clearly: “I Was Israel’s Dupe.” In the essay, Hayden apologizes for his support of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, which was for him that “descent into moral ambiguity” More importantly, he explains why he did it, in a detailed narrative that everyone should read. 
Hayden sold out, as he tells it, because, in order to run as a Democratic candidate for the California State Assembly, he had get the approval of the influential Democratic congressman Howard Berman. Berman is a guy who, when he became Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was proud to tell the Forward that he took the job because of his “interest in the Jewish state” and that: “Even before I was a Democrat, I was a Zionist.” 
Hayden had to meet with Howard’s brother Michael, who, acting as “the gatekeeper protecting Los Angeles’ Westside for Israel’s political interests,” told Hayden: “I represent the Israeli Defense Forces”—a sentence that could serve as the motto of most American congress critters today. The “Berman-Waxman machine,” Hayden was told, would deign to “rent” him the Assembly seat on the “one condition: that I always be a ‘good friend of Israel.’” 
But American congressmen were not the only “gatekeepers” through whose hands Hayden had to pass before being allowed to run for Congress. Other “certifiers” included “the elites, beginning with rabbis and heads of the multiple mainstream Jewish organizations,… the American-Israel Political Action Committee (AIPAC), …[and].. Israeli ambassadors, counsels general and other officials.“ 
In fact, Hayden had to, in his words, be “declared ‘kosher’ by the ultimate source, the region’s representative of the state of Israel,” Benjamin Navon, Israel’s Counsul-general in Los Angeles. 
In other words, in this article Hayden was describing, in an unusually concrete way, how the state of Israel, through its state officials and their compliant American partners, was effectively managing—exercising veto power over Democratic Party candidates, at the very least—American elections down to the level of State Assembly . In any constituency “attuned to the question of Israel, even in local and state elections,” Hayden knew he “had to be certified ‘kosher,’ not once but over and over again.” 
This experience prompted Hayden to express a “fear …that the ‘Israeli lobby’ is working overtime to influence American public opinion on behalf of Israel’s military effort to ‘roll back the clock’ and ‘change the map’ of the region.” Hayden warned of the “trepidation and confusion among rank-and-file voters and activists, and the paralysis of politicians, especially Democrats,” over support of Israel. He vowed to “not make the same mistake again,” and said: “Most important, Americans must not be timid in speaking up, as I was 25 years ago.” 
Whatever else he did—and he was never particularly radical about Palestine—this article was a genuinely honest and unusual intervention, and it deserves a lot more notice—as a moment in Tom Hayden’s history and that of the American left—than it has got. Looking back and regretfully acknowledging that one had been duped and morally compromised by what seemed the least troublesome path 25 years earlier, saying “I woulda, shoulda, coulda done the right thing,” is a haunting moment for anyone. Doing it in a way that exposes in detail how a foreign country constantly manipulates American elections over decades is worthy of everyone’s notice. 
I doubt Hillary and her Democratic supporters will have anything to say about this “interference “in American elections, even local and state. But I do hope many of those who are touched by the loss of Tom Hayden heed these words from him, and don’t wait another 25 years to overcome their “fear and confusion” about saying and doing the right thing regarding the crimes of Israel, troublesome as that might be.",1

It is yet another example of the agenda promoting the blurring of the genders. And they are now aiming children. Last year, I published an article entitled The Agenda Behind Bruce Jenner’s Transformation where I explained how Jenner’s sex change was intentionally publicized and celebrated because it was part of a larger agenda promoting the blurring of the genders. This agenda is even more obvious and insidious this year because there’s a conscious effort to reach children. A child with the word ‘Transgender’ stamped across the screen. This sums up what mass media has been about these past years. Click to enlarge Although ‘Amy’ is played by an actress, the story claims that she used to be boy named Ben. Click to enlarge CBBC’s series Just a Girl is the latest baffling attempt at normalizing, trivializing and even celebrating the completely unnecessary process that is childhood sex change. Freely available online on CBBC’s website, the series even teaches children about taking hormones and puberty-halting drugs. Do we truly know the effects of such drugs on one’s developing body and brain chemistry. Of course not. Why is this radical and aberrant process promoted to children? Do children need to know about hormone blockers? AND WHERE ARE THE PARENTS?! Click to enlarge In my humble opinion, parents who subject their children to radical treatments such as hormone blockers and sex change surgery should be trialed for child abuse. Instead, these things are actually encouraged in shows aimed at children and society is following suit. Some NHS clinics (such as the Tavistock Centre in North London) have been prescribing hypothalamic blockers to children as young as nine. In another case, such as a seven-year-old boy was ordered to be removed from his mother’s care as ‘she was raising him as female’. This is what the elite wants to see: Confused children wondering if they should change sex. HOW ABOUT YOU GO OUTSIDE AND RIDE A BIKE OR SOMETHING? Here are quotes taken from Just a Girl . In Just A Girl, Amy says: ‘When I was born, Mum said Dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football. But Mum knew I was different. She realised early on that I was born in the wrong body.’ She adds: ‘My Mum supported me when I did a PowerPoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that I wasn’t going to come to school in boys’ clothes any more, but girls’ clothes. I wasn’t Ben, I was Amy.’ Later Amy is shown telling a friend, Josh – a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl – that she is on hormone blockers, saying it took ‘ages’ to get them after ‘loads of tests and talks at the clinic’. ‘Once they realised I was trans for real, [I] got them,’ she says. In another entry, Amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called Liam, but confides: ‘Liam thinks I’m just a girl, but I’m not. I’m trans. And what’s he going to say if he finds out? Stop being my friend? Why? I’m still me, aren’t I?’ This last bit appears to be taken straight from a neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) handbook. The goal: To confuse young minds about sex and gender. Backlash",1

20670,20670,How to Use Google to Plan Your Trip - The New York Times,Justin Sablich,"Google Maps revolutionized how you get from point A to point B. Google Trips aims to to do the same for how you vacation. The smartphone app, released on Monday, uses what it already knows about you, based on data it has collected from your Gmail account, and combines it with established features from its other offerings, like Destinations, and its large database of   reviews. The goal, as Google puts it, is to create a “personalized tour guide in your pocket. ” “We wanted to reduce the hassle and help travelers enjoy their   vacations,” Stefan Frank, the app’s product manager, wrote on Google’s blog. The app can do a lot, probably equal to what four travel apps could do, but it can’t do everything. Here’s what you need to know before setting off on your first Google trip. It’s   (Only if You Use Gmail) After setting up the app using your Gmail account, you can create your first trip  —   simply search for the destination city and put in your dates. If you’re hitting multiple cities, you can add those as well. If the app has enough of your data, you may already have the trip listed. In that case, you do not have to create a new one, just jump into the existing trip and make changes as you see fit. The app has complete guides for more than 200 major cities, and each of those has six main features: Reservations, Things to Do, Saved Places, Day Plans, Food  Drink and Getting Around. There are guides for most other cities as well, but you won’t get Day Plans and Getting Around options for those smaller locations. Reservations will show you the flight, hotel and car rental information that it collects from the Gmail account you registered with. You’ll need to forward any reservations made using your work email to your Gmail account if you want those to show up. It’s also worth noting that you cannot make reservations directly from the app  —   it shows only the reservations you already made. I had nothing definite planned, but for testing’s sake, I tried out a hypothetical trip to Boston. Things to Do is a good place to start. It recommends destinations broken down by category, from the simple “Indoors” vs. “Outdoors” to   labels like “Newbury Street Shops” and   ones like “Selfie Spots. ” If you see something you like, hit the star icon and it’ll add it to your Saved Places. This breakdown and the ability to save will look familiar to anyone who has used Gogobot. Day Plans are suggested themed itineraries. For example, Historic Boston has 10 sites mapped out, each one including all of the information you’d see if you found it on Google search (reviews, open and close time) and the travel time between each stop. Food  Drink will give you a basic overview of the area’s specialties, and then suggest establishments based on categories like “” “food with a view,” “cocktail specialists” and many more. Getting Around has all the transportation information you could think of. You get all of your airport options, from public transportation directions to costs of taxis. It’s a   You’ve probably already saved some dough by using the offline feature on Google Maps. You can do the same here by downloading each trip to your phone. And all the information will be accessible even if you’re not connected to the internet or to cellular service. You won’t need to eat into your data with Google Trips, or be stuck if your vacation is in a remote location with no cell service. Using the app with a data or   connection does have a few perks. If the weather takes a turn for the worse, the app will suggest indoor activities. It’ll also show whether a place is open or closed in real time. But you’re not missing much in offline mode. It’s Customizable  If you’re strapped for time, the suggested Day Plans seem to have something for everyone. But you can also customize each recommended plan by adding or deleting stops, or create one from scratch. The app will also suggest places to visit based on what it knows about you (which, by now, is a lot). It had Fenway Park on the top of my “For You” list, since it has rightfully concluded that I’m a baseball fan. Then again, “Boston With Kids” was another suggested Day Plan and I don’t have any of those. It’s Kind of Creepy Before you create your first trip, you’ll see some of your previous trips that you didn’t even share. That’s because it has already pulled in information from your Gmail account, so it knows which hotels you stayed in and where you rented a car from and stores this information under Reservations. This could be useful if you plan on returning some day. But if you’d rather not have the stroll down memory lane, you can delete previous trips quite easily. It’s also not perfect. Occasional suggestions miss the mark. Also, I recently returned from a weekend away and it had this week blocked off for me as a trip to New York, which is where I live. It’s Free There is no fine print here. As long as you don’t consider the fact that Google now has a new way of using your data as a price to pay, there is no monetary charge for using the app. This is significant if you compare it to similar travel apps like TripIt, which costs $49 per year for its premium service.",0

In 2002, Elizabeth Smart was abducted during the night at knifepoint from her bedroom at only 14-years-old.
Her kidnapping quickly garnered national media attention. Her media savvy parents worked overtime to keep her story in the news throughout the ordeal.
During her 9 months in captivity she was raped repeatedly, often as many as 3-4 times per day. Each day was a mental and physical war for her to survive at the hands of her kidnapper and rapist, Brian David Mitchell.

Now as a parent herself, Smart has realized how horrible the kidnapping was for her parents.
“When I go back to my own situation, I almost think it was worse for my parents than for me because I knew that I was alive, but they didn’t know,” she told People magazine.
“I always knew how much they loved me, but until I had my own daughter I didn’t realize how all-consuming that is. The worst thing in the world would be if something happened to my little girl,” she continued.
Smart has made it her life’s work as a reporter, teacher and activist to make sure other parents, families, victims and survivors are supported, “Nobody should have to go through the aftermath of a terrible crime alone.”

20672,20672,"Kellyanne Conway Promotes Ivanka Trump Brand, Raising Ethics Concerns - The New York Times",Richard Pérez-Peña and Rachel Abrams,"WASHINGTON  —   The White House on Thursday “counseled” Kellyanne Conway, one of President Trump’s top advisers, in an unusual show of displeasure after she urged consumers to buy fashion products marketed by Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter. Legal experts said Ms. Conway might have violated a federal ethics rule against endorsing products or promoting an associate’s financial interests. “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would say,” Ms. Conway said in a Thursday morning interview with Fox News, speaking from the White House briefing room. “I’m going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody you can find it online. ” Sean Spicer, the president’s press secretary, would not elaborate on what the counseling entailed. Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Ms. Conway’s comments were “wrong, wrong, wrong, and there’s no excuse for it. ” Mr. Chaffetz  —   who so far had not acted on calls since Election Day to investigate ethics issues related to Mr. Trump  —   and the panel’s ranking Democrat, Elijah Cummings, formally asked the Office of Government Ethics for an inquiry. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Public Citizen, nonprofit advocacy groups, sent their own requests to the ethics office to investigate whether Ms. Conway’s comments went over the line. The director of the office, Walter M. Shaub Jr. has said publicly that the president needs to do more to separate himself from his businesses. Federal ethics rules state that an employee of the government’s executive branch cannot use public office for personal gain or to endorse products or services on behalf of friends or relatives. Legal experts said Ms. Conway, whose title is counselor to the president, appeared to have violated that and possibly other    rules, which do not apply to the president and vice president, but do apply to their staffs. The president and the Trump Organization continue to be targets of criticism  —   and formal requests for investigation by Democrats in Congress  —   over potential conflicts of interest because of their global business operations. A particular focus of Democratic lawmakers in Congress is Mr. Trump’s lease with the federal government on the Old Post Office building in Washington, redeveloped as the Trump International Hotel. The hotel and    Mr. Trump’s club in Palm Beach, Fla. are among the Trump properties critics see as profiting from a surge in interest because of his presidency. A lawsuit is also pending in federal court in New York, alleging that Mr. Trump is violating the Constitution by accepting payment from foreign governments at his hotels and golf courses around the world. It is one of dozens of lawsuits filed against him in recent weeks. The Trumps argue that they have taken major steps to avoid potential conflicts, including withdrawing from more than a dozen planned international deals. But the family is moving ahead with other plans, like the launch of a new hotel brand, Scion, which they hope will develop about 30 hotels around the United States, requiring approval from local governments that rely on federal aid. Ms. Conway was responding to a Trump family clash with Nordstrom, the department store chain, which has dropped Ms. Trump’s line. On Wednesday, the president used his personal and White House Twitter accounts to lash out at Nordstrom, saying that the company had treated his daughter “so unfairly. ” Those comments are the latest in a series of ethical questions about the relationship between his official role and his family’s interests. Ms. Conway’s remarks amounted to “using your government position as kind of a walking billboard for products or services offered by a private individual,” said Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard. “She is attempting quite crudely to enrich Ivanka and therefore the president’s family. ” Ordinarily, such conduct might be handled with a letter of reprimand, though it could lead to termination, legal experts said, but those decisions are largely up to the individual agency. “I think this is a violation, but I’d like to hear an argument as to why it’s not,” said Lawrence M. Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit advocacy group, who was formerly the top lawyer and ethics officer at the Federal Election Commission. “She was speaking on behalf of the White House, in her official position, which makes it more serious. ” Richard W. Painter, chief ethics counsel under President George W. Bush, said Ms. Conway’s conduct would not have been tolerated in that administration. Recent events show that the president and the people close to him do not intend “to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the Trump family business,” he said. Of Mr. Trump’s aides, Mr. Painter said, “Instead of trying to push him back on this, they’re jumping in this and shilling for the businesses alongside him. ” Nordstrom, one of several retailers to reduce or eliminate its ties to Ms. Trump’s line of clothes, jewelry and accessories, said its decision to do so was based purely on sales performance. But deep division in views of Mr. Trump have put retailers in a bind. Critics of the president have called for a boycott of   products and the stores that sell them, while his supporters have called for a boycott of stores that drop them. Ms. Conway said that Ms. Trump was being targeted by people who disliked her father. “They’re using her to get to him,” Ms. Conway said on Thursday. The president and his daughter have pledged to distance themselves from their various businesses. Ms. Trump has stepped away from her leadership role at the Ivanka Trump brand, and she and her father have resigned as executives at the Trump Organization. But recent events underscore the strong financial ties that remain. Mr. Trump will continue to receive reports on the performance of the Trump Organization, while Ms. Trump has given no indication that she plans to sell her brand. Much as her father has over the years, Ms. Trump licenses her name to various partners that manufacture and market her products. A day after Nordstrom pulled Ms. Trump’s products from its website, Neiman Marcus did the same, alluding to poor sales. Ms. Trump has no official role in the administration, but her father has included her in meetings with industry and government leaders, and her husband, Jared Kushner, is an adviser to the president. Acting as a surrogate for her father last year, she drew free attention to the Ivanka   products  —   sheath dresses, heels and jewelry  —   that she sometimes wore. That commingling created a thicket of ethical issues that became more pointed after the election. The dress she wore at the Republican National Convention, for example, was among the items presented to apparel buyers in Japan last year, as Ms. Trump’s company was finalizing a deal with a Japanese clothing company whose largest shareholder is a   bank. That deal was in its final stages when Ms. Trump joined her father’s meeting with Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in November. A representative for Ms. Trump said she later withdrew from that deal. And in November, after her father’s election and the day after she appeared on “60 Minutes,” Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry sent an email to fashion journalists with a photo from the interview, alerting them that the    bangle she wore in the picture was available for $10, 800. The jewelry line later apologized.",0

20674,20674,How Your State and Local Tax Dollars Paid for Private Equity Firm TPG’s Elton John Apperance,Yves Smith,"by Yves Smith 
With all the big and small grifting that goes on in private equity, we haven’t bothered calling out a practice that is pervasive and well known in the private equity community and authorized by the agreements that the limited partners sign with the general partners. Yet it will likely stick in the craw of most public pension fund beneficiaries, the taxpayers who support the payments to those plans, as well as donor to foundations and endowments that also invest in private equity even more than the widespread use of private jets, which is authorized not just for firm employees but at some general partners, even their family members. 
Another routine form of private equity rent extraction is how they get the fund investors, who are fiduciaries, to pay for lavish annual conferences which for the biggest funds includes big ticket entertainment like Elton John: #EltonJohn — TPG CEO Conference Phoenix AZ pic.twitter.com/gQWqkpPEwO 
— Doug Curling (@shakadoug) October 19, 2016 
And for the still skeptical, another source has confirmed that Elton John performed at the TPG conference. And as is typical in limited partnership agreements, investors are on the hook for the costs of “meetings” and this show, as part of a limited partner event, was on their nickel. 
The only TPG limited partnership agreement we have is for a credit fund, and debt investors (unless they obtain control of a company via Chapter 11 or an out of court restructuring) do not have direct control over portfolio companies. That makes it harder for them to keep various charges opaque to limited partners by laundering them through portfolio companies. Nevertheless, the TPG Opportunities Partners II (A) puts the cost of meetings squarely on the investors. From numbered page 42, section 6.01(b): 
Except as specifically set forth in Section 3.01 ofthe Management Agreement, the Partnership shall pay for (or shall reimburse the Management Company for its payment of) all fees, costs and expenses relating to the Partnership’s activities, operations, meetings (including Advisory Committee meetings)… 
And TPG’s current Form ADV is even clearer on this point : 
…each Fund also generally bears all of the expenses relating to its activities, operations, meetings and eventual liquidation (other than expenses resulting from the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of us or its general partner), 
And the ADV also specifies that TPG can charge entertainment to portfolio companies, which means limited partners have no idea how large the charges are in total: 
…reimbursements from portfolio companies for expenses (including travel expenses, which include expenses for business or first class travel, “black car” transportation and meals (including late night meals consumed at times when not traveling), entertainment-related expenses) we incur in connection with our performance of services for such portfolio company; 
Consider what this means. Private jet use supposedly OK not because it is an egregious perk for Masters of the Universe, but because their time is oh-so-valuable, and sometimes those mere commercial flights don’t get from Awkward Point A to Awkward Point B all that efficiently. The other justification is the need for secrecy and the ability to work on a private jet. The latter claim is pretty dodgy in light of the widespread industry practice of offering empty seats to supposed competitors if they happen to need a lift. So private jet use is an occasionally-justifible practice that has become a bad norm. 
By contrast, it’s hard to see lavish entertainment at supposed informational gatherings as anything other than a kickback to private equity investors. As someone who is in the business of consuming and analyzing information, it is vastly more efficient to process written information than speeches or presentations. Lambert and I both greatly prefer transcripts and can barely stand the time cost of listening to Web presentations. Conferences are an even bigger time sink. 
In other words, if the objective were to inform investors, these events are clearly not necessary. The limited partners are flattering themselves if they think they can learn anything more by seeing general partner execs or the team from their showcased portfolio companies in the flesh. These are all highly skilled performers and these events are very carefully staged in advance. 
So what are the limited partners getting? Aside from getting an excuse to visit New York, London, Phoenix, or other major destination, and getting wined and dined, the general partners are marketing to them. This is an extended sales pitch to help groom them to invest in the next fund. And secondarily, it’s an opportunity to mix socially with other limited partners…which is questionable as a use of the funds entrusted to them. They can do that just as well at educational conferences, which are also neutral territory. 
Indeed, a former private equity fund executive pointed out that keeping private equity staff at pension funds and foundations busy with the nominally important work of running around to general partner meet and greets seriously eroded the time they could spend doing what ought to be their real work, of reading the financial information and other reports provided by the general partners as well as their SEC Form ADVs, which it appears virtually no one in the industry bothers scrutinizing. 
One academic told me that he’d only encountered one investor who regularly read the IPOs of companies sold out of funds they’d invested in to see if there was anything they hadn’t anticipated so as to help them better evaluate future fund investments. Consistent with the thesis that general partner conferences were either by accident or design busywork to keep limited partners from digging into documents and data, this investor was in a remote part of Europe and didn’t often go to investor confabs because the travel time was apparently too costly relative to the information yield. 
One has to wonder how popular these general partner conferences would be if they instead featured rubber-chicken dinners and focused on information conveyance. The INET conferences, which by contrast are primarily networking events, featured long days (8 AM to 10 PM, with the lunch and dinner speakers covering substantive topics) for years until the participants cried uncle and asked for a less exhausting schedule. And these are people who don’t have billions of dollars of funds at risk. 
It’s not hard to imagine that if the general partners were dispensing information, as opposed to using investor monies to curry favor with them, you’d see them using tried and true forms, like public company quarterly earnings calls. But as people trained in making presentations know, conventions like a darkened room, the use of visuals on screens, having speakers on daises, all give the speakers a power advantage over the audience and deter questions. A conference call would be a dangerous leveler. Can’t have that, now can we? 
So expect this offensive form of grifting to continue. The old saying at CalPERS more than a decade ago was that the price of a $100 million commitment was a steak dinner. Imagine what seeing Elton John perform live buys. 0 0 0 0 0 2",1
20675,20675,"Leonard Litwin, New York Real Estate Mogul, Dies at 102 - The New York Times",Robert D. McFadden,"Leonard Litwin, a   developer who began with his father’s   plant nursery on Long Island, built a New York City residential real estate empire and paid millions to Republican and Democratic leaders to ensure tax breaks, government financing and favorable rent laws, died on Sunday at his home on Long Island, in Melville. He was 102. His death was confirmed by Charles C. Dorego, general counsel for the Litwin family and Mr. Litwin’s company, Glenwood Management Corporation. In the small circle of wealthy, sometimes flamboyant real estate moguls in New York, Mr. Litwin was almost invisible: a secretive man who kept his company private and his books closed lived quietly on Long Island, in Great Neck shunned publicity and said little about his assets and activities that was not good for business or required by law. But his imprint is on the Manhattan skyline in dozens of buildings he built, owned and operated  —   more than 8, 700 apartments with   amenities and lofty rents. The holdings were assembled over six decades in a    enterprise that ventured into the city rental market in the early 1950s and expanded into an archipelago of towers with names like the Pavilion, the Lucerne and Liberty Plaza. Behind the scenes, Mr. Litwin’s influence and that of Glenwood Management reached far beyond the buildings he owned. He forged political connections in Albany and City Hall with campaign contributions, lobbying and payments that shaped rent laws affecting millions of tenants, as well as state and city regulations that helped the real estate industry thrive in New York. In 2015, two extraordinary federal corruption trials in New York led to the convictions and resignations of the state’s two most powerful legislative leaders in Albany and exposed   bribery connections to Mr. Litwin’s empire, laying bare a seamy world of payoffs, political favors and legislation that reaped staggering profits and savings for the real estate industry, and for Glenwood Management in particular. Mr. Litwin was not charged with any crime, though he was named a   in one case, and never appeared in a courtroom for either trial as the juries convicted Assemblyman Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat and former Assembly speaker, and State Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican and Senate majority leader, of bribery, extortion and conspiracy charges. In both trials, prosecutors showed that Glenwood had received favored treatment in Albany by giving $10 million to political campaigns since 2005, mostly through a maze of 26 limited liability companies. Under a nonprosecution agreement, Mr. Dorego, a senior executive of Glenwood, testified that payoffs to leaders and members of the State Legislature assured Glenwood of continued benefits in taxes, state financing and rent laws. One program alone, he said, saved up to $100 million. In the Skelos case, the jury found that the senator and his son, Adam B. Skelos, had pressured Glenwood and two other companies into providing benefits worth $300, 000 to the son, who was also convicted. By naming Mr. Litwin a   of Dean Skelos, prosecutors were able to elicit testimony from Mr. Dorego about conversations he had with Mr. Litwin on the amounts and recipients of payments. By 2006, when Forbes listed him as a billionaire  —   No. 374 among the 400 richest Americans  —   Mr. Litwin was one of a core group of builders and property owners that dominated the city’s residential real estate industry. It was an exclusive club that included Stephen M. Ross of the Related Companies, the Elghanayan family, Donald Zucker, the Resnick family, the Rudin family and Larry A. Silverstein. Even to tenants who never knew his name and could never afford to live in one of his buildings, Mr. Litwin was an unseen power: a voice in the Rent Stabilization Association, the landlord organization that battles tenant groups annually over rent increases, set by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, that may legally be charged in hundreds of thousands of   apartments in the city. Mr. Litwin retired in his late 90s, although at 96 he was still actively involved in business. “He comes to the office every day, goes to all of our meetings and has the final say on almost everything,” Gary Jacob, the executive vice president of Glenwood, told The New York Times in 2011. “He’s actively involved in our new construction projects  —   he pores over the architectural plans to make sure we have the proper amount of closet space, and is very  . ” While Mr. Litwin carefully avoided publicity, he was in the news periodically for his political donations. Campaign finance records showed that over many years he gave millions to governors, state legislators, City Council members, candidates for office, and Republican and Democratic organizations. Public records also showed that he spent millions on lobbying. In July 2013, the New York Public Interest Research Group reported that Mr. Litwin had given Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo a total of $625, 000 in campaign contributions since December 2010, apparently making Mr. Litwin the governor’s largest donor. At the time, Mr. Cuomo was raising $1 million a month from contributors for his 2014   campaign. Mr. Litwin also gave large sums to former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat, and to many Republican officials, including former Gov. George E. Pataki and state legislators, particularly members of the Senate who favored real estate interests. Money trails in the 1990s showed that Mr. Litwin and other developers were heavy supporters of Republicans who pledged to abolish or limit tenant rent protections. Like other wealthy campaign donors, Mr. Litwin circumvented contribution limits by funneling many smaller gifts through dozens of limited liability companies he controlled. While legal, such gifts are worrying to advocates of campaign finance reforms, especially when the donations are made by individuals or companies doing business with the government. While politicians tend to minimize the impact of such donations, tenant advocates and others contend that the money is a prime mover in debates over rent laws and state and city regulations affecting the real estate industry. In any case, Mr. Litwin’s corporation benefited from special state financing, tax breaks, construction subsidies and other largess. In 2002, federal investigators said Mr. Litwin and dozens of other property owners had received illegal tax breaks arranged by a consultant who was charged with bribing tax assessors in a scheme that cost the city $160 million in revenue over four years. But the suspect, Albert Schussler, died of a stroke before he could testify, and Mr. Litwin and other owners denied knowledge of a crime and were not accused of wrongdoing. Starting in 1997, his company financed a series of buildings in New York using more than $1 billion in   bonds issued by the state, a form of taxpayer subsidy that reduces interest costs to a borrower. The buildings included Liberty Plaza, a   residential tower near the World Trade Center site. Liberty Plaza won approval for nearly $100 million in special state financing and a   real estate tax exemption, and was the first new apartment building erected in Lower Manhattan after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Leonard Litwin was born in New York City on Oct. 16, 1914, to Harold Litwin and the former Gertrude Meyer. The boy and his sister, Faye, grew up in Queens, attending public schools. Their father wrote two volumes of poetry under the name Harry Woodbourne. In 1933, Harold Litwin founded Woodbourne Cultural Nurseries in Melville, N. Y. with his son, who attended Columbia University briefly. The business, still in the family, did landscape work for builders. The father and son went into building themselves in 1946, erecting garden apartments on Long Island, followed by a   complex in Queens and a     in Riverdale, in the Bronx. After his father died in 1962, Mr. Litwin built numerous apartment towers on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, including one of the city’s largest, the Pavilion on East 77th Street near York Avenue. Over the next half century, Mr. Litwin built dozens of properties in Manhattan, almost exclusively rental towers with amenities like swimming pools, fitness centers and concierge services, charging rents of $7, 000 a month for some   layouts, and more than $30, 000 a month for penthouses. He rarely took on cooperative conversions and almost never a condominium project. Mr. Litwin, who also had homes in Great Neck, Manhattan and Boca Raton, Fla. is survived by two daughters, Carole Litwin Pittelman, now the president of Glenwood Management, and Diane Miller four grandchildren and six  . His wife, Ruth, died in 2014. Mr. Litwin and his wife gave millions to philanthropic causes, hospitals, and medical research on cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. He and Mr. Zucker founded a center on Long Island for the study of Alzheimer’s. The Litwin charitable investments were nearly all managed by Bernard L. Madoff and substantially lost in his Ponzi scheme, which swallowed up many fortunes before being exposed in 2008. Mr. Litwin was a longtime governor of the Real Estate Board of New York, the industry trade group, and in 2012 was named its lifetime honorary chairman. In 2009, he received the organization’s highest honor, the Harry B. Helmsley Distinguished New Yorker Award for lifetime achievement.",0

After Tuesday’s vote, hundreds of thousands of California schoolchildren may start attending classes primarily en español, thanks to a voter referendum that would repeal the requirement that schools teach primarily in English. 
California’s Proposition 58 would repeal Proposition 227 , a measure that easily passed nearly two decades ago, in 1998. Proposition 227 required all public schools in the state teach “overwhelmingly” in English, with limited-English proficiency (LEP) students transitioning to fully English classes as quickly as possible. 
{snip} 
Across the state, the English proficiency of LEP students tripled in just a few years , and math scores rose as well. 
But now, with California’s immigrant population higher than ever, the state is poised to reverse course. 
Polls indicate the Proposition 58 is likely to pass. Ironically, supporters of the measure place an emphasis on English rather than foreign tongues. They argue that the bill will allow for “dual immersion” programs, where both native English and native Spanish speakers can learn in a bilingual environment. In the long run, they argue, this will increase multilingualism and provide the state with a competitive advantage.

20677,20677,Europe Hopes for Clinton Win for More Deals With Iran,nan,"Europe Hopes for Clinton Win for More Deals With Iran November 01, 2016 Europe Hopes for Clinton Win for More Deals With Iran 
After a year of disappointment, European businesses are hoping a victory for Hillary Clinton in the U.S. election next week may help break the logjam that has prevented large-scale Western investments in Iran since the opening of its economy. While no one in Europe is predicting a flurry of new deals should Clinton defeat her Republican rival Donald Trump on Nov. 8 A win for the Democrat would remove some of the political clouds hanging over last year's nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Business groups say this could help fuel a more aggressive push into the Iranian market in 2017, especially in the second half of the year, if a Clinton victory is followed by the re-election of moderate Iranian President Hassan Rouhani next May. 
""If Clinton and Rouhani win, then we will have a political window of opportunity that is much bigger than we have now,"" said Matthieu Etourneau, who advises French firms on the Iranian market for MEDEF International, the French employers group. 
""This is what the European banks and companies are waiting for,"" he said. 
Back in January, when the United States and Europe lifted sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program, the excitement in Europe's business community was palpable. 
With a population of 78 million and annual output higher than that of Thailand, Iran was the biggest economy to rejoin the global trading and financial system since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. 
European politicians flocked to Tehran with dozens of corporate executives in tow. Rouhani, a pragmatist elected in 2013 on a platform to reduce Iran's isolation, traveled to Paris and Rome to promote his country to eager investors. 
But within months the euphoria had vanished, replaced by frustration on both sides. 
BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO IRAN DEAL: US LAWS 
The biggest obstacle for European firms seeking to do business in Iran has been the reluctance of the continent's largest banks to finance deals out of fear they could run afoul of U.S. sanctions and incur massive penalties down the line. 
The United States has taken steps to reassure the banks. Last month the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued new guidance to allay concerns about doing U.S. dollar transactions with Iran. 
READ MORE: DONALD TRUMP SAYS THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S FOREIGN POLICY WILL LEAD TO WORLD WAR THREE 
But Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged at a think-tank event in London this week that banks remained skittish. German officials raised their concerns about the hurdles during a recent visit by U.S. sanctions coordinator Daniel Fried. 
This caution is likely to persist, regardless of who is sitting in the White House. Beyond the issue of sanctions, the poor state of Iranian banks after a decade outside the international financial system, the strong state role in the economy and a lack of clarity about the legal system are all deterrents to foreigners. 
""Everyone knows now that this will be a long, step-by-step process to build up our economic ties,"" said Friedolin Strack, head of international markets at the Federation of German Industries (BDI). 
Still, a Clinton victory would be a reassuring signal to Europe. Her close adviser Jake Sullivan was a key figure in the secret negotiations in Oman that paved the way for the landmark agreement that curbed Iran's disputed nuclear activity, and she has defended it during the election campaign. 
Trump, by contrast, has called it ""one of the worst deals ever made"" and promised to renegotiate it if he is elected. Bankers say the risk of the deal unraveling under a Trump presidency has contributed to the reticence in Europe. 
Recently however, there have been signs of movement. 
Smaller German banks, pressed by their clients to support them in Iran, are beginning to offer limited financing and payment services. 
""Medium-sized banks that finance the German Mittelstand have a great deal of interest in Iran business and are preparing the groundwork intensively,"" said Siegfried Utzig, acting head of economic policy and international affairs at the Association of German Banks (BvB).

20678,20678,Former Attorney General Janet Reno Passes Away,Bob Adelmann,"Email 
As Janet Reno formally ended her public career following her failure to win a primary for governor of Florida in 2002, she quoted George Washington about her legacy: “If I were to write all that down I might be reduced to tears. I would prefer to drift on down the stream of life and let history make the judgment.” 
Her stream of life ended on Monday at age 78 when she passed away following complications from Parkinson’s disease. History will remember her for one thing: ordering the FBI to end the siege at Mount Carmel — the home of the Branch Davidians headed up by David Koresh — near Waco, Texas, by force, using tear gas and gunfire to end it, along with the lives of nearly 80 individuals including 25 children. 
Clinton nominated her for the position after two other women withdrew their acceptances, and she became attorney general in March, 1993. She was immediately thrust into the middle of the FBIs's siege against the Branch Davidian compound that began after ATF agents were involved in a shootout while trying to serve arrest warrants on Koresh and his followers for alleged firearms violaions. After 51 days, the FBI asked for permission to attack the compound and end the siege. Reno granted it, 76 people died, and the event has remained a black mark not only on her legacy but on the history of federal law enforcement ever since. 
Following the atrocity, Reno appointed former Senator John Danforth to look into charges that FBI agents started the fires, fired randomly into the building, and illegally used military forces to end the siege. When Danforth’s report exonerated the government and Reno, Koresh’s attorney called it a “whitewash” while former AG Ramsey Clark added, ""History will clearly record, I believe, that these assaults on the Mt. Carmel church center remain the greatest domestic law enforcement tragedy in the history of the United States."" 
For her part, and to her credit claim some of her supporters, Reno took full responsibility for allowing the FBI to end the siege with prejudice: “I made the decision. I’m accountable. The buck stops with me.” 
Over the following eight years, Reno was involved in other controversies: 
• Investigations into President Clinton’s sexual dalliances with his intern, Monice Lewinsky; 
• Her approval of the use of federal force to retrieve Elián Gonzalez, who was living with some relatives in Miami, and return him to his father in Castro’s Cuba, generating in the process a photograph of an armed federal agent seizing the six-year-old boy, providing millions with a visual warning of the dangers of the excessive use of force; 
• The capture and conviction of Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber; 
• The capture and conviction of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for their roles in the Oklahoma City bombing; 
• The capture and conviction of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and four other conspirators involved in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; and 
• Her roles in other controversies and scandals during the Clinton administration, including Whitewater, Filegate, the Chinese spying on American nuclear technology, the questionable campaign financing in the 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign, and her support for the 1994 Brady Bill which, for ten years, banned so-called assault rifles.

20679,20679,SNOWFLAKE: Colbert Didn’t Want To Write Jokes About Trump Winning | Daily Wire,nan,"SNOWFLAKE: Colbert Didn’t Want To Write Jokes About Trump Winning By: Hank Berrien November 21, 2016 
Conversing with fellow Daily Show “comic” John Oliver at the Montclair Film Festival on Saturday night, Late Show unfunny host Stephen Colbert admitted that he couldn’t even conceive that Donald trump would win the presidency; so much so that he couldn’t write jokes bout Trump winning for election night. 
In the roughly two-hour discussion and Q&A titled “Wow, That Was Weird,” Montclair Film Festival executive director Tom Hall set the somber tone by allowing, ""When we planned this evening, I think we all thought we'd be looking back with laughter instead of looking forward with deep concern about the uncertainty we face."" 
Speaking of the Late Show ’s Election Night special on Showtime, Colbert admitted that the staff was prepared for every result of the election except the one that actually transpired: 
There was not a bear big enough in the world that we weren't loaded for. We were so loaded for every possible eventuality. We had so many guests. We had so many pre-taped pieces, all based on a different eventuality. We had three shows: Hillary Clinton wins and we know; Hillary Clinton wins and we don’t know, because it’s not called before the show’s over; Donald Trump's going to win and we don’t know, because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory. That's not wishful thinking, that's what everyone was saying. 
And then there was the last show, which is the show we did, which is Donald Trump is going to win and we know he's going to win. My execs and my writers were like, “You don't want to write something for that?” and I'm like, “No! There is nothing you can write. You don't understand. I have 400 people in my theater. If we know Donald Trump is going to win, it's going to be like doing stand-up comedy for one of those Chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives. There will be no laughter!” We only did about 20 minutes of material before we went, “F— it, it's going to be him, let's just talk for another hour.” So I think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night. 
Colbert moaned that the special was ""the hardest thing I've ever done in my life,"" adding, ""I was tying my tie at 10:30 and I went, 'Oh, he took Ohio. Oh, well, we expected that. He took it by 11 points. Wow! That's not expected.' And then over my guests' shoulders, people kept holding up signs that said, 'Florida, Iowa, Nebraska.'"" He revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared, but ""none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned. Our audience was sobbing openly. And those are people who work for me, like my cameramen."" 
As Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro pointed out years ago , Colbert's manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives: 
He engages in Conservativeface. He needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative – after all, conservatives come in every shape and size. Instead, he acts as though he is a conservative – an idiotic, racist, sexist, bigoted, brutal conservative. He out-Archie Bunkers Archie Bunker. His audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious “Colbert” who wishes to persecute gays; they chortle at evil sexist “Colbert” who thinks men are victims of sexism. This is the purpose of Colbert’s routine. His show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks. In order to justify their racism, racists had to create a false perception of blacks; in the same way, Colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives. 
On Saturday night, Colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a Trump presidency, arguing, ""I’m all for giving him a chance, but don’t give him an inch. Because I believed everything he said, and I remember everything he said. And it’s horrifying. It's possible. The job changes a man. That's the cliche of the presidency."" He pontificated: 
Every president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say, “Well, there are levers of power in Washington that can slow him down.” But two things: One is they're cowards. Second is that the levers in Washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull. Because they tried to stop Trump. Everybody tried to stop Trump, do not delude yourself. 
Everyone except the people he's going to appoint tried to stop him and they didn't. He owes them nothing. He goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd, “Shall I do it?” And they say, '”Yes.” And he says, “It shall be so.” And the balcony is Twitter. He goes onto Twitter and he goes, “What do you think? Do you think I'm right?” That's what scares me, that he owes the checks and balances of Washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldn't. And he's a vindictive person. So it's all going to be fine. Merry Christmas. “No! There is nothing you can write."" Stephen Colbert 
Colbert concluded, ""The next person who says to me, 'You must be happy on a certain level,’ is going to have their eye carved out.” 
So that’s the man underneath the comedy mask . . .",1

Now, the smoking gun has emerged. 
Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton insider and former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman, steered at least $675,000 to the election of the wife of an FBI official involved in the Clinton probe. McAuliffe’s political action committee gave $467,500 to the state senate campaign for FBI agent Andrew McCabe’s wife. He is now the deputy director of the FBI. 
More money came to her through the Democratic Party of Virginia : 
Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, the report states, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe. 
The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate’s husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the FBI. 
Within a year, McCabe was promoted to deputy director, the second-highest position in the bureau.[…] 
The governor’s office claimed the FBI’s McCabe met the governor only once — on March 7, 2015, when McAuliffe persuaded Jill McCabe to run. 
The 2015 Virginia state Senate run — her first run for public office — was unsuccessful as she lost to the incumbent Republican. 
McAuliffe “supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors… Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would",1

20682,20682,Right-Wing Militiamen Aquitted In Armed Takeover Of Malheur Refuge,teleSUR,"Videos Right-Wing Militiamen Aquitted In Armed Takeover Of Malheur Refuge The standoff at a wildlife refuge in Oregon was never branded ""domestic terrorism"" by authorities or the media. | October 28, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! Ammon Bundy, center, one of the sons of Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, walks off after speaking with reporters during a news conference at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters Monday, Jan. 4, 2016, near Burns, Ore. Bundy, who was involved in a 2014 standoff with the government over grazing rights told reporters on Monday that two local ranchers who face long prison sentences for setting fire to land have been treated unfairly. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) All seven far-right militiamen who led an armed takeover of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon in January that led to a standoff with police were found not guilty of all charges stemming from the action. 
The seven anti-government men, including brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, began their 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge on Jan. 2 with at least a dozen armed men, in the latest flare-up in a nearly century-old conflict over federal control of millions of acres of public land in the West. 
They surrendered when a spokesman for the group, Robert “La Voy” Finnicum was shot and killed by state police. 
Charges included conspiracy to threaten, force and intimidate park officials trying to end the standoff, theft of public property and the use and carrying of a firearm. 
teleSUR journalist Arun Gupta, who reported from the scene during the occupation, said that charging the militia group with conspiracy instead of what by definition is “domestic terrorism,” is an example of the “hypocrisy and double standards of the U.S. government.” 
Deliberations continued until Thursday morning after a juror was dismissed over accusations of bias — the juror, a former employee of the Bureau of Land Management, had allegedly told others he is “very biased.” The federal judge told the 12-person jury to “disregard entirely” previous discussions and start anew. 
Accusing the federal government of stealing land in Oregon, the group has refused to pay for cattle-grazing permits. They were demanding that the federal government hand over the rights to the refuge to individual states and residents for their own use. 
Both Bundy brothers had been in jail since being arrested after the standoff ended. A separate trial will take place in February 2017 for a second group of defendants charged in relation to the standoff.",1
20683,20683,WATCH: Vandals Twist Arizona Jewish Family’s Menorah Into Swastika - Breitbart,Deborah Danan,"TEL AVIV  —   A Jewish family from Arizona woke up this weekend to find their Hanukkah menorah had been twisted by vandals into the shape of a swastika. [Seeing their neighbors Christmas decorations, Naomi and Seth Ellis’s three children insisted on decorating their home for the Jewish festival, the Washington Post reported. Their parents obliged by erecting an oversize   menorah outside of their home, made of   PVC pipe and using solar powered lights.   “Just waking up to see that first thing is kind of rattling,” Seth Ellis told ABC15. “It just makes me sad and it makes me feel sick that’s still how people look at the world in 2016,” he added. The children did not see what the vandals had done to the menorah but Naomi Ellis said that explaining to her boys, aged five, seven, and nine, what had occurred was difficult. “I’m still not sure how I will explain this to [my children],” she wrote on Facebook. “I’m not sure I quite understand it myself.   …     How can people be filled with so much hate and violence? To think that someone would make such an effort to hurt and vandalize a family is downright sickening. ” “We live in a great neighborhood with kind and welcoming neighbors. We never would have imagined that someone would spread so much hate here,” she said. “We talk a lot about the importance of equality and tolerance, loving everybody no matter what,” she told the Washington Post after speaking with her children. “I had to tell them that not everybody feels that way. Some people are ignorant, and this is what they do. ” “This is the real reality that we live in: People hate us for no reason or want us to feel scared for who we are. That’s not something I wanted to have to tell them,” Naomi told the Post. Seth and Naomi Ellis spent Friday afternoon putting the menorah back together again. “You have to put it back up,” Seth Ellis told ABC15 reporter Megan Thompson. “I mean, what kind of statement is it for me not to put it back up, especially for my kids?” When asked what he would do if the new menorah was also vandalized, Seth answered he would go about rebuilding it again: “As many times as I have to. ” The Ellis family invited their community to attend a Hanukkah lighting ceremony of the new menorah at their home. No arrests have been made.",0
20684,20684,Donald Trump Apology Caps Day of Outrage Over Lewd Tape - The New York Times,"Alexander Burns, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin","Donald J. Trump issued an unusual videotaped apology early Saturday after a 2005 recording surfaced that showed him speaking in extraordinarily vulgar terms about women, setting off an uproar in the Republican Party. “Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am,” he said. “I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize. ” The apology came as the presidential nominee faced extraordinary censure from Republican leaders after the tape was made public. The recording captures Mr. Trump speaking about pushing himself on women and boasting that he could get away with “anything” because of his celebrity. In the   recording, which was obtained by The Washington Post, Mr. Trump recounts to the television personality Billy Bush of “Access Hollywood” how he once pursued a married woman and “moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there,” expressing regret that they did not have sex. But he brags of a special status with women: Because he was “a star,” he says, he could “grab them by the pussy” whenever he wanted. “You can do anything,” Mr. Trump says. He also said he was compulsively drawn to kissing beautiful women “like a magnet”  —   “I don’t even wait”  —   and talked about plotting to seduce the married woman by taking her furniture shopping. Mr. Trump, who was 59 at the time he made the remarks, went on to disparage the woman, whom he did not name, saying, “I did try and fuck her. She was married,” and saying, “She’s now got the big phony tits and everything. ” On Friday night, Speaker Paul D. Ryan withdrew an invitation for Mr. Trump to appear alongside him in Wisconsin this weekend. Mr. Ryan described himself in a statement as “sickened” by Mr. Trump’s remarks. Hours before his video apology, Mr. Trump released a statement on Friday afternoon expressing regret “if anyone was offended” by his comments, but he tried to play down the tape as a snippet of “locker room banter. ” His running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, brushed off the banter at a rally in Rossford, Ohio. “They’ll say, this time we got him,” Mr. Pence said. “This time we got another thing, another issue that’s come forward. Then they turn on the next television the next morning, and Donald Trump is still standing stronger than ever before and fighting for the American people. ” But Mr. Pence also telephoned Mr. Trump on Friday night and urged him to show humility, according to an adviser to the nominee who requested anonymity to reveal a private conversation. (Mr. Trump had already decided to apologize when Mr. Pence called, the adviser noted.) Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, issued a statement late Friday night calling on Mr. Trump to express contrition  —   and possibly offering other Senate Republicans cover to disavow the nominee if he refused to apologize. “As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape,” Mr. McConnell said. While neither Mr. Ryan nor Mr. McConnell immediately withdrew formal support for Mr. Trump, Republican leaders in Washington held anguished discussions throughout the evening about how the party should proceed with a badly wounded and potentially toxic nominee. They cannot remove their nominee from the ticket, but some Republican lawmakers called on Mr. Trump to step down voluntarily, including Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, who previously said he would not support Mr. Trump, and Representatives Mike Coffman of Colorado and Barbara Comstock of Virginia. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who also has not endorsed Mr. Trump, recorded a live video on Facebook in which he asked the candidate, “with all due respect, to step aside. ” Mr. Trump, seeking to minimize the import of the disclosure despite the public rebuke by Mr. Ryan, announced late Friday evening that he would no longer travel to Wisconsin as planned and would send Mr. Pence in his stead. Mr. Trump said he would spend Saturday preparing for his second debate with Hillary Clinton, set to take place Sunday in St. Louis. Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly attacked and mocked Mrs. Clinton’s marriage in recent weeks, also sought to implicate Bill Clinton in his coarse conduct. “Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course  —   not even close,” Mr. Trump said in a statement. “I apologize if anyone was offended. ” And in his video apology later, he said: “I’ve said some foolish things. But there’s a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. ” Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to attack Mrs. Clinton over her husband’s affairs and how she responded to them. The disclosure of the recording comes at the end of a punishing two weeks, during which Mr. Trump has faced intense backlash over his treatment of women and intensifying scrutiny of his personal finances and views on national security. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign condemned Mr. Trump forcefully for the comments captured on the recording. Her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, said in response to the remarks, “It makes me sick to my stomach. ” More Republicans joined in the denunciation, including Gov. Gary Herbert and Representative Jason Chaffetz, both of Utah, who had said this summer that they would vote for Mr. Trump, and on Friday retracted their support. “Donald Trump’s statements are beyond offensive  despicable,” Mr. Herbert wrote on Twitter. “While I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, I will not vote for Trump. ” Mr. Trump had already been on the defensive on Friday after telling CNN that he still believed the exonerated defendants known as the Central Park Five were guilty of a 1989 rape of a female jogger despite DNA evidence to the contrary that later overturned their convictions. Earlier in the day, he also asserted, again without evidence, that the Obama administration was allowing illegal immigrants to enter the country in order to vote in November. Also in the last week, The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump had declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns, a tax deduction so substantial it could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years. For Republicans on the ballot this fall, the uproar over Mr. Trump’s past statements about women touched off an agonizing political cycle, marked by partial denunciations of Mr. Trump  —   and demands from Democrats that their denunciations go further. Republican candidates for the House and Senate, and for governorships across the country, chastised Mr. Trump sternly but stopped short of renouncing him as their choice for the presidency. One Republican senator seeking   Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was criticized this week when she called Mr. Trump a role model for children, said his comments were “totally inappropriate and offensive. ” Ms. Ayotte, one of the most prominent women in the party, was facing immense pressure Friday night from other Republicans to disavow Mr. Trump entirely, and was said to be considering it. In an illustration of the Democratic onslaught, her opponent, Gov. Maggie Hassan, called Mr. Trump’s comments inexcusable. “It is beyond comprehension how Senator Ayotte could continue to support this man for the highest office in the land, let alone call him a role model,” Ms. Hassan said. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has endorsed Mr. Trump, said, “There are no excuses for Donald Trump’s offensive and demeaning comments. ” He was clearly worried about how they might affect his own   campaign, adding, “He alone bears the burden of his conduct and alone should suffer the consequences. ” Another Republican to turn his back on Mr. Trump on Friday was Jon M. Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, who just a week ago said he planned to vote for Mr. Trump. He told The Salt Lake Tribune that the nominee should withdraw from the race. “In a campaign cycle that has been nothing but a race to the bottom  —   at such a critical moment for our nation  —   and with so many who have tried to be respectful of a record primary vote, the time has come for Governor Pence to lead the ticket,” Mr. Huntsman told the newspaper. Mr. Trump’s behavior has at times startled and unnerved women in his life, from employees at his company to the contestants in his beauty pageants, The Times found after interviewing dozens of them for an article in May. They described unwanted romantic advances and unending commentary on the female form. Temple Taggart, Miss Utah in 1997, was uncomfortable with how forward Mr. Trump was with young contestants like her in his first year as the owner of Miss USA, a branch of the beauty pageant organization. As she recalls it, he introduced himself in an unusually intimate manner. “He kissed me directly on the lips. I thought, ‘Oh, my God. Gross.’ He was married to Marla Maples at the time,” she said. “I think there were a few other girls that he kissed on the mouth. I was like, “Wow, that’s inappropriate. ” Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, suggested Mr. Trump had discussed committing a violent crime in his 2005 conversation with Mr. Bush. “What Trump described in these tapes amounts to sexual assault,” said Ms. Laguens. “Trump’s behavior is disgusting and unacceptable in any context, and it is disqualifying for a man who is running for president of this country. ” The recording of Mr. Trump talking to Mr. Bush was made as they sat on a bus on the set of a soap opera where Mr. Trump was making a cameo appearance. The conversation was recorded after he had married Melania Trump, his third and current wife. At one point, the conversation in the video was interrupted when an actress arrived to take Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush to the set. Mr. Trump seemed excited. “You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful  —   I just start kissing them,” Mr. Trump says. “It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. ” Ms. Trump was pregnant at the time that Mr. Trump’s remarks were recorded in   2005 their son, Barron, was born the next March.",0

J.  —   Mohammad Ali Chaudry, a retired financial officer, has lived in this prosperous town for 40 years. It is where he raised his three children and where he served as mayor, and before that, as a member of the school board. It was also where Mr. Chaudry, an observant Muslim, always wanted to pray. But Mr. Chaudry and some 70 fellow Muslims have been stymied for years in their quest to build a mosque on a   plot of land in Basking Ridge, a genteel community here that is as proud of its old oak trees as its old homes. A year ago, after 39 public hearings in which local officials and residents picked apart every aspect of the proposed mosque, the planning board rejected the proposal, citing issues like storm water management and pedestrian safety in the parking lot. Now, the federal Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Bernards Township, arguing that its decision violated federal law and discriminated against the applicants purely because of their Muslim faith. The complaint, filed last month, follows a lawsuit brought by Mr. Chaudry’s Islamic Society of Basking Ridge, which has been subjected to   fliers and social media posts and even vandalism. During the protracted application process, someone stomped on the group’s mailbox and later superimposed “ISIS” over the society’s initials on the mailbox. “This was unprecedented,” said Mr. Chaudry, the society’s president, who holds a Ph. D. in economics from Tufts University and teaches a course at Rutgers University on Islam. “No other house of worship in the township’s history had ever been treated the way we were. ” Across the country, more and more towns have used local zoning laws as barriers to new mosques and Islamic schools, underscoring what civil rights advocates say is a growing wave of intolerance that has been amplified by the victory of   Donald J. Trump. In response, the federal government has been increasingly turning to the courts, using a law passed unanimously by Congress in 2000 that prohibits municipalities from discriminating against religions in   decisions or treating religious groups differently than secular ones. While the law, with the arcane name Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, was intended to protect all religious faiths, 11 of the last 13 cases brought by the Justice Department  —   including three in the last month  —   have involved Muslims. “The law, by its very nature, deals with particularly vulnerable populations,” said Mark Goldfeder, a senior lecturer at Emory University’s School of Law and a senior fellow at the university’s Center for the Study of Law and Religion. “It’s so easy for towns to hide discrimination behind layers of   procedure. ” But Muslim advocates and experts on religious freedom worry that Mr. Trump’s impending inauguration leaves the future of the powerful religious freedom law in doubt. The man the   has nominated to lead the Justice Department, Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, has endorsed Mr. Trump’s call for a temporary ban on immigration from Muslim countries. As the nation’s chief law enforcement officer, Mr. Sessions might be less sympathetic to pursuing investigations involving the rights of Muslims. There are now 13 open   investigations under the law, though a spokesman for the department declined to say how many of those involved mosques. Ross K. Baker, a distinguished professor of political science at Rutgers who has studied the federal law, said it was “entirely possible” Mr. Sessions could choose to dial back on the investigations. “It is within the province of the attorney   to decide whether to proceed with a lawsuit,” he said. Another recent case brought by the department involved a proposed mosque in Virginia. The lawsuit argued that Culpeper County violated the religious   law in denying a sewage permit application. The complaint noted that since 1992, the county had considered 26 applications and never before denied such a permit to either a commercial or religious group. In a speech this month at a Virginia mosque, Loretta E. Lynch, United States the attorney general, talked about the department’s response to a surge in hate crimes, highlighting enforcement of the   law. “Members of the Civil Rights Division have heard repeatedly about more overt discrimination in both the tone and framing of objections to planned religious institutions, especially mosques and Islamic centers,” said Ms. Lynch, who sent a letter to state and local officials on Thursday reminding them of the law and their obligation to respect religious freedom. In the case of Bernards Township, the Islamic Society bought land that was in a zone that permitted a house of worship. Raising money from various sources, Mr. Chaudry oversaw the purchase of four acres, aware that the zoning code required at least three acres for a house of worship. The society hired an architect who took pains to design a mosque that would blend in with the neighborhood, where a fire station stands across the street from the site. The    mosque, the size of a large house, would forgo the traditional dome and would include minarets that mimic the chimneys on neighboring houses. “The mosque proposal met with vociferous public opposition,” the Justice Department wrote in its recent complaint. “Fliers, social media and websites denounced the mosque and were filled with   bigotry and references to terrorism and the   attacks. ” The federal lawsuit concluded that the planning board had used different requirements in denying the society’s application than it “had in evaluating previous applications. ” The language in the society’s own lawsuit was more blunt: “What should have been a simple board approval for a permitted use devolved into a Kafkaesque process that spanned an unprecedented four years. ” Nearly three dozen religious, legal and civil rights groups have supported the society’s lawsuit by signing amicus briefs, said the society’s lawyer, Adeel A. Mangi, of the firm Patterson Belknap Webb  Tyler. Bernards Township officials deny that the applicants’ faith played any role in their decision. The mayor, Carol Bianchi, declined to respond to the allegations. But a statement by the township after the Justice Department filed its lawsuit asserted that the planning board’s denial was based on “legitimate   and safety concerns which plaintiffs refused, and to this day, refuse to address. ” The township’s most forceful response was reserved for the Justice Department, which it accused of a conflict of interest because one of its investigators served on the same board at Drew University’s Center for Religious and Cultural Conflicts as Mr. Chaudry. The township also claimed that the department’s communication with the Islamic Society before bringing the federal complaint suggested an “inappropriate collusion. ” The United States attorney for New Jersey, Paul J. Fishman, a Democrat, looked into the township’s allegations and declared them baseless. In July, the Justice Department released a report on its enforcement of the federal law since 2010, which detailed the growing proportion of cases involving mosques. It also found that while 84 percent of   investigations were resolved without a lawsuit, only a fifth of cases involving Islamic institutions were similarly resolved. In Bernards Township, much of the initial resistance to the proposed mosque centered on parking. According to the federal complaint, the local ordinance required 50 parking spaces for houses of worship based on a    standard ratio, or an average of three people arriving in one car. But a traffic engineer enlisted by opponents of the mosque recommended 107 spaces. The planning board insisted the mosque meet that goal, which, in turn, raised new issues, like visual impacts and storm water runoff. The society’s complaint stated that applicants “dutifully revised their site plan and brought back professionals to testify time and again, only to find that the board had generated yet more requirements. ” Mr. Fishman said the township “kept moving the goal posts. ” For Mr. Chaudry and other members of the society, the lack of a mosque has made worshiping difficult. The nearest mosque is 25 minutes away. Members have rented a local community center for Friday prayers, lugging in prayer rugs and audio equipment. But the center is unavailable in the summer so they pray in a public park. And the absence of a mosque has prevented the society from attracting a   imam. During public hearings, some residents made   remarks, but town officials mostly restricted their comments to   questions. But in a trove of emails unearthed by the Justice Department investigation, and recently shown to the Islamic Society, the same officials shared their personal views of Muslims. In one email, a member of the township committee, John Malay, wrote, “As a religion, Islam owes its source of influence to a tradition from Day 1 of forced conversion through violent means. ” In an email chain, members of the committee and planning board discussed ways to exclude Mr. Chaudry from a Sept. 11 memorial ceremony in honor of town residents who died in the terrorist attack. “Let’s make it happen without that fool,” John Carpenter, a township committee member, said. Mr. Chaudry is active in local groups like the Rotary Club and statewide committees promoting interfaith understanding. In 2013, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, appointed him to the New Jersey Commission on National and Community Service. He also serves on the state attorney general’s Outreach Committee for the Muslim Community and the Interfaith Advisory Council of the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness. Outside the Dutch colonial on Church Street that serves as the society’s offices and where, members hope, a new mosque will one day stand, signs of patriotism abound. A sign amid American flags of various sizes proclaims, “Proud to Be an American. ” “We feel everybody should know that we are American,” Mr. Chaudry said.",0
20687,20687,The Pathologization of Dissent,C.J. Hopkins,"Joseph Sohm / Shutterstock.com 
According to the mainstream media, in a recent speech in West Palm Beach, Donald Trump finally completely lost it. Sawing the air with his tiny hands in a unmistakeably Hitlerian manner, he spat out a series of undeniably hateful anti-Semitic code words … like “political establishment,” “global elites” and, yes, “international banks.” He even went so far as to claim that “corporations” and their (ahem) “lobbyists” have millions of dollars at stake in this election, and are trying to pass the TTP, not to benefit the American people, but simply to enrich themselves. He then went on to accuse the media of collaborating with “the Clinton machine,” presumably to benefit these “global elites” and “international banks” and “lobbyists.” 
Now, a lot of folks didn’t immediately recognize the secret meanings of these fascistic code words, and so mistakenly assumed that “global elites” referred to the transnational capitalist ruling classes, and that “lobbyists” referred to actual lobbyists, and that “banks” meant … well … you know, banks. As it turned out, this was completely wrong. None of these words actually meant what they meant, not in anti-Semitic CodeSpeak. So the mainstream media translated for us. “Political establishment” meant “the Jews.” “Global elites” also meant “the Jews.” “Banks” meant “Jews.” “Lobbyists” meant “Jews.” Even “corporate media,” meant “Jews.” Apparently, Trump’s entire speech was a series of secret dog-whistle signals to his legions of neo-Nazi goons, who, immediately following Clinton’s victory, are going to storm out of their hidey holes, frontally attack the US military, overthrow the US government, and, yes, you guessed it … “kill the Jews.” 
OK, maybe I’m exaggerating the mainstream media’s reaction just a little bit. Or maybe Trump’s speech really was that fascistic. Judge for yourself. Read the transcript. ( NPR offers a complete version of it here. ) Then compare the reactions of The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times , Washington Post , The Inquirer , The Guardian , and other leading broadsheets, and magazines and blogs like Mother Jones , Forward , Slate , Salon , Vox , Alternet , and a host of others, most of which rely on Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League and former Special Assistant to the President, as their authoritative source on Trumpian cryptology. (Mr. Greenblatt, incidentally, should know better, given the treatment he has received from hard-line Zionist publications for refusing to demonize Black Lives Matter, and for “taking sides against” the State of Israel.) 
Look, I’m not defending Donald Trump, who I consider a self-aggrandizing idiot and a soulless huckster of the lowest order, and whose supporters include a lot of real anti-Semites, and racists, and misogynists, and other such creeps. I’m simply trying to point out how the corporate media have, for months, been playing the same hysterical tune like an enormous Goebbelsian keyboard instrument, and how millions of Americans are singing along (as they were before the invasion of Iraq, which posed no threat to the USA , but which according to the media had WMDs), and how terribly fucking disturbing that is. In case you didn’t instantly recognize it, the name of the tune is “This guy is Hitler!” and it isn’t the short vulgarian fingers of Donald Trump that are tickling the ivories. And no, it isn’t “the Jews” either. It’s the corporate media, and the corporations that own them, and the rest of the global capitalist ruling classes … in other words, those “global elites.” 
The thing I find particularly disturbing is how these rather mundane observations — i.e., (a) that a global ruling class exists, (b) that it’s primarily corporate in character, (c) that this class is pursuing its interests and not the interests of sovereign states — how such observations are being stigmatized as the ravings of unhinged anti-Semites. This stigmatization is not limited to Trumpists. Anyone to the left of Clinton is now, apparently, an anti-Semite. For example, Roger Cohen, in The New York Times , riding the tsunami of condemnation of the insidious verbiage of Trump’s West Palm speech, executed an extended smear-job on Jeremy Corbyn and his “Corbynistas” (they’re fond of coining these epithets, the media), denouncing their virulent “anti-Americanism,” “anti-Capitalism,” “anti-globalism,” and “anti-Semitic anti-Zionism.” 
Which, let me hasten to add, and stress, and underscore, and repeatedly emphasize, is not to imply that the Labour Party, or the British Left, or the American Left, or any other Left, is anti-Semitism-free. Of course not. There are anti-Semites everywhere. That isn’t the point. Or it isn’t my point. 
My point is that this stigmatization campaign is part of a much larger ideological project, one that has little to do with Trump, or Jeremy Corbyn, or their respective parties. Smearing one’s political opponents is nothing new, of course, it’s as old as the hills. But what we’re witnessing is more than smears. As I proposed in these pages back in July , political dissent is being gradually pathologized (i.e., stigmatized as aberrant or “abnormal” behavior, as opposed to a position meriting discussion). Consider the abnormalization of Sanders, back when he was talking about “banks,” “global elites,” and other things that matter, or the media’s portrayal of British voters as racists in the wake of the Brexit referendum. And, yes, the charges being leveled against Trump, much as we might despise the man. Anti-Semitism, inciting violence, paranoid conspiracy theorizing, insurrection, treason, et cetera — these are not legitimate arguments one needs to counter with superior arguments; they are symptoms of deviations from a norm, signs of criminality or pathology, which is increasingly how the corporate ruling classes are dismissing anyone who attempts to challenge them. 
A line is being drawn in the ideological sand. On one side of it are the decent people, the normal people, in their business wear, with their university degrees, and prescriptions, and debts. On the other side are … well, the deplorables, the ignorant, racist, anti-Semitic, neo-nationalist, populist extremists. This line cuts through both the Left and the Right … supersedes both Left and Right, making bedfellows of supposed adversaries like Obama, Clinton, Kagan, Wolfowitz, Scowcroft, and their ilk on the Normal team, and a motley crew of Trumpists, Putinists, European populists, Corbynistas, Sandernistas, socialists, anarchists, Wikileakers, anti-Zionists, anti-capitalists, neo-Nazis, Black Lives Matterers, angry Greek pensioners, environmental activists, religious zealots, the Klu Klux Klan, David Graeber, most of the contributors to CounterPunch, and various other “extremist” types, many of whom detest each other, in the Deplorables’ current starting line-up. 
The corporate media is sending a message … a message aimed at a much broader audience than undecided American voters (assuming such creatures really exist). The message is, “get with the fucking program, or get stigmatized as an anti-Semite, or a racist, or a Russian spy, or whatever.” The message is, “drop the populist rhetoric, shut the hell up about the Wall Street banks, and the corporations, and the ‘one percent,’ and … actually … forget about politics completely, except for identity politics, of course. Go ahead and knock yourself out with that.” The message is, “you’re either with us or against us … and it doesn’t matter why you’re against us, or what it is you think you’re for. Right, Left … who gives a shit? It’s one big Basket of Deplorables to us.” 
This message, of course, displays many of the hallmarks of the classic authoritarian mentality, the need for nearly total conformity, mindless allegiance to one’s so-called superiors, delegitimization of all opposing viewpoints, and the infantile type of hero-worship figures like Obama and Clinton inspire … not the old-fashioned authoritarianism that would-be despots like Trump represent, but, rather, a more attractive version, a hopey, changey, lovey version, where there are no frightening Hitlerian leaders barking out anti-Semitic code words, and no one is exterminating thousands of people in faraway countries they want to destabilize in order to entirely dominate the region. No, this is the version where Obama sells the TPP on the Jimmy Fallon show, and wars of aggression are not wars of aggression, but “humanitarian interventions.” It’s also the version where universal healthcare is, regrettably, “unrealistic,” but $38 billion for the State of Israel so it can operate its Apartheid State, and weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, so they can bomb the shit out of farmers in Yemen, and cut off people’s heads for blasphemy, is somehow in “America’s vital interests.” 
But what do I know? I’m just a satirist. I should probably leave all this complex stuff, like what is and isn’t in my interest, and what words really mean and all that, to the experts in the mainstream media. Since they did so well decoding Trump’s speech, maybe they could translate some of these other code words I’ve been having trouble with, like the ones I put in scare quotes above, or other such code words, like “enemy combatant,” “free trade agreement,” “security barrier,” “indefinite detention,” “targeted killing,” or “troubled asset relief program.” 
I could go on, but I probably shouldn’t. Odds are, I’m already on the list of Putin-worshiping, anti-Semitic, racist, misogynist, neo-nationalist, non-standing up for the National Anthem, conspiracy theorizing America-haters. The last thing I need to do at this point is start jabbering about how the United States is an authoritarian corporatist dystopia ruled by a global capitalist elite that couldn’t give less of a shit about Americans (or any other actual people living in any other actual countries), where the corporate media can whip up mass fanatical support for wars of aggression, or corporate puppets, by pointing their fingers at yet another bogeyman and shouting “Hitler” at the top of their lungs. Next thing you know I’d be writing about “banks,” and “global corporations,” and “national sovereignty,” and we all know what that’s about, don’t we?

20688,20688,A Push to Lower Drug Prices That Hit Insurers and Employers the Hardest - The New York Times,Katie Thomas,"Americans have expressed outrage at drug companies for raising prices on products like EpiPen, the severe allergy treatment needed by thousands of children, and Daraprim, a rarely used but essential drug to treat a parasitic infection. But insurers and employers  —   who pay the bulk of the cost for drugs  —   say that a bigger financial shock has come from a largely overlooked source: expensive   medications like Humira and Enbrel, drugs taken by millions of people for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. In recent years, the prices of the medications have doubled, making them the costliest drug class in the country by some calculations. Now, one of the most powerful forces on the side of drug payers is pushing back. On Thursday, Express Scripts, the nation’s largest drug benefits manager, changed its recommendations to insurers and employers, saying they should cover fewer drugs for many inflammatory conditions. The idea is that the new limits will force drug companies to lower their prices, saving insurers and employers money. The approach has already set off some complaints among patients, who rely on regular injections of the drugs to keep painful and uncomfortable symptoms in check. If an approved drug does not work, patients will have to take extra steps to get a different drug. But Express Scripts said that the move was necessary to contain costs. The drugs account for nearly 10 percent of all drug spending among its members in the United States, the company says  —   costing an estimated $7. 5 billion  —   even though fewer than 1 percent of its members use them. “This is a category of drugs that are used for crippling, very painful conditions, yet they don’t affect huge numbers of people,” said Dr. Glen Stettin, the chief innovation officer at Express Scripts. The rising costs, he said, are due less to a rising number of patients who need the products and “much more because of the increase in the prices of these medications. ” The approach is the latest effort by insurers and drug benefit managers to more closely manage drugs in   diseases, limiting which ones are covered or requiring patients to take additional steps to get approval for certain products. In 2014, Express Scripts shook up the market for hepatitis C drugs when it required its patients to use a new treatment by AbbVie rather than more expensive competitors. It made similar moves last year with the approval of expensive new treatments for high cholesterol. Like those previous efforts, the effort for inflammatory conditions will most likely help the company’s   specialty pharmacy, Accredo. Express Scripts said patients getting the   medications through the new program would need to use Accredo, not a competing pharmacy, giving the service a bigger base of customers. As a drug benefit manager, Express Scripts provides services like negotiating with drug companies and approving or denying drug claims. The new program is voluntary for employers and insurers who use the company, but its recommendations are usually widely adopted. Humira, made by AbbVie, and Enbrel, made by Amgen, each carry a monthly list price of just over $4, 000, and each have increased those prices by about 130 percent from 2011 to 2016, according to the Gold Standard Drug Database compiled by Elsevier Clinical Solutions. That price does not include rebates that the manufacturers negotiate with insurers. Express Scripts said that the actual monthly cost of   drugs, before the new program, was about $3, 000. Representatives for large employers, who subsidize the health insurance of their employees, said the efforts were welcome. Drugs like Humira and Enbrel are known as specialty drugs, a category of products that treat serious conditions and whose rising costs have increasingly alarmed those who are paying the bills. “If you go back to 2014, it wasn’t even on the radar screen for employers, and now it’s No. 1,” said Brian J. Marcotte, the chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which advocates for large employers. But some patients questioned whether it would further limit the options for some people or make it more cumbersome to get the medications they needed. The program would apply only to new patients those already stable on drugs would be allowed to remain on them. “Jumping through hoops may not seem like a big thing to somebody that doesn’t have to live with the condition,” said Nicole Martin, 33, of Blaine, Ky. who has rheumatoid arthritis and takes Enbrel. “But even being a day or two behind can cause massive issues for somebody. ” Traditionally, patients were offered all the drugs that were covered by their plans no matter which inflammatory condition they had  —   from rheumatoid arthritis to psoriasis and ulcerative colitis. Under the new guidelines, Express Scripts has devised a separate list of preferred and nonpreferred drugs for each condition. Patients who want to use a drug on the nonpreferred list will need a letter from their doctor. The company said the move would require drug companies to compete more directly. The motivation to get on the preapproved list, the company said, would push drug companies to offer better discounts to employers and insurers. Express Scripts declined to provide specifics about the discounts that it had negotiated through the new program. “We expect to make a big dent in the cost of caring for people in this category, without compromising the care that people get,” Dr. Stettin said. Dr. Stettin said the company looked at patient data first when deciding which drugs would be preferred. “Clinical always comes first, and the cost is second,” he said. Representatives for drug companies, including AbbVie and Amgen, said they believed doctors and patients  —   and not insurance companies  —   should decide which therapy is best. And they said the list price does not reflect the rebates and other discounts that insurance companies and   managers negotiate, which make the actual cost lower. “Because of the magnitude of these rebates,” said Kristen Davis, a spokeswoman for Amgen, “price increases have become part of the competitive dynamic. ” The program will also refund up to $2, 000 a month to employers and insurers if a patient has to switch from a preferred drug to a different medication in the first three months, a potential savings of about $250 million a year. About a quarter to a third of patients end up switching to a new drug in the first few months, Express Scripts said. But that   guarantee does not necessarily go to the patient, even if the patient has a   plan and paid for all or most of the drug. Employers will decide whether to pass that refund along to the patients, Express Scripts said. A reason that the rising cost of drugs like Humira and Enbrel hasn’t stoked greater outrage is that many patients are shielded from the costs. In addition to the discounts the companies negotiate with drug benefit managers, AbbVie and Amgen run assistance programs that often reduce patients’    costs. The average Express Scripts member paid $127 in monthly   for a drug to treat an inflammatory condition, the company said. Dr. Stettin said patients would be better served by using the company’s specialty pharmacy, Accredo, which has pharmacists that specialize in inflammatory conditions. He cited company data showing that patients with those conditions were more likely to take their drugs when they used Accredo compared with other pharmacies. But some industry observers said the move was a ploy to build Accredo’s   business, by essentially locking in patients whose employers opt in to the new program, then making money by filling the prescription. “They really, really want their hands on that script,” said Michael Rea, the chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, which advises employers on how to reduce drug costs.",0
20689,20689,"On Hillary Clinton’s Rough Day, Republicans Rue Missed Chance - The New York Times",Jonathan Martin,"WASHINGTON  —   As the Republican strategist Brian Walsh watched the nonstop cable news coverage Tuesday from his K Street office, he thought he was seeing the stuff of his party’s dreams. A week after former President Bill Clinton lit a political firestorm by strolling onto Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch’s plane for a private conversation, the director of the F. B. I. announced that the bureau would not recommend criminal charges over Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information. And then, just three hours later, President Obama and Mrs. Clinton emerged arm in arm from Air Force One in North Carolina for their first joint campaign rally. But this politically pregnant convergence of events was not met with a battalion of   Republican law enforcement and national security officials flooding the television airwaves to raise questions about the inquiry and hammer Mrs. Clinton. Nor was there any     video contrasting what the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, called Mrs. Clinton’s “extremely careless” handling of 110 classified emails with the former secretary of state’s shifting explanations over the last year about her use of a private email server. There were not even any talking points sent to leading Republican members of Congress offering guidance on the best lines of attack against Mrs. Clinton in the aftermath of what was a remarkably harsh assessment of her conduct. “Instead we’re relying on somebody who’s tweeting with exclamation points,” said Mr. Walsh, referring to Donald J. Trump’s initial response to Mr. Comey’s news conference. Mr. Trump’s improvisational response to the conclusion of an F. B. I. investigation against his opponent that had been months in the making illustrated the lingering deficiencies of his skeletal campaign and the lack of   Republicans with foreign policy experience who are willing to speak on his behalf. For many in the party it also was a painful reminder of what could have been  —   how a different   could have capitalized on one of the most difficult days Mrs. Clinton has faced as a candidate. For the Republican establishment, the months since Mr. Trump began closing in on the presidential nomination have been a season of dismay and frustration: Handed a historically weak Democratic opponent to run against, the party’s voters responded by nominating a candidate even more unpopular and toxic than Mrs. Clinton. But there have been few days during this cycle of disbelief in which the sense of regret has been as palpable for Republican strategists and policy makers as when Mr. Comey jolted the political world back to life after a long holiday weekend. “Imagine Jeb Bush looking disappointed and talking about the importance of following the rules and a society ruled by law with a government that is held accountable,” said Kori Schake, a fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution and a national security aide in George W. Bush’s administration who is now backing Mrs. Clinton. “This should be a really great moment for a Republican nominee. But there’s no way in the world Donald Trump could pull that off. ” Mr. Trump’s campaign did, in fact, issue a longer statement regarding Mrs. Clinton’s email use beyond his initial assessment of “very very unfair!” and he used his own rally Tuesday night in North Carolina to assail his Democratic rival. “We are talking about the safety of our people,” he told a crowd in Raleigh. “The laws are very explicit. Stupidity is not a reason that you’re going to be innocent. ” Yet for many in his own party, there was deep angst over the possibility that they could lose to a Democratic candidate who was just deemed by one of the country’s most highly respected law enforcement officials to have presided over a State Department whose lackadaisical security culture invited foreign hackers. “He’s making somebody who should be sitting in a jail cell look like the sane choice for president,” said John Noonan, a former Air Force officer who served as a national security aide to Mitt Romney in 2012 and in Mr. Bush’s campaign this year. “This should have been a   putt. But Republicans never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. And that’s what we’ve done. ” What was especially exasperating to so many in the party was that the turn of events over the last week was only the latest opportunity in a month for Mr. Trump to go on the offensive. The Islamic   rampage in Orlando, Fla. and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union offered him prime political moments, but he unnecessarily inserted himself into each story and saw no improvement in his standing in the polls. “Trump overtakes news cycles at every turn,” complained Mr. Walsh. “My God, he was on his golf course saying what a good thing the pound’s collapse would be for his bottom line. ” (Some Republicans feared Mr. Trump was again frittering away an opportunity when, rather than focusing entirely on the F. B. I. probe, he used his speech on Tuesday night to offer praise for Saddam Hussein.) However, in a campaign year animated by a voter revolt against Washington and the perceived   of an    political class there may be no more of a gift than what Mr. Comey delivered to an outsider candidate like Mr. Trump, whose jeremiads against what he calls a “rigged” system have been central to his improbable rise. “This is an example of what voters are totally fed up with,” said Liesl Hickey, the former executive director of the House Republican campaign arm, alluding to the F. B. I. ’s decision to not recommend charges. But Ms. Hickey, pointing out that Mr. Trump refuses to release his income tax returns, noted that the candidate also bore his own baggage on the very argument he is making against Mrs. Clinton. “Americans also think the system is rigged for the top 1 percent, so they think the system could be rigged for him, too,” she said. Whether it is with his taxes, his pronouncements or his willingness to raise money and create a sophisticated organization, Mr. Trump has gleefully flouted convention. “He doesn’t think traditional campaigns matter as much anymore, that he can do this on social media,” said Jim Merrill, a New   Republican strategist. “But the truth is, running a campaign still matters a great deal. And if we had nominated anyone else we’d be up on Hillary. But we’re down because we’ve got an incompetent candidate who has alienated large swaths of the electorate. ” For his part, Mr. Walsh was just flabbergasted that his party had a nominee whose war room often seems to begin and end with the candidate’s Twitter feed. “Why would he rush out a tweet as his primary response?” wondered Mr. Walsh. “He’s just demonstrating he is unable or unwilling to appear presidential at moments like this, when it’s required. ”",0
20690,20690,Способен ли кто-нибудь помешать Соросу стать «властителем мира»? | Новое восточное обозрение,nan,"Регион: США в мире Как отмечает в своей новой статье американский журналист Мартин Бергер, непосредственная причастность американского миллиардера и финансиста Джорджа Сороса к беспорядкам, начавшимся в США после победы Дональда Трампа на президентских выборах, сегодня уже вряд ли у кого вызывает сомнения. Джордж Сорос и другие богатые либералы, потратившие десятки миллионов долларов на кампанию Хиллари Клинтон, собрались в Вашингтоне в воскресенье вечером на трехдневную закрытую конференцию, чтобы перегруппировать силы в борьбе против Дональда Трампа . Либералы планируют полноценную позиционную войну против Трампа с первого же дня его вступления в должность. Как отмечает автор, параноидальное стремление Сороса управлять миром, финансировать выгодные прежде всего ему политические скандалы и смены правящих элит в различных странах широко известно. Благодаря обнародованным хакерами материалам, стало известно, что фонд Джорджа Сороса «Открытое общество» пытался повлиять на политические процессы во многих европейских государствах. Магната неоднократно обвиняли в причастности к цветным революциям в странах Восточной Европы, на Украине, в Грузии. В августе с.г. Сорос, как сообщили многие СМИ, потратил 33 млн долларов на поддержку объединений, которые фактически разжигали беспорядки в Фергюсоне. Сорос фигурирует среди крупнейших доноров предвыборной кампании кандидата в президенты США от Демократической партии Хиллари Клинтон, безвозмездно выделив ей 9 млн долларов. Сегодня он стоит за акциями протеста в США, которые продолжаются после легитимных, свободных выборов 45-го президента. Спонсируемое им движение организуется при помощи соцсетей. Активисты MoveOn . org организовали более 200 «мирных акций», некоторые из которых оказались омрачены вандализмом и насилием. Как отметил известный финансовый и политический обозреватель делового портала Live Trading News Поль Эбелинг , основной целью спонсируемого Соросом движения против Трампа является воспрепятствование усилиям администрации нового президента США отделаться от глобалистской политики Клинтонов и президента Барака Обамы. Однако, как отмечает автор, вряд ли Соросу, поджигавшему своими долларами многие цветные революции за рубежом, удастся и дальше безнаказанно «мутить воду», особенно в США в новую эпоху – «эпоху Трапа».

20691,20691,That’s Not the Burglar Growling. It’s His Stomach. - The New York Times,Michael Wilson,"The Office of Chief Medical Examiner, which operates New York City’s DNA laboratory, tests all manner of objects for microscopic evidence that could link a suspect to a crime. This is a story about a small and bizarre subset of those objects, evidence left by criminals feeding that most basic of human appetites. Literally feeding. Criminals who eat in the act. “Partially eaten apple,” a spokeswoman for the medical examiner’s office wrote when asked for examples. “Sunflower seed shells.   chocolate cake. Chewed gum. ” When she got to “  biscuit,” the list was not yet half over. “Chicken bones. Chicken wing. Pizza crust. Fruit pit. ” For the victim of a home burglary, it would seem to be yet another affront after the crime: the violation of the kitchen and the discovery, while perhaps seeking simple comfort in the stress, of a lowly pit where once there was fruit. That violation was last seen in this space earlier this month, in the tale of a Brooklyn man whose attempt to rent his apartment to a stranger went terribly awry. But the phenomenon of the hungry burglar is timeless. An article in The New York Times on May 17, 1886, described the theft of nearly 100 pieces of flatware from the Poughkeepsie mansion of a fallen general’s widow. “After completing their pillage,” the story noted, the burglars “went down to the kitchen and brought upstairs to the parlor cooked meats, bread, cake, eggs and milk, and partook of the banquet there and then. ” The peculiar act of eating at the scene of the crime occurs often enough to warrant mention in police textbooks like “Criminal Investigation: A Method for Reconstructing the Past. ” A burglar may take food from the kitchen, the authors, James W. Osterburg and Richard H. Ward, write, “or display other forms of aberrational behavior that help establish a modus operandi. ” It is far from uncommon in New York City. “Happens all the time,” Detective Anthony Barbee in Brooklyn told me a few years ago. “One of the questions we always ask people, ‘Look in your refrigerator. Is there anything open?’ Maybe they’re neat freaks and they notice something moved around. They look at you like you’re crazy. ” The act defies criminal logic. “I would assume, you’re a burglar, you have an adrenaline rush, you want to get in and out,” Detective Barbee said. “But some people make themselves at home. They get comfortable. ” Others take their refreshments to go. Last year, a tenant in an apartment in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan came home to discover that someone had stolen a credit card, a laptop, sunglasses  —   and a bottle of alcohol. A man in Queens answered a knock at his door last August, let in two women who were pretending to need a bathroom and even offered one of them a slice of cake. After they left, he realized he had been robbed. Officers quickly found the women, who had cash from the man’s home, among other things. “In stopping the vehicle,” prosecutors later said, “police allegedly recovered cake. ” In 2011, a woman in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, came home to find a large hole in her window screen, and her electronics and watches missing. There was a note: “Thanks for the O. J.,” it read in part. “Have a nice day. ” Steve Panagopoulos, a retired Brooklyn detective, said he associated food theft with addiction: “These guys are   junkies. ” “Think about it,” he said last week. “They don’t really even care about getting caught. Taking their time, sitting there opening refrigerators, that’s pretty crazy. ” That sort of behavior was the undoing of one serial thief he remembered. “He had taken out a thing of cheese, crackers,” Mr. Panagopoulos said. “He left them behind on the table. That was processed for DNA. ” A former detective in Chinatown once shared the story of an epic intrusion visited upon the apartment of a woman who had left for a week to care for her mother. “They came in and used the pots and stove and cooked,” the former detective, Jose Santiago, said. “They hung out, smoked a couple joints, ate. ” Soon they had company. “Word got out in the building,” the detective said. “One person would go in and take a TV. Literally couches, everything. She was cleaned out. ” Cleaned out, but no one cleaned up: “There was food in the pots when she got home,” he said. Perhaps the pots were sent to the laboratory of the medical examiner. There, they would have found company in the other evidence left by criminals who eat at the scene. “Candy wrappers, lollipop,” the spokeswoman’s list read, finally ending with a New York City flourish. “And, of course, a bagel. ”",0

20694,20694,Four Illegal Aliens Arrested After ’Savage’ Gang-Related Killing of MD Teen,Katie McHugh,"Imported gang violence continues to afflict Virginia: authorities charged illegal alien suspects with murder and all ten suspects for gang participation and abduction on Thursday for the “brutal” slaying of    Damaris Reyes Rivas. [Police arrested ten in connection with Rivas’ death: four adults and six teenagers. FOX5 reports “Jose Ivan Castillo Rivas, 18, Springfield, Wilmer A. Sanchez Serrano, 21, Cindy Blanco Hernandez, 18, and Aldair J. Miranda Carcamo, 18” are adults. Another    Venus Iraheta, who has lived in the U. S. for the past ten years —  making her a “DREAMer” eligible for amnesty under an Obama executive order —  is also in police custody. Police did not identify the other five juveniles. All ten face charges of abduction and gang participation. Rivas and Serrano are charged with murder.  Rivas died horribly on or close to January 8 of   trauma in a “savage, brutal killing,” Fairfax County Police Chief Edwin Roessler said. Police reportedly found video evidence of Rivas’ death and declined to name the gang connected to the teenager’s murder. According to Maria Reyes, Rivas’ mother, her daughter had gotten involved with the El Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha or   recently. She told FOX 5 she is receiving violent threats from gang members “blaming her for the arrests” and is afraid for her own life. U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement placed detainers on the four adults charged with murder and has asked Fairfax County to alert them before they are released from custody.   of the total population of El Salvador lives in the U. S. “El Salvador is the top country of birth for immigrants to Virginia,” the Associated Press reported in 2014. Nearly a quarter, or 23 percent, of Northern Virginia residents are foreigners, and 68 percent of the state’s   population lives there, researchers found in 2014. In 1970, only one in 100 residents in Virginia was   —  but now, it is one in nine. Roughly 247, 000 illegal aliens live in Virginia, according to one estimate, meaning the state ranks in the top ten states with the largest populations of illegals. Among those are nearly 40, 000 illegals from El Salvador. Another estimate pegged the total number of illegals at 275, 000 in 2012, or 3. 5 percent of the state’s population. Similarly, immigration led to a boom in the Latino or Hispanic population in Old Dominion since the 1990s: “The Latino share of Virginia’s population grew from 2. 6 percent in 1990 to 4. 7 percent in 2000 to 8. 6 percent (or 707, 962 people) in 2013,” according to the American Immigration Council. Without immigration from El Salvador, there would be no   in America and fewer machete murders and dismembered bodies buried in idyllic parks. Since the 1990s,   has operated in the Washington, D. C. area with thousands of members. Obama administration policies encouraged hundreds of thousands of Central American illegal aliens to surge into the U. S. and the administration helped them along by shipping them unannounced to unsuspecting American communities.   leaders stationed in El Salvador had told the U. S.  gangs to rebuild, and the large influx of young illegal aliens made the task easier. The Obama administration shipped illegal alien minors with clear   ties to   strongholds. One Department of Homeland Security official noted an “uptick” in   gang violence in the past two years, according to FOX5: “He said   and    in high schools work to recruit younger kids to help them carry out crimes because they are aware charges are less serious for juveniles. ” El Salvadoran nationals involved in gang violence at home bring their connections and plans for expansion to the United States. Chairman of the Northern Virginia Regional Gang Task Force Douglas W. Keen pointed to “increased recruitment of unaccompanied minors” illegally arriving in the U. S. “When we debrief some of the arrestees they are telling us they were recruited at a young age and encouraged to commit crimes of assaults and larcenies. Then they move to narcotics and more violent crimes,” Keen told the Washington Post. Director of the task force Jay Lanham also told FOX5 that gangs “are recruiting people as young as children in elementary school and they lure them through social media and parties where they offer them drugs, alcohol, and sex. ” Taxpayers, of course, foot the bill for the illegal aliens’ schooling, social services, trials, incarceration, and the specialized task forces required to keep their explosive violence under control.",0

20696,20696,Comment on 10 Strange Facts About Our Presidents by tania de saram,tania de saram,"10 Strange Facts About Our Presidents   July 25, 2015 Subscribe 
They may well be some of the most recognizable men on the face of the Earth: Our Presidents. Think you know all there is to know from history about these men? Think again and take a look at these strange facts: Presidential Alligators 

Two different Presidents had pet alligators: John Quincy Adams and Herbert Hoover. 
Adams received his pet alligator as a gift from a French general, and it lived in an unfinished bathroom of the White House. Hoover’s son had two alligators that frequently roamed the White House grounds. Bet that kept the Secret Service on their toes. Greek and Latin 

James Garfield, our 20th President, could write well with each hand, but he also could write Greek with one hand and Latin with the other at the same time! Try that sometime! Cool Coolidge 
Calvin Coolidge was fond of pranking the White House staff by pressing all the buttons in the Oval Office just to watch everyone run in frantically, unsure of what was wrong. The Rough Rider Roosevelt 
During a speech in Milwaukee, a failed assassin shot Teddy Roosevelt in the chest. His next words were, “I don’t know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot.” When everyone attempted to take him to the hospital, he waved them off and finished his 90 minute speech with the bullet still lodged in his chest! Now that’s toughness! Dueling Jackson 
President Andrew Jackson was involved in over 100 duels, most to protect the reputation of his wife. In one, Jackson offered his opponent the first shot. The man shot Jackson, but Jackson merely shook it off, like it was a bee sting, then shot and killed the unlucky opponent. Fashion Model Before Gerald Ford was President, he worked as a fashion model in New York City. He even made it to the cover of Cosmopolitan with Phyllis Brown in 1942. Out-Of-This-World Carter 
Before he became President, Jimmy Carter was making a speech in Georgia when he saw a UFO. He filed a report of the incident with the International UFO Bureau stating that it was a self-illuminating, bright white object hovering in the sky. Bartender-In-Chief 
Before Abraham Lincoln was the President, he was a lawyer. But before that he was he was a bartender. He owned a saloon, Berry and Lincoln, with his friend William Berry. Bushusuru 
Poppy Bush was in Asia for a trade conference. At a state event held by the Japanese Prime Minister, Bush fainted after vomiting all over the banquet host. The Japanese later coined the term “Bushusuru” meaning “to do the Bush thing” or “to vomit.” Gambling Harding 
Warren Harding loved to play poker, and during one game he bet a set of priceless White House china, which he promptly lost.

20697,20697,Outsiders Selected by Trump Aim to Unnerve Washington - The New York Times,Michael D. Shear,"They are   Donald J. Trump’s disrupters. Seven men and one woman named by Mr. Trump to run vast government agencies share a common trait: once they are confirmed, their presence is meant to unnerve  —   and maybe even outright undermine  —   the bureaucracies they are about to lead. Some of those chosen  —   17 picks so far for federal agencies and five for the White House  —   are among the most radical selections in recent history. Other presidents’ nominees, even when controversial, were often veterans of the Washington bureaucracy and generally believed in it. But a number of Mr. Trump’s most important selections have no experience in federal government and a great drive to undo it. Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma state attorney general who was picked to lead the E. P. A. rejects the established science of   climate change and has built his career on fighting environmental regulations. At the Education Department, Betsy DeVos wants to steer government money away from traditional public schools. Rick Perry was picked to head the Energy Department  —   unless he eliminates it, as he once promised. Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the conservative Republican who was chosen as White House budget director, refused to back the 2011 deal to raise the federal debt limit and helped to bring the United States to the brink of default. “Donald Trump ran to make the governing people uncomfortable,” said Andrew H. Card Jr. who served as chief of staff to former President George W. Bush and as transportation secretary for his father. “He clearly picked people to lead some of these departments who will be challenging to the insiders. ” As Mr. Trump finishes announcing his choices for cabinet and senior White House aides, a picture is emerging of an administration with little ideological cohesion and no single animating purpose. They are neither all   conservatives, nor all mainstream conservatives. They are not all insiders or outsiders. Some have known Mr. Trump for years. Others met him in the weeks since he was elected. Instead, Mr. Trump has recruited people to lead his government who can be roughly grouped into categories that appeal to the different parts of his psyche. In addition to the disrupters, there are the dealmakers, the loyalists, the establishment and the generals. Mr. Trump’s administration so far reflects the people who worked for and advised him during the campaign. It is mostly men, and mostly white. Many of his picks are extraordinarily rich, though not all. Loyalty is at a premium  —   except when it isn’t. (Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s choice for national security adviser, was an early supporter who was rewarded. Todd Ricketts, who may become deputy commerce secretary, was a leader of the “Never Trump” movement.) There is “no overarching theory,” said Pete Wehner, who was deputy director of speechwriting for Mr. Bush and a fierce critic of Mr. Trump during the campaign. “He’s not being driven by the usual impulses, which would be policy or ideology or political philosophy. ” Here is a look at the groups: Few things made Mr. Trump’s campaign supporters roar with approval more than when he hammered the “political class in Washington,” telling people at his rallies that the government had betrayed them, and vowing that change was coming. At many agencies, it may soon arrive. In addition to Ms. DeVos, Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Perry and Mr. Mulvaney, the disrupters include Ben Carson, chosen to lead the Housing Department Andrew Puzder as labor secretary Representative Tom Price of Georgia to oversee the Health and Human Services Department and Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as attorney general. The disrupters appear to have been picked in part for their singular ability to shake up the normal course of business at their agencies. Mr. Sessions, whose 1986 nomination as a federal judge was rejected by the   Senate because of testimony from colleagues that he was a racist, is likely to push for wholesale changes at the Justice Department by imposing conservative positions on immigration, terrorism, crime, drugs and guns. He is almost certain to reverse   efforts to confront civil rights violations, sentencing disparities and police abuses. Mr. Carson, a surgeon who has no experience in housing or running a large government agency, has already put housing advocates on notice that he does not think much of current programs for the poor. Mr. Puzder, who owns   chains and is opposed to raising the minimum wage, is a longtime critic of his department’s approach. Mr. Price, who waged a crusade against the Affordable Care Act in Congress, could soon be in a position at H. H. S. to lead the drive to repeal and replace it. Mr. Trump demonstrated his desire for a disruptive force when he named Mr. Pruitt to head the nation’s top environmental agency. While saying that his administration “strongly believes in environmental protection,” he previewed the kind of change he is looking for. “For too long, the Environmental Protection Agency has spent taxpayer dollars on an      agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs,” he said, adding that Mr. Pruitt “will reverse this trend. ” As he creates an administration in his own image, perhaps no category is more natural for the author of “The Art of the Deal” than the dealmakers. Mr. Trump, who puts a premium on the ability to negotiate in business and finance, has chosen Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor, to lead the Commerce Department Steven Mnuchin of Goldman Sachs to lead the Treasury Department and Rex W. Tillerson, the chairman of Exxon Mobil, who has a longtime relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, to be secretary of state. “To me, a great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well,” Mr. Trump said last week during an interview about Mr. Tillerson on “Fox News Sunday. ” “He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company  —   not for himself  —   for the company. ” Mr. Mnuchin made a fortune through financial deals and now becomes the nation’s top financial official. Mr. Ross, a “vulture” investor on Wall Street, bought nearly dead companies and made huge profits when his turnaround strategies worked. Like most future presidents, Mr. Trump has also positioned loyal, trusted aides to be close to him at the White House. Four of the loyalists  —   Reince Priebus, who will be White House chief of staff Stephen K. Bannon, chief strategist Donald F. McGahn II, White House counsel and Mr. Flynn, national security adviser  —   will occupy the most coveted real estate in the West Wing. The president has also tapped Linda McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, to oversee the Small Business Administration. Ms. McMahon has known Mr. Trump for years, long before he considered running for president. In 2007 on W. W. E. Mr. Trump took down Vince McMahon, Ms. McMahon’s husband and the chairman of the organization, in what was billed as the “Battle of the Billionaires. ” All five loyalists stuck by Mr. Trump during the toughest of times in the campaign. Mr. Priebus, the departing chairman of the Republican Party, came late to joining the Trump team, but refused to waver publicly when the Washington establishment was rushing to condemn Mr. Trump during various scandals, particularly a leaked “Access Hollywood” recording that captured Mr. Trump boasting about grabbing women by their genitals. Mr. Bannon, who has been accused of embracing white nationalist views as the head of Breitbart News, was always there, whispering advice to Mr. Trump in the background, if not officially in charge of campaign strategy. Mr. Flynn and Mr. McGahn are veterans of Mr. Trump’s campaign world, having secured their posts in the administration through longevity. Loyalty goes only so far, however. Four of Mr. Trump’s most avid supporters so far have no role in the new administration: Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City. If there was one group Mr. Trump repeatedly derided on the campaign trail, it was the establishment. It was filled with the “stupid” people who ran the government poorly, Mr. Trump said. It represented the Washington swamp that he pledged to drain. When it looked like he might not win, he blamed them. But Mr. Trump hasn’t shunned the establishment as he sets up his government. He has chosen Nikki Haley, the governor of South Carolina, as his envoy to the United Nations Representative Michael Pompeo of Kansas for C. I. A. director and Elaine Chao as his secretary of transportation. Ms. Haley, a rising star in the Republican establishment, endorsed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the primaries. Mr. Pompeo, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, is   in the nation’s capital. And there are few people who define the Republican establishment more than Ms. Chao, who, in addition to having served in cabinet posts during both Bush administrations, is married to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Ultimately there may be no more direct expression of Mr. Trump’s psyche in his administration picks than the generals. Despite saying during the campaign that he knew more about the Islamic State than generals did, Mr. Trump is now embracing the retired leaders of America’s military. That explains Gen. James N. Mattis, who was responsible for American military operations in the Middle East as head of United States Central Command, or Centcom, and is now Mr. Trump’s pick for defense secretary. It also explains Gen. John F. Kelly, who oversaw American military operations in Central and South America as head of United States Southern Command and is now Mr. Trump’s choice for homeland security secretary. It also may help frame his choice of Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, a former Navy SEAL commander, to be interior secretary. While not a general, Mr. Zinke served in Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo and the Pacific. His autobiography, “American Commander,” was published recently. Mr. Trump particularly likes “Mad Dog Mattis,” the former Centcom commander’s nickname. “Mad Dog Mattis!” Mr. Trump said to a roar of applause at a recent rally in Fayetteville, N. C. “Mad Dog plays no games, right?” Mr. Trump called General Mattis, who led a Marine division to Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, one of “the most effective generals that we’ve had in many, many decades. ”",0
20698,20698,How to Have a Green Vacation - The New York Times,Shivani Vora,"With the United Nations designating 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, there has never been a better time to be more environmentally conscious when traveling. And, it’s not hard to do, according to Costas Christ, the director of sustainability for the luxury travel network Virtuoso. “Being greener on vacation doesn’t take a lot of effort or mean sacrificing pleasure,” he said. Below, Mr. Christ’s top tips on traveling green: Book Hotels With Green Practices  Many properties include green efforts on their websites, or you can ask the concierge or reservations department about the hotel’s green programs. “It could be an extensive recycling program, using LED lighting or having power systems that expend less energy,” he said. Two of his favorite properties with a green footprint include the Brando in French Polynesia, which is operated on renewable energy, and Three Camel Lodge in Mongolia, which composts its kitchen waste for use in a solar greenhouse producing fresh ingredients for the restaurant. Carry a Reusable Shopping Bag Traveling with a reusable bag is a way to avoid contributing to plastic bag pollution, a significant concern in many parts of the world. Use the bag to carry the souvenirs you buy on your trip. Locals will welcome it, too. Mr. Christ said that when he was buying fruit at a roadside stand in Belize in January, the vendor thanked him for bringing his own bag and told him it saves her money because she has to buy fewer bags for her shoppers, and it makes for less litter, too. Say ‘No’ to Plastic Water Bottles They are readily and inexpensively available, but the waste from plastic bottles clogs up landfills and pollutes the ocean. Mr. Christ advised either taking a reusable bottle from home or asking your tour operator or hotel for one and refilling it with purified water. Transportation Can Be Green, Too. Relying on biking or walking to explore your destination helps the environment because both create minimal carbon emissions. They also give the traveler a better sense of place. If you’re flying to your destination, use a reputable carbon offset provider, like MyClimate, a nonprofit group that supports   projects, and pick nonstop flights versus connections  —   fewer flights mean fewer carbon emissions. Also, go for a   rental car, an option with many companies today. Hertz, for example, has the Green Traveler Collection, a fleet of hybrid cars that are affordable to rent. Eat Local Enjoying meals that emphasize local ingredients, Mr. Christ said, means fewer fossil fuels are involved because they didn’t travel far to reach your plate. Also, he suggested avoiding shrimp. “Unless otherwise specified, a lot of shrimp comes from aquaculture ponds bulldozed out of tropical mangrove forests,” he said. “Basically, the environment was destroyed to produce that shrimp. ”",0
20699,20699,Exclusive: Front National Candidate Reveals Party’s Potential New Name,Chris Tomlinson,"PARIS, France: Front National legislative candidate Aymeric Durox has exclusively revealed to Breitbart London the new name of the Front National could be “Les Patriotes” or the Patriots. [Mr. Durox said the name change, which was talked about on Sunday evening following the defeat of   migration candidate Marine Le Pen, is likely to be Les Patriotes citing the office of vice president of the party Florian Philippot registering the name in 2015.  “I know that the director of the cabinet of Florian Philippot filed the name ‘Les Patriotes’ in April 2015, perhaps already with the prospect of a name change, but nothing is sure,” he told Breitbart London. He said the legacy of the name Front National still “scared off”  some voters and a name change and rebranding could bring more people into the movement. The Front National, or perhaps soon Les Patriotes, are challenging the establishment parties in next month’s French legislative elections. Mr. Durox, who is standing in Paris, said all the establishment candidates he is facing are old and have out of date ideas. “I shall incarnate the true change of my generation,” said the    who is a history and geography teacher. Durox was dismissive of his opponents saying they “have the presumption to pretend that they represent a real alternative”. The Front National is expected to win a minimum of 15 seats in the upcoming election, though some have forecast they could gain as many as 50 seats in the French National Assembly.  Durox said the party should look toward forming a group in the assembly, which would take at least 15 deputies, in order to be able to have more time to speak in the chamber and have more influence. “In any case 50 [deputies] would be a good number, especially if we are superior in numbers to the Socialist party,” he added. Currently, the Front National has two members in the assembly, one of which is Marion   Pen who recently announced her resignation from politics following the presidential election.   Pen said she wanted more time to spend with her young daughter away from the stresses of political life. “When a brave leader leaves his troops it is always very sad, but she is very young and we are sure that she will come back even stronger,” Durox said in reaction to the news of   Pen’s decision. He added: “The future belongs to her. ” Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart. com ",0
20700,20700,Leaked Emails Reveal Hillary Can’t Speak for Very Long Without a Podium… So Were the Debates Rigged?,admin,"The Daily Sheeple October 26, 2016 
Wikileaks continues to be a treasure trove of info about the behind-the-scenes rigging of what is turning out to be the most infamous presidential election in American history. 
Remember the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and the conspiracy surrounding “podiumgate” ? 
Hillary required a specially built podium under the pretext that she didn’t want to appear shorter than Trump. 
After the debate was over, however, a sneaky “cleaner man” was caught on tape approaching Hillary’s podium multiple times, removing various items and looking as shady as possible while doing it. What could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in Trump’s just after the debate officially ended. 
This led to lots of speculation on whether or not Hillary cheated during the first debate against Trump and other debates as well, having her comments fed to her. 
Well, if the Wikileaks Podesta emails are any indication, it’s very possible. Why? A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Because apparently Hillary can’t give long speeches without a podium. 
In fact, these emails (and this isn’t even all of them, but enough for you to get the picture) prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept “short and sweet” unless Hillary has a podium. 
So how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the 90-minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow?

20701,20701,Top Radio Host Michael Savage: “We’re Being Invaded Right Now”,Selwyn Duke,"Email 
Not all invasions are hot — not all invaders come with guns and bombs. And Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and other Western leaders are “invading their own countries,” says radio host Michael Savage, using a foreign army introduced under the banner of “immigration,” “illegal migration” and “refugee status.” 
Writes WND.com , “History isn’t about tolerance or peace or understanding. History is about war. History is about conflict. History is about invasions — and the most consequential invasion in human history is well underway.” WND isn’t talking about just an American problem, a German problem, a Swedish problem, or a French problem, but one that threatens to extinguish all of the greatest civilization ever to grace our planet: Western civilization. And this is effected via what’s euphemistically called “demographic change.” 
Consider the United States. In 1965, close to 90 percent of Americans were of European descent, were of the Western tradition. That percentage now stands at 62 — and falls further each passing day. What happened? The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 happened. Introduced by Congressman Emanuel Celler (D-N.Y.) and aggressively promoted in the Senate by Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), it created a situation in which legal immigration would swell from an average of 250,000 immigrants a year to approximately one million, causing the rate of immigration to exceed the rate of assimilation. Moreover, 85 percent of these new immigrants would come from the Third World, leading to rapid demographic change. Note that this is something Kennedy had promised would not occur . 
And now, though the United States is teeming with unassimilable foreigners, and citizens must press buttons to conduct business in their native language. Obama has accelerated the process by inviting waves of illegals into our nation and granting “refugee status” gratuitously. As WND tells us, quoting Savage and discussing his new book on the subject, Scorched Earth : “We’re being invaded from the south. We’re being invaded from the north, from the east and from the west. You might say, ‘Well, that’s the way of things,’ and you might get used to it. They’re here, they’re near, they’re everywhere. The question is, why are liberals so quick to embrace this invasion, and why are traditionalists and conservatives like myself so resistant to erasing the borders, language and culture of this great nation?” [said Savage][.] More than 3 million foreigners came to the United States in 2014 and 2015 according to a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies. The foreign-born population in the United States, now standing at 43.3 million people, is at an all-time high. Immigrants now make up almost 14 percent of the population, the highest percentage in 105 years. 
Of course, liberals aren’t only quick to embrace this invasion, they’ve authored it. Why? 
Power. 
Seventy to 90 percent of the Third World and Muslim immigrants in the United States vote for leftists upon being naturalized. This pattern holds throughout the Western world. For instance, in France, where Islamic immigration has become a contentious issue, approximately 90 percent of Muslims voted for socialist president Francois Hollande in 2012. Leftists know this and joyfully import voters. As Andrew Neather, former advisor to ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair, confessed in 2009, the massive immigration into the United Kingdom over the previous 15 years was designed by his Labour Party to “rub the Right's nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date.” 
But it’s rendering Western civilization “out of date,” a fact that hasn’t escaped hostile foreign entities. As late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said in 2006 while commenting on the “cold invasion,” “We have 50 million Muslims in Europe. There are signs that Allah will grant Islam victory in Europe — without swords, without guns, without conquest — will turn it into a Muslim continent within a few decades.” 
And the “enemy within,” as Savage would put it, celebrates this rending of the West with a demonic hatred of what should be their own culture. Just consider that Swedish multiculturalist social engineer and Social Democrat politician Mona Sahlin actually said in 2001 that ""the Swedes must be integrated into the new Sweden; the old Sweden is never coming back."" Of course, if a corresponding sentiment had been expressed by a backwoods tribesman about his own tribe, it would be viewed as most odd; many would call him a traitor. And when a rainforest-dwelling tribe is overwhelmed by outsiders — or when the Tibetans are inundated with ethnic Chinese, which has been happening — anthropologists will condemn it as demographic and cultural genocide. In the West, though, it’s marketed as “multiculturalism.” 
And we’re told, “Our strength lies in our diversity.” 
Obama knows precisely what he’s doing, too, says Savage, and is purposely deconstructing our nation. “Obama is invading his own country. He’s destroying it from within, like a worm in an apple,” said the radio host. No doubt. In fact, Obama stated last year that over the long term he was “pretty optimistic” that conservatism would be extinguished “because this country just becomes more and more of a hodgepodge of folks.” 
Even more damningly, it was alleged in 2015 that there’s a secret Obama administration plot to use the new illegal aliens as “seedlings” that will develop a “country within a country”; these foreigners will “navigate, not assimilate” as they eventually “take over the host,” coming “out of the shadows” and “pushing the citizens into the shadows,” the report informed . 
In this vein, WND mentions that at issue isn’t just the massive number of im/migrants, but also their nature. The site further points out that this creeping Third Worldism has already turned states such as California into socialist bastions that vote reliably Democrat. For sure. As I wrote in 2010, placing the matter in perspective: If we imported millions of Scandinavians — who have created the most liberal governments on Earth — would we expect them to magically change their ideology upon seeing American terra firma? If not, why would we expect otherwise with south-of-the-border socialists? If they choose Hugo Chavez and Evo Morales types below the Rio Grande, why wouldn’t they above it? Geography doesn’t change ideology. 
It doesn’t change jihadist zeal, either. Referring to the recent influx of Muslim migrants into the United States — Obama has welcomed more than 13,000 almost exclusively Muslim “Syrian refugees” already this year — Savage mentioned that these individuals cannot actually be vetted and thus are unknown quantities. Moreover, he points out that Obama is preventing border-patrol agents and the police from enforcing immigration law, as the president “invades his own country with a de facto army from other nations,” as the radio legend put it. He characterizes Obama as “dangerous” and as a “psychopath” bent on replacing the population of his own country. 
Of course, Obama did telegraph his intentions in 2008, promising “fundamental change.” Note that “fundamental” means “ serving as, or being an essential part of, a foundation or basis .” If a man says his wife requires fundamental change, he doesn’t just mean she needs a new hairdo or wardrobe, or even cosmetic surgery. He means that he doesn’t like the very essence of what she is and wants her transformed into a completely different person. 
As for the Left’s destruction of the West, it will continue unless and until Western voters enforce fundamental change — and divorce leftism, permanently, from their cultures and governments. Photo of Michael Savage: AP Images Please review our Comment Policy before posting a comment

20702,20702,"Kim Davis Could Pay As Much As $225,000 In Legal Costs For Her Publicity Stunt",James DeVinne,"Comments 
Kim Davis, the infamous marriage-denying county clerk from Kentucky, could be facing more than $225,000 in legal fees. Davis, who claimed she was acting “under God’s authority” and quickly became a hero for many religious conservatives, has been hit with an appeal seeking to have her pay her opponents’ legal fees, which total $233,058. 
Davis’ legal troubles began soon after her stunt last summer when four couples (two same-sex and two straight) sued her for her refusal to carry out national law. The case gained national attention after Davis was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court and made a martyr of herself. The suit itself was ultimately resolved earlier this year after Kentucky’s governor changed state law to the effect that county clerks no longer authorize marriage licenses. 
Davis has not been responsible for her own legal fees, as the anti-LGBT non-profit Liberty Counsel has offered her pro bono services. Now, however, she may finally be forced to pay up as the ACLU, on behalf of the four plaintiff couples, is appealing to US District Judge David Bunning seeking an order allowing them to recoup their legal expenses. Rowan County, which Davis serves as county clerk, has already stated that it will not pay the costs, arguing that Davis was acting on her own behalf rather than the county’s. 
It remains to be seen how the appeal will play out. According to William Sharp, the ACLU of Kentucky’s legal director, 
“ Courts recognize that when successful civil rights plaintiffs obtain a direct benefit from a court-ordered victory, such as in this case, they can be entitled to their legal expenses to deter future civil rights violations by government officials. By filing today’s motion, we hope to achieve that very objective — to send a message to government officials that willful violations of individuals’ rights will be costly” 
Liberty Counsel, however, is contesting the appeal on the grounds that Davis did not technically lose the case since it was resolved by a change in state law.",1
20703,20703,Ethics Complaint Filed Against Rep. Jason Chaffetz for Releasing Comey Clinton Email Letter,Jason Easley,"An ethics complaint has been filed against Representative Jason Chaffetz for releasing information provided to him in a letter from FBI Director James Comey. 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump announced the complaint in a statement: 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint against Representative Jason Chaffetz on Monday morning with the Office of Congressional Ethics for his role in releasing information provided to him by FBI Director James Comey. 
“Representative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clinton’s emails had been reopened, when in fact it had not been. Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place- not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions,” said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. 
Director Comey is already facing a complaint that was filed with Department of Justic e accusing him of violating the Hatch Act by using his position as a federal employee to influence the outcome of an election. 
The Comey letter couldn’t have gone much worse for Republicans. What the GOP originally hoped was an election shifting moment had become a Republican scandal that Democrats are strongly suggesting will inspiring hearings if they win back the Senate majority . 
Thanks to Chaffetz, House Republicans have already their credibility for future Clinton investigations, a s the Utah Republican’s spin of Comey’s letter was debunked in a matter of hours. 
It’s all gone wrong in short order for Republicans. Comey and Chaffetz are facing complaints, and Hillary Clinton remains on course to be elected the next President Of The United States.",1

Bis heute ist die Region so etwas wie Russlands Ruhrpott. Doch die Zeiten ändern sich. Die Kunst hält Einzug in stillgelegte Industriegebiete – wie etwa in die gigantischen Werkshallen von UralMasch. Einst war der Maschinenbauer das Flaggschiff der Sowjetindustrie. Heute ist es ein Eldorado für Künstler und Kreative. Scrollen Sie nach unten um mehr zu sehen Denis Tarasov Von den späten Sechziger- bis in die Neunzigerjahre arbeitete bei UralMasch ein gewisser Gennadij Wlassow. Geboren wurde Wlassow 1943 in Swerdlowsk – heute Jekaterinburg, Hauptstadt der Ural-Region. Denis Tarasov 1961 absolvierte er die UralMasch-Handelsschule und wurde beim Maschinenbauer übernommen. Sein Verantwortungsbereich war die interne Unternehmenskommunikation: Er schrieb Wandzeitungen, entwarf Slogans und zeichnete informativ-satirische Poster. Denis Tarasov In den Achtzigern entdeckte er ein neues Format, um den Industrie-Alltag der Belegschaft zu verschönern: Er fing an, Landschaftsbilder berühmter russischer Künstler auf den Werkzeugspinden in den Werkshallen nachzumalen. Denis Tarasov Unter den berühmten Werken, die er kopierte, war zum Beispiel das „Mädchen mit dem Tragejoch“ und die „Heuernte“ von Arkadij Plastow. Der Sowjetkünstler stellte Alltagsszenen aus dem Dorfleben im Stil des sozialistischen Realismus dar. Zugleich entwarf Wlassow auch Eigenkreationen. Denis Tarasov Irgendwann fingen die UralMasch-Arbeiter an, sich bestimmte Motive für die Werkzeugboxen auszusuchen. Meist waren das Naturlandschaften – in der Spätphase der Industrialisierung war die Kunst eine Möglichkeit aus dem grauen Fabrikalltag auszubrechen. Denis Tarasov Bis heute wirken die malerischen Landschaften wie ein frischer Windzug durch das Riesenreich gewaltiger Maschinen, die zum Schweigen verdammt sind. Denis Tarasov Vor wenigen Jahren tauchten einige dieser Bilder im Internet auf und fielen einer Gruppe von Galeristen ins Auge. Die Liebhaber zeitgenössischer Kunst hatten Wlassows Spinde in ein Projekt verwandelt, das sie im Rahmen einer Biennale in Jekaterinburg vorstellten. Denis Tarasov Die Werkzeugspinde sind ein Beispiel dafür, wie alltägliche Gegenstände zu Kunst werden können, sobald sie in Szene gesetzt sind. Denis Tarasov „Wir waren jahrelang hier und haben uns an den Bildern sattgesehen“, lachen ehemalige UralMasch-Mitarbeiter beim Anblick einer Gruppe, die die Wlassow-Ausstellung besucht. Denis Tarasov Wobei „Ausstellung“ leicht übertrieben ist: Außer dass Kuratoren, Kunstkritiker und Journalisten vorbeikommen, hat sich in den Werkshallen nichts verändert. Facebook",1
20705,20705,Tony Romo’s Star Is Eclipsed by Another Feel-Good Story - The New York Times,Juliet Macur,"FRISCO, Tex.  —   The Dallas Cowboys’ new headquarters is sparkly and showy and so     that it makes the team’s longtime base of operations  —   in Irving, about 20 miles southwest of here  —   look like your grandparents’   rec room. The complex is like an airy, marbled museum, with reminders, maybe every 10 steps, that the Cowboys once were a dynasty: Super Bowl rings, Super Bowl trophies and hagiographic displays of all five of the franchise’s Super Bowl victories. But the shiniest part of the Cowboys these days was not in the complex’s blueprints: It’s Dak Prescott, who came out of nowhere to become the team’s new franchise quarterback. Prescott, a rookie drafted in the fourth round out of Mississippi State, led the team to 11 victories in a row before Sunday’s visit to New Jersey to face the Giants, a feat that not even Troy Aikman or Roger Staubach can claim. But in a visit to Frisco last week, it became even more clear how much Prescott’s ascent, like the team’s gleaming new home, is yet another reminder of one man the Cowboys have left behind: Tony Romo. “I know he wants to play and I know he wants to be out there, but he’s been really good about everything,” Prescott said of Romo. “He’s telling me about   and things he sees with a defense, or things he has seen in the past. He’s great. ” The Great Tony Romo? You’ll have to think back a while to remember how great. Romo was the undrafted rookie who became a Pro Bowl player, leading the Cowboys to four playoff berths and posting only two losing seasons after taking over as the starter in 2006. But while his career propelled the Cowboys forward year after year, it is also sometimes remembered for what Romo did not do when it mattered most. There was the botched hold on a   attempt that probably cost the Cowboys a chance for a playoff win at Seattle in 2007. The loss to the Giants in the postseason a year later that spoiled a   season. The    fades. The poorly thrown balls and the dozens of sacks. And then there were the injuries, which continue to thwart him. Prescott is starting at all only because Romo broke a bone in his back in the preseason  —   after his 2015 season ended early, to boot. Now Romo, 36, is stuck in a position that’s dreaded by every top athlete who knows the clock is ticking on his career: He’s watching the young Prescott lead the greatest Cowboys team in years to the playoffs, and knowing that wherever they go, he will only be along for the ride. “He’s earned the right to be our quarterback, as hard as it is for me to say,” Romo said of Prescott in what amounted to an official concession speech last month. “What is clear is that I was that kid once. ” When Romo was that kid, it was all so much fun. He sang Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’” at his locker, and he joked with the reporters who scribbled down his every word. Even when he was injured, he would brush off his physical problems because he was absolutely positive that he would come back, even better than ever. Most of the time, he was right. “When things don’t go your way,” he once told me, “you just have to come right back and say: ‘Let’s try this again. Let’s have some fun. ’” Romo doesn’t look as if he’s having any fun now. The black vinyl seat at his locker was empty when I visited Texas last week. Next to it was a pile of papers with information about the Giants, and how the Cowboys would match up. Romo had scribbled notes in the margins, knowing full well that it was unlikely that he would play. He doesn’t need to talk with reporters, and so, generally, he doesn’t. It’s a jarring change. When I covered the Cowboys for The Dallas Morning News in 2003, just after Romo was signed as a rookie free agent, I could always find him on the blue leather couches in the locker room, a motivational book in hand, the dimple on his left cheek showing because he was nearly always smiling. For three seasons, Romo sat and watched the Cowboys burn through quarterback after quarterback: Quincy Carter, Drew Henson, Vinny Testaverde, Drew Bledsoe. Romo, a friendly son of Wisconsin, seemed to know his time would come. And just like that, midway through the 2006 season, it did. He came in for Bledsoe against the Giants, and he never looked back. O. K. that’s an exaggeration. He’s probably looking back now. And who would blame him for being nostalgic? Now likely closer to his 40th birthday than he is to starting in a Super Bowl, he must wonder if he will ever take a snap for the Cowboys  —   for anyone  —   again. Others on the team must be wondering the same thing, though they won’t admit it. “I want to do what gives us the best chance to have Tony contribute to a championship,” the owner Jerry Jones said on his radio show last week. “Tony’s ready to go Tony’s not done,” said Scott Linehan, the Cowboys’ offensive coordinator. Tight end Jason Witten, Romo’s close friend and his favorite receiver, struggled to even consider the idea that Romo might never throw him another pass. He fidgeted as he considered his answer and admitted that he didn’t really want to give one. He and Romo were rookies together. They became the franchise players together. They even became fathers at about the same time. “We’ve kind of grown up together and went from being kids to being men at the same time,” Witten said. “I know that Tony’s always going to be the same guy, no matter what situation he’s dealing with, and I also believe he can still get it done on the field. ” He paused for a moment before adding, “But this game doesn’t slow down for anybody, and Tony understands that. ” Walking through the locker room in Frisco on Thursday, Romo looked less like an N. F. L. starter and more like someone who had just rolled out of bed. Tousled hair. Unshaven face. Baggy sweatpants. Head down and silent. Across the room, Prescott engaged a crowd of reporters. He is now the star of the show.",0
20706,20706,"As America Sleeps, Donald Trump Seethes on Twitter - The New York Times","Michael Barbaro, Maggie Haberman and Alan Rappeport","The tweets started around 3:20 a. m. on Friday. Inside Trump Tower, a restless figure stirred in the predawn darkness, nursing his grievances and grabbing a device that often lands him in hot water. On his Android phone, Donald J. Trump began to tap out bursts of digital fury: He mocked Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe and a popular Latin American actress, as a “con,” the “worst” and “disgusting. ” In a final flourish, before the sun came up, the Republican presidential nominee claimed  —   without offering any evidence  —   that she had appeared in a “sex tape. ” The tirade fit a pattern. It is when Mr. Trump is alone with his thoughts, and untethered from his campaign staff, that he has seemed to commit his most   acts. “There has always been this dangerous part of him that will go too far and do something that backfires,” said Michael D’Antonio, the author of “The Truth About Trump,” a new biography of the real estate mogul. “His worst impulses,” he added, “are  . ” Over the past few days, those instincts have been on vivid display. In quick succession, Mr. Trump has repeated his critique that Ms. Machado gained a “massive amount of weight” after she won the Miss Universe crown in 1996 suggested that former President Bill Clinton’s infidelities are fair game for campaign attacks and urged his followers to “check out” a sex tape that may not exist. (Ms. Machado appeared in a risqué scene on a reality television show, but   have discovered no sex tape.) The eruptions could further damage Mr. Trump’s reputation with women and Latino voters at a time when he can scarcely afford to alienate either group, five and a half weeks before Election Day. Yet for close students of Mr. Trump’s career and campaign, it all has a familiar ring. Over the years, he has issued a stream of needlessly cruel and seemingly    insults  —   both on and off social media  —   that have inflamed the public. He declared on Twitter that Kim Novak, a reclusive    actress at the time, “should sue her plastic surgeon,” sending her into hiding. He derided the appearance of a rival, Carly Fiorina, angering female voters by asking: “Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?” And he criticized the mother of a slain American soldier, musing that as a Muslim woman, she was not “allowed” to speak. Such fulminations have almost always arisen from Mr. Trump’s wounded pride, after he has been attacked or has suffered a setback. And they have frequently played out on Twitter, at hours of the day when much of America is asleep. The   tweets about Ms. Machado were a reminder, said the Republican strategist Charles Black, that Mr. Trump “cannot let something drop until he proves he’s right, and it’s beside the point who’s right. ” Around midnight one night during the primary campaign, he posted an unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz, the wife of a Republican rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Early one morning, he alleged a sexual affair between two   television anchors who had criticized him. Early one Saturday, he distributed an image of Mrs. Clinton, surrounded by falling cash and a   star that many said was a Star of David and was  . And at 11 one evening, he shared a digitally altered image of Jeb Bush appearing to pick his nose. “Late night   Donald is back at it!” an aide to Mr. Bush replied at the time. On Friday, Mr. Trump was at it again between 3:20 and 5:30 a. m. issuing a series of indignant messages that mocked Ms. Machado and Mrs. Clinton, who raised the experience of the former beauty queen to hurt Mr. Trump during the debate. Mrs. Clinton, he wrote, “was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an ‘angel’ without checking her past, which is terrible!” A few minutes later, Mr. Trump theorized  —   again, without offering any evidence  —   that Mrs. Clinton had helped Ms. Machado become a United States citizen so that the Democratic nominee could mention the beauty queen in the debate to hurt Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump, in an interview on Friday afternoon, said he remained proud of his tweets. “Why would I have regrets? I’m a very truthful person, and I’m telling the truth. Now people understand it. And before the tweets, people didn’t understand it. ” It is unusual for a major party presidential nominee to directly control any online communications, let alone issue provocative, unsubstantiated claims without the filter of a campaign aide. But Mr. Trump is fixated on Twitter. He has nearly 12 million followers and has reveled in watching his stray thoughts become viral sensations on the social media platform. He has been fond of quoting a fan on Twitter, who described him as “the Ernest Hemingway of a hundred and forty characters. ” So like a car careening down a highway with no guardrails, Mr. Trump on Friday sent out one message after another. His suggestion of a sex tape featuring Ms. Machado sent his most zealous followers hunting for images. A few of them posted pornographic images of women who they believe resembled Ms. Machado. Ms. Machado on Friday called Mr. Trump’s online assault “cheap lies with bad intentions” and said that she would not be intimidated. Aides to Mrs. Clinton, who have long warned of his reckless ways on Twitter, said Mr. Trump’s behavior had once again bolstered their argument that he is mentally unfit for the presidency. “I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him,” Mrs. Clinton said on Friday. “Really, who gets up at 3 o’clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe?” she asked. Many wondered aloud on Friday whether Mr. Trump’s erratic   behavior is the result of disorienting insomnia, since he regularly boasts of needing only a few hours of sleep. But Mr. Trump quickly rejected that theory. “For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o’clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. Not everyone in his life seems so sure. Asked this year which habit she wished her husband would quit, Melania Trump gave a   answer: tweeting.",0
20707,20707,"OPEC, Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",Karen Zraick and Sandra Stevenson,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1.   Donald Trump announced on Twitter that he would take steps to separate from his business empire. The Office of Government Ethics said only a divestiture of his financial stake in his real estate business would resolve ethical concerns about conflicts of interest. Mr Trump also unveiled his economic team of investment titans. His secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, above, promised sizable corporate tax cuts in an appearance on CNBC. Sarah Palin is being considered for Veterans Affairs. Next up: Rallies in states that were crucial to his victory, beginning in Cincinnati. One of the stops will be at a  plant in Indiana run by Carrier, which decided against moving about 1, 000 jobs to Mexico after pressure from Mr. Trump. ____ 2. Do we have to report everything Mr. Trump tweets? Typically,   hold news conferences after the election. Mr. Trump has not, instead exhibiting an unprecedented reliance on social media. Editors and reporters said they planned to apply the same news judgment to tweets they would to any statement by a powerful leader. But they acknowledged that the medium allows Mr. Trump to reduce complicated subjects to snappy and sometimes misleading slogans. ____ 3. Nancy Pelosi retained her post as the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, but about a third of House Democrats voted for her challenger, Tim Ryan, a    Ohioan from a   district. After a dismal Election Day for Democrats, the fight for the role had become a proxy battle for the future of the party. ____ 4. A Charlotte, N. C. police officer will not face charges in the fatal shooting in September of a black resident, Keith Lamont Scott, above. The killing set off days of unrest. Mr. Scott’s wife recorded the confrontation, in which she yells that he is unarmed. But prosecutors said Mr. Scott was, after all, carrying a handgun. ____ 5. OPEC agreed to cut oil production for the first time in eight years. But for the   deal to work,   member Russia must cooperate. While the announcement sent oil prices soaring, they’re nowhere near historic highs. Above right, the Saudi energy minister at the group’s meeting in Vienna. ____ 6. The chartered plane that crashed in Colombia, killing almost all aboard, including members of a Brazilian soccer team, may have run out of fuel. In a recording circulating on Colombian media, the pilot pleaded for immediate landing rights, telling an air traffic controller that the plane was “in total failure, total electrical failure, without fuel. ” Above, a tribute to the team at its stadium in Chapeco, Brazil. ____ 7. Drug regulators approved   clinical trials to study MDMA, the illegal party drug better known as Ecstasy, as treatment for   stress disorder. “It changed my life,” said the veteran above, who had PTSD after three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. “It allowed me to see my trauma without fear or hesitation and finally process things and move forward. ” ____ 8. Snapchat’s parent company, Snap, is headed for a blockbuster I. P. O. It has overtaken Twitter in terms of daily users, and its new gadget is selling fast: sunglasses, above, that record video clips. The service is still frequently dismissed by people over 25. If you are one of them, our tech writer says it’s time to reconsider. ___ 9. We asked five writers and showrunners who have worked on programs like “Homeland” and “Quantico” about whether TV can be fair to Muslims. The takeaways: There’s an oversize appetite for stories about terrorism, and not enough diversity in the industry. “When   are writing for some characters, it either becomes they’re terrorists or they’re so P. C. that they end up writing sanctified characters, who are so good and so ” said the actor Aasif Mandvi, formerly of “The Daily Show. ” ____ 10. Chronic insomniacs, take heart. New online programs that use cognitive behavior therapy helped more than half of the subjects in a study within weeks. ___ 11. Finally, British vegetarians are furious. The Bank of England confirmed that tallow, which is made from beef or mutton fat, was used in the more durable   bills it introduced recently. “Being forced to pay taxes to contribute to animal products is a breach of rights,” one vegan wrote on Twitter. “Shut. up. omnivores.

20710,20710,Sex Bombshell Exposed After Hillary Couldn’t Hide What She Did Back In 2011,Robert Rich,"Sex Bombshell Exposed After Hillary Couldn’t Hide What She Did Back In 2011 Posted on October 31, 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This 
Hillary Clinton is backpedaling these days, but her past isn’t making things any easier on her. In fact, it seems that her dirty deeds from 2011 just came to the surface in the form of a sex bombshell – and not even she could hide it forever. 
With the FBI reopening its investigation into Hillary’s emails and private server, on account of another case into Anthony Weiner’s sexting of an alleged minor, it seems that there are some startling details coming forward. Although we all know that Weiner is a long-time pervert and sexual predator, it looks like things have been going on for longer than we thought – and Hillary knew about it all along. Everyone who knew Anthony Weiner targeted underage girls back in 2011: John Podesta, Neera Tanden, and Hillary Clinton (left), and Jennifer Palmieri (right) 
According to Mail Online , Hillary’s camp knew that Weiner was talking to and sending sexually graphic images to an underage girl all the way back in 2011, yet they did nothing to stop him. In fact, Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign communications director in 2011, sent an email to John Podesta, now chair of Clinton’s presidential campaign, and Neera Tanden, another Clinton adviser, detailing Weiner’s predatory and criminal behavior. 
Married to Hillary’s current top aide, Huma Abedin, at the time, Weiner’s indiscretions were made public knowledge to Hillary’s camp and only met with a mere “oof” from Podesta. Further reports indicate that police were sent to the 17-year-old girl’s home at the time to interview both the child and her parents. Anthony Weiner and his sex pics 
Of course, as we all know now, Weiner has come under official investigation after sending lewd messages to a different 15-year-old girl more recently. However, one can only wonder if Weiner’s most recent victim could have been spared if his predatory behavior was addressed back in 2011 rather than swept under the rug. 
Although he’s been widely deemed the black sheep of the political realm, it certainly appears that his divorce and early resignation was the least of concern pertaining to the fallout of his behavior. Seeing how the most recent of Weiner’s consequences just slapped Hillary, it doesn’t take much to imagine the hell he’s living in right now. Anthony Weiner and steamy messages he sent to a woman other than his wife 
However, it is good to have these things out in the open as it helps show the true Hillary Clinton – the one she never wanted you to know about. There’s no question that Hillary would do whatever it took to remain in power, but this is just ridiculous. 
Because of her neglect and the blind eye turned by her staff, an underage girl was allowed to be victimized because the truth would have a negative effect on them. There really is no jail cell that’s suited for what Hillary deserves but she will most certainly have to answer for her misdeeds after she’s dead and gone from this earth – and suffering for an eternity sounds rather fitting for the vile things she’s done.",1

20712,20712,Foreign Policy Names Floated By Trump Transition Undermine Campaign Promises,Dan Wright,"President-elect Donald Trump ran a thoroughly anti-establishment campaign. Some of those in the establishment who felt his wrath were the neoconservatives and liberal interventionists, as Trump thoroughly tore apart the Iraq War and the belligerent rhetoric of both Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.
For the average voter, the message was clear: a vote for Trump was a vote against trying to remake the world in America’s image through force. 
Or was it? Because the nominees being floated so far for key positions in the incoming Trump Administration are completely at odds with a more realist and humble foreign policy.
One of the names being floated for secretary of state is former UN Ambassador John Bolton, a man so hawkish that even a Republican Senate would not confirm him for the post after his recess appointment by President George W. Bush. Part of the reason was Bolton was on record claiming, “ There is no such thing as the United Nations,” and fully endorsing unilateralism.
Bolton is a neocon through and through. If he runs the State Department, expect an aggressive US posture in the world.
Another one of Trump’s foreign policy advisors is former CIA Director James Woolsey. Woolsey is an arch-neocon who pushed some of the most weakly-sourced talking points in the run up to the Iraq War, including that Iraq was connected to the 9/11 attack. Unlike Trump, Woolsey does not believe the war was a mistake and defended the decisions as recently as 2015.
Bolton? Woolsey? Why does Trump want to bring in the architects of the Iraq War into his administration? 
While it is true no official nominations or appointments have been made, that these people are even being considered is arguably a betrayal of Trump’s campaign promise to change course on foreign policy. It also completely contradicts Trump’s famous line that the problem with US foreign policy is that it’s run by “stupid people.” 
Guess what Trump? John Bolton and James Woolsey are exactly the stupid people you were talking about.

20713,20713,"A Vegetable Tart, but Nothing Too Dainty - The New York Times",Melissa Clark,"Savory tarts can be dainty things, eaten on your finest china with a pinkie in the air. But not this one. Loaded with roasted vegetables and cheese on a   crust, it’s a hearty meal that you can eat out of hand, with your pinkie occupied by holding the slice. It’s gorgeous, too. With a mixture of velvety butternut squash, earthy mushrooms and sweet green leeks, this tart makes for an especially pretty yet satisfying vegetarian meal. The crust is made with yeast, which is what really makes this tart rustic, rather than refined. If working with yeast makes you nervous, this recipe is a good place to begin. The dough is so simple you can mix it by hand with a wooden spoon and then knead it for just a few minutes, until it starts to spring back when you pull it. It should be somewhat elastic but not bouncy. Think Silly Putty rather than Spaulding. Then set the dough aside to rise. The warmer your room, the less time it will take to double in bulk. In a cold room it could take two or three hours, whereas a warm room gets the job done in half that amount of time. Or let it rise in the fridge overnight. It’s a very adaptable recipe. The   flour in the dough gives it heft, along with a gentle nuttiness. I like either   or rye flour here, but you can substitute spelt or einkorn. Just be sure to use a flour with gluten in it. In this particular recipe,   flours (brown rice, millet, oat) won’t bake up as pleasingly chewy. I’ve topped the tart with mushrooms, leeks and winter squash, all roasted before they meet the crust. This is an important step. You want to roast the vegetables until they are almost, but not quite, caramelized. They should be pale golden at the edges and tender in the center when you pull them from the oven, but not thoroughly browned because they will continue to cook when you bake them on the crust. You can roast the vegetables up to eight hours in advance, but the tart itself is best made within an hour or two of serving. That’s when the crust is at its most crisp and the cheese still soft and oozing. That said, you can still enjoy the tart the next day, especially if you reheat it. Leftover and cold, eaten wrapped in a napkin on your way out the door, this robust tart can hold its own. Recipe: Roasted Mushroom and Butternut Squash Tart And to Drink . .. This savory tart presents a challenge. Mushrooms go beautifully with red wines, while leeks, squash and cheese all cry out for whites. Pick whichever you prefer, but avoid tannic reds and oaky whites. In reds, I would look for something fruity and balanced: Pinot noir would be great, as would Beaujolais, young Riojas and the more restrained American grenaches and carignans. You could try monastrells and other wines from southeastern Spain, and Valpolicellas from Italy. Among whites, I would look at dry chenin blancs from the Loire Valley, unoaked chardonnays and possibly rieslings from Austria or Alsace. A dry sparkling wine would also be excellent. ERIC ASIMOV",0

A Houthi rebel man holds a US-made cluster bomb fragment after a Saudi-led airstrike in Yemen’s capital, Monday, April 20, 2015. (AP Photo/Hani Mohammed) 
After a solid 19 months of endorsing the Saudi war in Yemen, selling the Saudis massive amounts of arms, and refueling Saudi bombers over Yemen’s airspace, the Obama Administration today called on the Saudis to halt airstrikes against Yemen, and accept that there is no military solution. 
A top Human Rights Watch director noted that the call would’ve carried a lot more weight if the US wasn’t providing the bombs the Saudis are dropping on Yemen in the first place, though former US officials say its almost certain this won’t include any dial back in US arms sales. 
The call likely reflects the UN’s peace plan being presented to both sides and immediately rejected by the pro-Saudi officials. Huge civilian death tolls in recent Saudi attacks have added up to make the US a bit more gunshy than usual about supporting the Saudi war publicly. 
At the same time, the US “opposition” to the air war is slim indeed, with the US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, insisting even in the announcement of their opposition to further strikes that the US supports Saudi Arabia’s right to “self-defense,” which in this case included an outright invasion of a neighboring country. 
The US has insisted Saudi aid is “under review” since a recent attack on a funeral. That said, there is no sign that any real changes in US policy were made, and the expectation is that, as always, US interest in growing arms exports will win out.",1

As Iraqi forces continue to struggle to get closer to the ISIS city of Mosul during the ongoing invasion, a US friendly fire incident has been reported in the town of Tal-Kayf, a town which fell quite some time ago and in which recent fighting hadn’t been reported. 
According to Iraqi military officials, the US airstrikes against the town killed at least four Iraqi soldiers and wounded nine others . The details are still scant on what happened, and the US has yet to comment on the incident at all. 
Iraqi officials are chalking it up as a mistake, but it is unclear why the town would be struck by US planes in the first place, as the Iraqi troops had been there for almost a week and there did not appear to be ISIS forces in the immediate vicinity. 
Iraqi forces confirmed the incident amid an announcement of more villages captured in the area west of Mosul. Many of the villages more than 5 km from the city have already fallen, and ISIS appears to be only sparsely defending those that remain, with the vast majority of their fighters hunkered down in Mosul itself, prepared for a major battle.

20718,20718,This Is The Best Picture In Human History | Daily Wire,nan,"This Is The Best Picture In Human History By: November 10, 2016 
This is the best picture in human history. 
It is the best picture in human history because it tells the entire tale of both parties, the republic, and why we are where we are. 
On the left side of this picture, we have Donald Trump – a reality television star and lifelong vulgarian, the new president-elect of the United States. He points his fingers and smiles that Apprentice smile as he makes a point. 
On the right side of this picture, we have Barack Obama – a man who considered himself a paragon of dignity and rectitude, who thought of himself as a transformative figure and an intellectual giant. He sits next to the man who maintained for years that his birth certificate was a fraud, the man who has the opportunity to undo virtually his entire agenda within the first month of his assumption of office. And Obama, rightly, looks like a man with a pole shoved so far up his rectum that the glint of steel is visible behind his eyes. 
Behind Obama sits a bust of Abraham Lincoln, his eyes downcast, mourning for his country. 
Yep. 
Greatest picture ever. 
This is a picture of justice done and karma ascendant. Barack Obama’s image of himself is not accurate – to Americans, Obama is a reality TV show star. He transformed the presidency from a dignified office into a selfie-stick, celebrity-ridden sinkhole of Hollywood glitterati, hobnobbing with Glozell and Macklemore, cracking wise about the presidency with Jimmy Kimmel before saying that a reality star like Trump could never be president. 
This picture looks like the chickens coming home to roost, as Obama’s former pastor might put it. 
And then there’s Lincoln. 
Lincoln, who gave his life and spent his presidency building the groundwork for racial toleration, mourning behind Barack Obama, who has spent his presidency polarizing for electoral gain. 
Lincoln, who represented wisdom, mourning behind a clown as the clown gestures to the assembled crowd. Given Republicans’ domination of the Senate and the Congress, I have hopes for Trump’s presidency – I hope he keeps his promises and that he becomes a better man and a wonderful president, and believe he has every obligation to fulfill his conservative campaign promises – but Trump occupying Lincoln’s office is, at best, a jarring visual. 
That’s the picture. ",1
20719,20719,Experts: Obama Helped Trump With Illegal Database,dailouk,"Home | World | Experts: Obama Helped Trump With Illegal Database Experts: Obama Helped Trump With Illegal Database By Carlos Mohón 15/11/2016 09:43:43 
ARIZONA – USA – As the Obama administration encouraged illegal immigrants to come over the border, Donald Trump wants to stop this, and send them back. 

Thanks to Obama’s initiative to acquire a database of illegal immigrants in America, and a pledge of amnesty , which allowed many to sign up, Donald Trump now has a complete list of people to be deported from America. 
Every year many people try to gain entry into the United States utilising legal channels of entry, and millions are denied. It is therefore wrong that many others who wish to come to America can just walk across a border, and were encouraged to do so under the Obama administration. 
Trump has already outlined a plan to deport 2-3 million illegals who arrived illegally from South American countries and who pose a serious danger to the populace. The deportation of illegals with criminal records and links to gangs will be a first step, however there are still approximately 12 million known illegal aliens residing within the U.S.’s border, and these will be rounded up and deported in the next year or so. 
The logistics of rounding up these people and putting them on secure buses back to the border will be enormous. Some advisers are saying that there will be elements who try and flee from immigration control officers, however, they will have no place to go. They will not be able to work, or rent out a place to sleep, once they are caught they too will be rounded up and thrown out of the country. 
Many illegal immigrants are now going underground or fleeing back across the border, so Trump has a big job in front of him, that is if he does not go back on his word. Share on :",1

20721,20721,Sperm Banks Accused of Losing Samples and Lying About Donors - The New York Times,Tamar Lewin,"MONTECITO, Calif.  —   Even as she mourned the death of her    husband from a rare genetic disorder, Sarah Robertson was comforted by knowing that six vials of his sperm were safely stored at the Reproductive Fertility Center  —   in Tank B, Canister 5, Cane G, Position 6, Color Blue  —   waiting until she was ready to have the baby they had both longed for. But 10 years later, when she was ready to use the sperm from her husband, Aaron, she got devastating news. All six vials were missing. “I’d been completely focused on having something of Aaron’s live on, and now there was nothing,” said Ms. Robertson in an interview at her  ’ home in Montecito. Now she and her   are suing the Los Angeles clinic, and its owner, Dr. Peyman Saadat, accusing them of negligence, fraud, breach of contract and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The suit, filed in May, also says the clinic misappropriated Mr. Robertson’s sperm  —   which had a 50 percent chance of carrying Marfan syndrome, the disorder that killed him  —   and used it to supply other patients who would not know to undergo testing to ensure their babies did not inherit the disorder. The Robertsons’ case is part of a new wave of lawsuits against sperm banks, highlighting claims of deception and negligence, and adding an array of challenges beyond the longstanding issue of undetected genetic problems. Dr. Saadat declined to be interviewed, but denied the accusations in a statement. Frozen sperm has become a major industry, dominated by a few large sperm banks, but with smaller stocks of sperm maintained at hundreds of   centers nationwide. The Food and Drug Administration requires that donor sperm be tested for infectious diseases. Beyond that, sperm banks are lightly regulated. Several states require health department licensing of the labs, but only New York conducts routine inspections. Some of the new cases accuse sperm banks of careless   or mishandling or misappropriation of sperm banked for a client’s personal use. Others say the banks use hyped, misleading descriptions to market their donors. Several cases accuse a Georgia facility of marketing sperm as belonging to a neuroscientist with a   I. Q. who turned out to be a schizophrenic felon, and who has fathered at least 36 children. “Even in New York, when they inspect, they’re looking at hygienic conditions not ” said Arthur Caplan, a bioethics professor at New York University. “Nobody confirms that you have what you say you have. ” “It’s absurd that we have these materials so valuable that people pay to store them, but we run it like a   grocery,” he continued. “Cryopreservation has historically operated in a casual   environment, where people were just supposed to trust. ” Sperm banks are not required to verify the information provided by donors, and lawyers familiar with the industry say many do not. They set their own limits on how many children a donor can sire, but unless the mothers voluntarily report the births, they may not know how many   are out there. Some, including the two largest, California Cryobank in Los Angeles and Fairfax Cryobank, headquartered in Virginia, test for many genetic conditions, while others test for very few. So it is    —   for people banking their own sperm for personal use after cancer treatment, and for those relying on a sperm bank’s description of an anonymous donor. Sean Tipton, a spokesman for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, said his group did not see a need for further regulation and believed that the industry was generally reliable. “All indications are that sperm donation has been a terrific way to help people start a family even if, as with anything that involves humans, there are mistakes and some    actors,” he said. In the past, few problems with sperm came to light, because most families were unwilling to discuss such an intimate matter in public. But that is changing, with a demographic shift in sperm buyers. Once, sperm banks mostly served heterosexual married couples in which the husband had a fertility problem, but today about   of the buyers are either lesbian couples and single women, who are more open about their children’s origins. With genetic testing widely available and relatively cheap, the concept of donor anonymity is increasingly open to question. “I can personally attest that there are more cases than you ever hear about, but almost all settle before they get to court,” said Andrew Vorzimer, a California fertility lawyer representing the Robertsons. Wendy Kramer,   of the Donor Sibling Registry, which helps families connect with others who used the same donor, says she hears a steady stream of problems, including lost records and genetic issues reported to the sperm bank but never shared with all the donor’s offspring. “People think it’s a medical industry, it must be regulated and trustworthy, but it’s just sperm sellers,” said Ms. Kramer, whose registry, founded in 2000, has more than 50, 000 members, and has connected more than 13, 000 relatives. “They can say whatever they want. ” In Florida, California, Canada and England, lawsuits are pending against Xytex, the Georgia facility that sold sperm from Donor 9623, James Christian Aggeles. The lawsuit claims the sperm bank described Mr. Aggeles as a   neuroscientist with bachelor’s and master’s degrees who was pursuing a Ph. D. in neuroscience engineering. Instead, according to court papers, Mr. Aggeles did not have a college degree, had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and had an arrest record that included burglary. Many of the families that used Mr. Aggeles’s sperm had already found each other before Xytex sent an email that accidentally included his email address, prompting intense internet sleuthing by the mothers to discover his identity. “We found out a lot of things about him from public information,” said Angie Collins, an Ontario woman with a    son fathered by Mr. Aggeles. “Xytex could have done that, too, if they’d wanted to. I think sperm banks should be required to get the donor’s medical records, and run a criminal background check. ” Xytex would not discuss the case but Ted Lavender, a lawyer for the company, said in a statement that Xytex “complies with all industry standards. ” Jennifer Cramblett, a white Ohio mother who mistakenly got sperm from a black donor, is suing the Midwest Sperm Bank in Downers Grove, Ill. on the grounds of negligence. She and her partner had been sent vials from Donor 330, an   donor, rather than Donor 380, the white donor they had chosen, according to her lawsuit. No one at the Midwest Sperm Bank would discuss the case. Dr. Saadat, who was sued by Ms. Robertson, also faces a suit by Justin Hollman, a California man who froze five vials of his sperm before undergoing chemotherapy for testicular cancer at age 20. Years later, Mr. Hollman wanted his sperm transferred to his wife’s fertility doctor. When he was presented with paperwork, his lawsuit says, he noticed that it authorized the destruction of his sperm instead of the transfer. After refusing to sign, the court papers say, Mr. Hollman got a call from Dr. Saadat later that day telling him the samples had been destroyed as a result of “human error. ” Mr. Hollman declined to discuss the case, and repeated calls to Dr. Saadat’s center and to his lawyers were not returned. The Robertsons’ lawsuit also claims there was deception by the center, which on different occasions said the sperm either had never been stored there or had been destroyed in a fire. When Ms. Robertson initially asked for the sperm, according to court papers, the center told her that five of the six vials were missing. The complaint went on to say that Dr. Saadat urged her to try to get pregnant with the sixth vial, but the clinic’s manager later emailed that the sixth vial, too, was gone. “When I got that email, I stood up and screamed,” said Ms. Robertson, who is a nurse practitioner. The Robertsons still wonder what sperm Dr. Saadat would have used if Ms. Robertson had agreed to use the purported last vial to get pregnant. “Was he just going to take someone’s sample at random?” Ms. Robertson asked. “It’s terrifying to imagine a health care business being operated so recklessly. ”",0
20722,20722,Comment on Obamacare Architect Gruber Demands “Larger Mandate Penalty” by marlene,marlene,"Posted on October 27, 2016 by Paul Joseph Watson Bureaucrat who said “stupidity” of Americans helped get law passed doubles down 
Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber – the bureaucrat who once bragged that the “stupidity” of the American people was crucial for passing the health care law in the first place – told CNN that the “fix” for Obamacare was to impose a “larger mandate penalty”. CNN’s CAROL COSTELLO: “So let’s talk about how exactly you can fix Obamacare. I just need you to be specific because I think people really want answers. So Hillary Clinton says she can fix Obamacare. So what would one fix that would drive premiums down?” JONATHAN GRUBER: “Look, once again, there’s no sense it has to be fixed. The law is working as designed. However, it could work better. And I think, probably the most important things experts would agree on is we need a larger mandate penalty“… Gruber’s arrogance is incredible. Even after the Obama administration acknowledged that premiums are set to skyrocket next year, Gruber thinks that the answer is to financially punish Americans to an even greater degree. Gruber is essentially admitting that Obamacare is designed to make Americans destitute. “ObamaCare was never designed *not* to overwhelm you with the shifting of massive costs. ObamaCare was designed to crush you in costs,” points out the Conservative Treehouse blog . His comments shouldn’t come as much of a surprise given what Gruber thinks of the American people. A series of videos that emerged in 2014 featured Gruber admitting that Obamacare was deceptively crafted in order to fool “stupid” Americans into not realizing that it would mean massive price hikes and that the law’s “lack of transparency (was) a huge political advantage” in selling it.",1
20723,20723,Wall Street Journal: Democrats Trying to Squelch Susan Rice Unmasking Story - Breitbart,Kristina Wong,"The Wall Street Journal in an editorial over the weekend said Democrats are trying to squelch the story of Susan Rice’s unmasking of Trump campaign officials, and the House and Senate Intelligence committees should investigate the former national security adviser. [“The House and Senate Intelligence committees should investigate what she did and why,” the Wall Street Journal argued in an April 28 piece.  Last month, blogger Mike Cernovich and other news outlets reported that Rice had unmasked, or identified the names, of Trump campaign officials caught up during surveillance of a foreign target. The piece said Democrats raised a fuss in 2005 over   Bush official John Bolton doing the same thing but with far more justification, due to the job he held, but are now “going all in to squelch” the story. “Then Senators Joe Biden and Chris Dodd kicked up a fuss that, as Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Mr. Bolton had 10 times over four years asked for the names of American officials who were swept up in National Security Agency monitoring. ” “Democrats and their press allies are going all in to squelch the Susan Rice ‘unmasking’ story, insisting that the decision by Barack Obama’s national security adviser to seek the name of at least one Trump campaign official was routine and no big deal,” it said. For example, it said, “House Intelligence Committee Democrat Adam Schiff released a tutorial on why unmasking is ‘lawful.’ ‘Susan Rice Did Nothing Wrong,’ said an NBC headline, quoting no one on the record. ” The Wall Street Journal editorial also pointed out that while Rice and Democrats have defended her actions as “not uncommon,” Democrats and the media in 2005 characterized it as unusual. At that time, Dodd claimed unmasking was “rarely requested” and “infrequently” by “political appointees such as Mr. Bolton. ” The New York Times also reported that requests to unmask “are not common, particularly from policy makers. ” The editorial also argued that there was no apparent reason for Rice to have requested the unmasking of Trump campaign officials’ names, contrary to her explanations. “Ms. Rice had no direct intelligence duties in her NSC post, and no Democrat has provided a valid reason that Ms. Rice might have needed to unmask anyone associated with the Trump presidential campaign,” the editorial said. Rice has denied doing anything “untoward” with the intelligence she received, as did Bolton. But Democrats had drawn up a list of 36 individuals that he clashed with and called on National Intelligence Director John Negroponte to rule out they were the target of Bolton’s unmasking. And while House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes ( ) has stepped aside from his committee’s Russia probe after complaints from   activist groups that he discussed unmasking in public, Democrats in 2005 “couldn’t stop talking to the press,” the piece said. The piece also pointed out that names unmasked by Bolton have still never made it out to the public, in contrast with the illegal leaking in February of phone conversations held by former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. “Twelve years on, not one of the 10 individuals unmasked by Mr. Bolton has had his or her identity leaked. By contrast, the Washington Post reports that no fewer than nine Obama appointees or career officials leaked or confirmed the identity and conversations of unmasked former Trump adviser Michael Flynn. “If John Bolton’s unmasking was questionable, then Mrs. Rice’s was more so. The House and Senate Intelligence committees should investigate what she did and why. ” Rice is expected to be among witnesses asked by the House intelligence committee to testify in its ongoing probe of Russian interference in the elections.",0
20724,20724,Lessons in the Delicate Art of Confronting Offensive Speech - The New York Times,Benedict Carey and Jan Hoffman,"What if Billy Bush had just changed the subject? As unlikely as that may sound to anyone who has heard the infamous 2005 tape of Donald J. Trump boasting about sexually accosting women to the chuckling encouragement of Mr. Bush, an “Access Hollywood” host at the time, it just might have stifled the celebrity billionaire. A body of psychological research shows that even mild pushback against offensive remarks can have an instant effect  —   as difficult as that can be, especially with a boss, a friend or a celebrity. It is research worth considering in a political season when ethnic, racist and sexual slurs, not to mention general insults, seem to have become part of everyday chatter. Polls show that people are increasingly unhappy with the tenor of the national debate but unsure what to do about the decline in civility. Researchers have detailed the difficulty of confronting prejudice, but they have also found that even the politest of objections  —   or subtle corrections to loaded words  —   can almost instantly curb a speaker’s behavior. With a clearer understanding of the dynamics of such confrontation, psychologists say, people can develop tactics that can shut down the unsavory talk without ruining relationships, even when the offender has more status or power: a fraternity president, say, or a team captain or employer. The alternative is passive complicity, psychologists say. “When we hear this egregious, uncomfortable talk and we don’t speak up, what’s actually happening is that the person speaking is getting a green light,” said Sharyn J. Potter,   of the Prevention Innovations Research Center, at the University of New Hampshire. “It encourages them. ” It hardly takes a psychologist to explain the difficulty inherent in any such confrontation. “Simply saying, ‘I don’t appreciate that comment,’ or ‘That’s not cool’  —   well, people aren’t going to like you very much after that,” said Linda Tropp, a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. “But they do get defensive, and change their behavior quickly. ” It is important to realize that you don’t have to make a dramatic, principled stand. “We don’t want bystanders to think they have to fly in with their Superman cape,” said Dr. Potter, who is also an associate professor of sociology. There are many approaches people can use to stop talk they find noxious, say experts in what is known as bystander education. Among them: distraction, such as abruptly changing the subject. “Even in the locker room, guys can change the conversation, they can spray people with water, or crank up the music,” Dr. Potter said. Rather than calling out the speaker and shaming him or her publicly, which can carry the risk of retaliation, you could make it about you. “You could say: ‘This is bothering me. One of my good friends was raped. ’” Dr. Potter said. “If you put it on yourself, that might feel safer. ” Or you can try humor. Gail Stern, an educator and a   of Catharsis Productions, which gives sexual violence prevention training on college campuses and in the military, said that one deft approach might be to assume that the speaker is being outrageous on purpose, and to respond with something like this: “I love satire. It’s so weird that people believe that for real and it’s so cool you called that out. ” She calls that tactic “verbal aikido,” after the Japanese martial art whose practitioners defend themselves by redirecting an opponent’s attack. An essential component of bystander intervention training is to get participants to imagine their own responses to scenarios. The goal is to get people to arm themselves with approaches that feel natural and innate, rather than outfitting them with model scripts. “If you have a plan in your head, then you can use it,” Dr. Potter said. Psychologists who study the effects of such confrontation divide offensive behavior into two loose categories. One includes strangers acting out  —   a mother who slaps a toddler, a boy who punches his girlfriend  —   and bystanders, when they react, tend to do so viscerally and quickly. The other category includes offensive jokes or references among people who know one another, like friends or  . In those cases, there are more gray areas, as well as personality factors to consider and often a relationship at stake. Objections, if they come, often take a little longer than bystander intervention does. Deborah Cameron, a professor of language and communication at the University of Oxford, said that sexual banter often takes place among men who are friends, and that “the function of it is to promote bonding. ” Men may feel that if they challenge conversation they find tasteless, or simply don’t join in, “they’re spoiling the mood at a minimum and possibly putting their relationship to the group at risk,” she said. And sometimes they worry that “it will raise doubts about their masculinity or heterosexuality,” or that they will become targets of bullying, said Ms. Cameron, author of “The Myth of Mars and Venus: Do Men and Women Really Speak Different Languages?” Yet subtle objections can stop people in midsentence, in some cases prompting later reflection, psychologists have found. In one type of experiment, for example, study participants guess the occupations of people based on a photograph and limited information, like “spends most of his days walking the streets” or “does regular housework. ” Most of these profiles are ethnically neutral. But some are ringers. The photo of a black man who “walks the streets” often prompts guesses of “homeless” rather than mail carrier and a black woman who depends on money from the government gets identified as a welfare mom instead of a government employee or a student with loans. Then the researchers, under the guise of fellow participants, push back. “We confront them in a variety of ways, sometimes harshly  —   ‘That’s racist!’  —   and sometimes much less so, appealing to equality: ‘Shouldn’t everyone be treated the same? ’” said Alexander Czopp, director of the Center for   Research at Western Washington University. “Depending on how the confrontation is done, the participants might show different levels of defensiveness and anger right away but they usually show less   attitudes on tests we do later. ” David Fleischer, director of the Los Angeles LGBT Center’s Leadership Lab, often sends gay and transgender people into socially conservative districts to do    canvassing. “We have to handle these situations all the time,” said Mr. Fleischer, now canvassing in Cleveland. “We are seeking out people who are prejudiced, and they’re using offensive language. And if you correct that language, just use different words yourself, and your tone and demeanor are kind, people are very responsive, and you don’t have to get into a screaming match. ” In a recent study, Mr. Fleischer and other researchers found that this kind of canvassing can soften the views of some 10 percent of voters  —   a large shift when it comes to political behavior, and one that has prompted wider training in such cordial, respectful “correcting” of language. Of course, most people never get any training they make judgments on the fly, about costs, tactics and personal integrity. And some are more likely to speak up than others, new research suggests. Aneeta Rattan, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the London Business School and Carol Dweck of Stanford found in a recent study that people who are optimistic and believe that others can change  —   that a bigot, with time, can change stripes  —   are more likely than the pessimists to say something. “In that sense,” Dr. Rattan said, “this work suggests that your belief system about others can either be a barrier or a staircase where you can take that first step  —   even if it’s just saying, ‘I disagree. ’”",0
20725,20725,For our freedom and yours,Kaitlyn Stegall,"November 4, 2016 For our freedom and yours 
IF EUROPEAN history once seemed to have arrived at its terminus in 1989, it has sped off in a new direction in Poland. After winning the country’s first post-1989 outright majority in elections one year ago, the populist Law and Justice party (PiS) immediately set about undermining independent checks on its power, from the constitutional court to public media. Such antics would disqualify an aspirant from membership of the European Union, but it is harder to punish miscreants once they are inside. Surrounded by problems outside its borders, from Russia to Turkey to Libya, the EU now confronts a particularly chewy one within. 
Outsiders sometimes lump Poland’s government in with the other populists making the running in much of western Europe. But while it shares their hostility to outsiders and taste for economic statism, PiS is a very Polish phenomenon. Its chairman, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who runs the country from the party’s headquarters (the prime minister, Beata Szydlo, is a cipher who does her leader’s bidding), is fixed on completing what he considers an unfinished revolution. Mr Kaczynski believes the Polish state was captured by a cosy, treacherous elite after 1989, with the connivance of the EU. His aim is to overturn and replace it.",1
20726,20726,Dustin Johnson Withdraws From the Masters With a Back Injury - The New York Times,Bill Pennington and Karen Crouse,"AUGUSTA, Ga.  —   The last player to win the Masters while ranked No. 1 in the world was Tiger Woods in 2005. That streak is safe for at least another year after Dustin Johnson withdrew on Thursday because of a lower back injury he sustained in a fall down the stairs of his rental home near the course on Wednesday afternoon. Minutes before he was expected on the first tee to begin his first round, he was still telling fellow competitors he was going to play. Or at least try. “Standing next to the practice putting green, I still was expecting to give it go,” Johnson said after withdrawing. “But even on the putting green, I was taking a few easy swings and my back was so tight. “I was only swinging 80 percent and I couldn’t get through the ball all the way. The backswing was fine but at impact and moving through, it hurt. I knew I wasn’t going to be able to compete. It’s terribly disappointing” On a windy day, Charley Hoffman used nine birdies to surge to the top of the leader board with a    65. He has a   lead over William McGirt, who is playing his first Masters at age 37. Lee Westwood is at   and Phil Mickelson, Sergio Garcia and Justin Rose are part of an   group that is  . Johnson had an extended   session before his tee time just after 2 p. m. He hit dozens of balls on the practice range but also took numerous breaks to go inside at the Augusta National Golf Club to have work done on his back. Nonetheless, about five minutes before his tee time, he began walking toward the first tee and practice putting green. “It’s really too bad  —   it feels like in two days I’ll be fine,” Johnson said, standing alongside the first tee after his withdrawal. Johnson offered a few more details about the mishap at his rented home in the Augusta area. He said his son, Tatum, was on his way back from day care, and he was going to move the car. “I slipped down the stairs, and there were only three stairs,” Johnson said. “It would have been better if it was a full staircase because I might have slid more. Instead, I just kind of stopped and hit. ” He landed on his elbow and lower back. He said the elbow was swollen but did not inhibit his swing. His back remained a problem even after he had medical personnel treat it for hours on Wednesday night. “I was up all night and didn’t really sleep,” said Johnson, last year’s United States Open champion. “It got better, but not really better enough. ” Before the fall, Johnson’s coach, Butch Harmon, who is doing commentary for   Sky Sports, suggested on the air that this Masters was Johnson’s to lose. “He’s probably playing the best he has ever played in his life,” Harmon said. “He absolutely loves this place and finished fourth here last year so has to be the   favorite. But that means nothing once Thursday starts. ” Johnson, 32, who supplanted Jason Day at No. 1 in February, arrived here with victories in his last three starts. He was the pretournament consensus favorite to become the first player since Jimmy Demaret in 1940 to make the Masters his fourth consecutive P. G. A. Tour win. On Tuesday, Johnson was asked about going into the Masters as the favorite. His response foreshadowed this unexpected turn of events. “I’ve got a lot of confidence in my game right now, especially with the way I’ve been playing the last few tournaments,” he said. “But, you know, anything can happen. ” This is the second time in the past six years that an injury kept Johnson from competing in the Masters, which is about a   drive from Columbia, S. C. where he was born. In 2012, Johnson withdrew two days before the first round with a back injury, which he said he got from lifting a Jet Ski. Fred Couples, whose World Golf Hall of Fame career has been disrupted by chronic back issues, said he was disappointed to hear that Johnson hadn’t been able to start. “It’s a bummer,” he said, adding, “But I didn’t fall down any stairs. Maybe that would have helped my back. ” Follow the Masters leader board here. ",0
20727,20727,"DHS Officers Humiliate Judges by Enforcing Immigration Laws, Declares Judge - Breitbart",Neil Munro,"Judges are humiliated and dehumanized whenever they must enforce the nation’s immigration laws, according to a senior judge on the   Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. [The judge’s cry of outrage came when he could not block the orderly repatriation of an illegal immigrant who has two drunk driving convictions, plus a U. S. wife and three children.   “We are unable to prevent [Andres] Magana Ortiz’s removal, yet it is contrary to the values of this nation and its legal system,” complained Judge Stephen Reinhardt, who wishes to extend citizens’ rights to illegal foreign migrants. He said:  We are compelled to deny Mr. Magana Ortiz’s request for a stay of removal because we do not have the authority to grant it. We are not, however, compelled to find the government’s action in this case fair or just.   …      The government’s decision to remove Magana Ortiz diminishes not only our country but our courts, which are supposedly dedicated to the pursuit of justice. Magana Ortiz and his family are in truth not the only victims. Among the others are judges who, forced to participate in such inhumane acts, suffer a loss of dignity and humanity as well. I concur as a judge, but as a citizen I do not. The judge, who was appointed  —   not elected  —   in 1980 and is married to a former top leader in the ACLU, also lamented the authority of ordinary DHS agents to enforce the law despite protests from     “civil rights” lawyers: On January 25, 2017, the President [Donald Trump] signed a series of executive orders dismantling the system of priorities that had previously guided Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol in determining whom to deport. The orders also gave far greater authority to individual agents and officers, who are now removing   simply because they are here illegally, regardless of whether they have committed any offense. In light of the breadth of these orders and the lack of any apparent limit on agents’ discretion, the undocumented must now choose between going to work, school, hospitals, and even court, and the risk of being seized.  In contrast, the new Supreme Court Justice appointed by Trump, Neil Gorsuch, has a more humble vision of his job as a judicial referee, saying in a 2013 award ceremony that: As my daughters remind me, donning a [judicial] robe doesn’t make me any smarter   …     It serves as a reminder of what’s expected of us —  what [Irish philosopher Edmund] Burke called the “cold neutrality of an impartial judge. ” It serves, too, as a reminder of the relatively modest station we’re meant to occupy in a democratic society. In other places, judges wear scarlet and ermine. Here, we’re told to buy our own plain black robes  —   and I can attest the standard choir outfit at the local uniform supply store is a good deal. Ours is a judiciary of honest black polyester. The judges on Reinhardt’s Ninth Circuit are expected to release soon a decision blocking Trump’s Executive Orders limiting the entry of people from six   Muslim countries. The decision is based on a Hawaiian case, in which an   Islamic cleric claimed his constitutional rights were infringed by Trump’s efforts to reduce Islamic jihad in the United States. The court’s decision may have been delayed by the   bloody attacks in Manchester and London, at least one of which was conducted by the sons of Muslim refugees and migrants from Libya.  Reinhardt’s intemperate language, said Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge, suggests that the court’s decisions are political biased. “There is no ‘cold neutrality’ in the Ninth Circuit’s ruling,” Arthur wrote about the court’s preliminary ruling in the Hawaii case. “It is personal, visceral, and vindictive. ” ",0
20728,20728,Trump warns of World War III if Clinton is elected,nan,"Email Donald Trump warned in an interview Tuesday that Hillary Clinton's policies as president to address the Syrian conflict would lead to World War III, arguing the Democratic nominee would draw the US into armed confrontation with Russia, Syria and Iran. ""What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,"" Trump told Reuters on Tuesday morning at his resort in Doral, Florida. ""You're going to end up in World War III over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton."" The Republican nominee, who has called for a rapprochement with Russia in order to jointly combat ISIS, argued that his Democratic rival's calls for taking a more aggressive posture in Syria to bring the conflict there to an end and combat ISIS will only draw the US into a larger war. Trump's remarks come as he trails Clinton in most national and key battleground state polls just two weeks from Election Day. ""You're not fighting Syria anymore, you're fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,"" he said. Trump: I'd 'love' to fight Biden Trump has not laid out a clear strategy for combating ISIS or addressing the globally destabilizing conflict in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions more to flee their homes. He has suggested the US should allow ISIS, anti-government rebels and the Syrian government to fight it out and more recently has focused on joining forces with Russia -- which has aided the Syrian regime in the bombing of civilians and US-allied rebels -- to combat ISIS. ""Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIS,"" Trump told Reuters of the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom US officials have argued must step down. Clinton has called for establishing a no-fly zone over Syria to help bring the five-year civil war to an end, a proposal top Republicans in Congress have championed, which President Barack Obama and others have opposed due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia. A US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down a Russian jet should it enter Syrian airspace. Clinton addressed those concerns in the final presidential debate, arguing that it would ""save lives and hasten the end of the conflict,"" while cautioning that ""this would not be done just on the first day."" ""This would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground,"" Clinton said during the debate earlier this month. ""I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and Syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria. It would help us in the fight against ISIS."" Trump has additionally called for establishing safe zones in Syria to protect civilians -- as has Clinton -- which could also put the US in conflict with the Syrian government or Russia should they oppose the policy. The Clinton campaign later Tuesday pushed back against Trump's rhetoric. ""National security experts on both sides of the aisle have denounced Donald Trump as dangerously ill-prepared and temperamentally unfit to serve as commander-in-chief,"" Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said. ""Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria. Moreover, this incendiary attack is aimed at a policy that his own running mate, Mike Pence, strongly supports."" Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead While Clinton has accused Trump of being Putin's ""puppet,"" Trump knocked Clinton for her criticism of the Russian strongman, asking, ""How she is going to go back and negotiate with this man who she has made to be so evil."" And just two days after he tied the successful enactment of his agenda as president to the election of Republican majorities in Congress, Trump also returned to his more typical complaints of a lack of Republican unity weighing down his candidacy. ""If we had party unity, we couldn't lose this election to Hillary Clinton,"" he told Reuters. That complaint didn't put Trump in more of a bipartisan mood, though, as the Republican nominee also told Reuters he would not consider putting any Democrats in his cabinet -- a departure from recent presidents, who have sought to post at least one member of their rival party in a top administration post.",1
20729,20729,Shock Video: Gunman Ambushes Police Inside Arizona Walmart,Warner Todd Huston,"Shocking surveillance video of two police officers ambushed by a gunman inside an Arizona Walmart has been release. It demonstrates how officers barely escaped death, yet stopped the assailant. [The   video shows Chandler officers Joshua Pueblo and Daniel Colwell casually walking into a Walmart after being called about a suspicious person who was trespassing. Without warning, the suspect, who was lurking near the   McDonald’s counter, opened fire, striking both officers, according to the Daily Mail.  The suspect, later identified as Mitchell Oakley, is seen running past the officers to escape the store, but drops his gun and then Officer Colwell shoots him.  In the video, Officer Pueblo is seen hitting the ground immediately after being shot in the face, while officer Colwell, who was shot twice at close range, is seen diving across the entryway, drawing his service weapon, and returning fire as the suspect runs by. After the suspect drops his firearm as he exits the store, Officer Colwell’s additional shots fell him as he scrambles back to retrieve his gun. Chandler police spokesman Seth Tyler said that the incident “sounds like an ambush to me. ” Officer Pueblo is on medical leave recovering from wounds to the face and arm, but officer Colwell was able to return to duty, presumably because his   vest absorbed the blows he received from the   killer’s firearm. Customers were shocked and badly frightened by the sudden storm of lead flying around the store. Walmart employees reported that customers were rounded up and led to the opposite side of the store for safety as police investigated the scene of the attack.  This is not the only recent shooting in an Arizona Walmart. Two men were shot by an unknown attacker in a Glendale Walmart on December 7. Neither shooting victim sustained   injuries.

20730,20730,Cyprus: Why One of the World’s Most Intractable Conflicts Continues - The New York Times,Sewell Chan,"LONDON  —   It is home to the   peacekeeping mission in United Nations history. It has been called a diplomatic graveyard, having frustrated generations of negotiators. It has been compared  —   in complexity and duration, not bloodshed  —   to the   conflict. Cyprus has effectively been partitioned since 1974, its Greek and Turkish communities  —   and its capital, Nicosia  —   separated by a buffer zone known as the Green Line. But unlike most conflict zones, Cyprus is more or less at peace, and a popular tourist destination. Hundreds of thousands of people have crossed the line since travel restrictions were eased in 2003. The following year, the country joined the European Union. So why has the conflict defied so many efforts at resolution? The answer has as much to do with domestic politics on both sides of the island as with pressures from Turkey and Greece as well as Britain, the   ruler of Cyprus, James   a scholar at the London School of Economics and the author of several books on the Cyprus conflict, said in a phone interview. On Monday, the Greek Cypriot leader, Nicos Anastasiades, and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mustafa Akinci, began five days of talks brokered by the United Nations at Mont Pèlerin, a Swiss resort. The secretary general, Ban   urged them “to do their utmost in order to reach a settlement within 2016,” and said “the prospect of a solution in Cyprus is within their reach. ” Such hopes have been dashed before. In 2004, the Greek Cypriot community rejected a peace plan brokered by Mr. Ban’s predecessor, Kofi Annan. “Society just wasn’t ready for a deal,” Mr.   said. “What we’re seeing now, though, is that the two leaders are much more aligned. The question is whether they can bring their communities along with them. ” Some answers to basic questions about the conflict: Cyprus has 1. 1 million inhabitants, about the same as Rhode Island, but in an area around three and a half times the size. About 78 percent are Greek Cypriots (most of them Orthodox Christians) and about 18 percent are Turkish Cypriots (most of them Sunni Muslims). The country has three officially recognized Christian minorities  —   Maronites, Latins (Roman Catholics) and Armenians  —   and a small Roma, or Gypsy, community. The internationally recognized government of the Republic of Cyprus controls only the southern   of it. The remaining third is the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Turkey. Cyprus came under British control in the late 19th century, during the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Many Greek Cypriots supported the political union of all Greeks living under Turkish rule within a sovereign Greek nation, while many Turkish Cypriots favored a partition of the island between Greece and Turkey. In the late 1950s, a guerrilla group, the National Organization of Cypriot Fighters, rebelled against British rule. As Cyprus slid toward war, the United States and Britain feared that the conflict could open the door to Soviet dominance in the eastern Mediterranean. Archbishop Makarios, the longtime Greek Cypriot leader, agreed to independence as an alternative to union with Greece. The new country’s Constitution, ratified on Aug. 16, 1960, provided for a Greek Cypriot president, a Turkish Cypriot vice president, and a Civil Service 70 percent Greek Cypriot and 30 percent Turkish Cypriot. Britain, Greece and Turkey pledged to maintain the “sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence” of Cyprus, and Britain kept two sizable military bases there. But after Archbishop Makarios, as president, proposed amendments to the Constitution, fighting between the two communities broke out. Turkish Cypriots say their side was expelled from the government Greek Cypriots say Turkish Cypriots left the government to form a parallel administration. The pivotal year was 1974. That summer, the leader of Greece’s military junta, which controlled a guerrilla group in Cyprus, ousted Archbishop Makarios, who went into exile. Turkish officials believed that a Cypriot union with Greece was imminent. In July, Turkey invaded to protect Turkish Cypriots. The junta in Greece collapsed, but during peace talks Turkey sent in a second wave of troops in August, overrunning the north. Turkish settlers also descended on the north, while about 160, 000 Greek Cypriots were displaced. Over the years, support for political union with Greece has dissipated. Since the late 1970s, leaders on both sides have agreed in principle on a “bizonal, bicommunal federation” as the basis for reunification, but have different understandings of that term. The disagreements affect key issues, including the return of displaced Cypriots and the handling of their property, repatriation of Turkish settlers, demilitarization of the island and the future role of Greece, Turkey and Britain. For most Greek Cypriots, a new federation means two tightly linked federal units, neither defined mainly in ethnic terms for many Turkish Cypriots, maintaining control over a strongly autonomous region is key. Land is also a key issue. Turkish Cypriots control 36 percent of the island’s area, and by most estimates, that proportion will decline to between 26 percent and 29 percent under any lasting peace deal. But the percentage is in dispute, as is where to draw the boundaries. Mr. Annan, the previous secretary general, proposed a   plan, along with a compromise on former Greek Cypriot property. The plan also allowed a limited right of return for displaced members of both communities, and gradual reductions of Greek and Turkish troops. Momentum for the deal was considerable. In 2003, the Turkish Cypriot authorities relaxed travel restrictions, and within two weeks, 200, 000 people had crossed the Green Line. Turkey’s new prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, supported the talks. One major incentive was the Republic of Cyprus’s candidacy for membership in the European Union. But in April 2004, a week before the country formally joined the European Union, Greek Cypriots rejected the deal in a referendum, while Turkish Cypriots voters approved it. The two leaders are fairly new  —   Mr. Anastasiades, a lawyer, took office in 2013, and Mr. Akinci, an architect, last year  —   and seem open to compromise. Unlike past Turkish leaders, Mr. Erdogan is not seen as being personally invested in Cyprus the Greek government, for its part, is dealing with a lingering economic crisis. The legal landscape has shifted. The European Court of Human Rights opened the way for lawsuits from Greek Cypriots who lost property by one reading, even ordinary tourists to the north could potentially face fines for staying at hotels or eating on restaurants built on Greek Cypriot land. That could have a potentially disastrous economic impact in the north. Putting pressure on the Turkish Cypriots, they may soon be outnumbered by the settlers who arrived after the 1974 invasions, and their descendants. The pressure on the Greek Cypriots to negotiate is less clear. While some now believe a de facto partition is permanent, the mainstream view is that reunification is the best outcome, although substantial disagreements remain over what it should look like.",0

[The United for Europe March called for Britain to stay in the EU despite the result of last June’s referendum, with protesters marching just days before Prime Minister Theresa May formally triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.  The demonstrators marched along Piccadilly, Pall Mall and Whitehall, waving European flags and   banners, before listening to speeches outside Parliament. The march comes just days after the Westminster terror attack, resulting in a heavier police presence than usual. Some of the protesters brought along yellow flowers to lay at the memorial to the victims. The organisers said in a statement: “We will not be intimidated. We will stand in unity and solidarity. We will march on the heart of our democracy and reclaim our streets in honour and respect of those that fell. “We will be observing a minute of silence and remembrance at the start of the rally. We would encourage all attendees to bring with them some symbol of respect and to act in the appropriate fashion on the day. ” Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron addressed the crowd, saying: “Our job is to win hearts and minds over these coming months, to win support for a referendum on the deal, to change the direction of the debate and to change the direction of our country. ”",0
20732,20732,"Pentagon Lied To Re-Enlist Soldiers, Thousands To Repay Bonuses",IWB,"Pentagon Lied To Re-Enlist Soldiers, Thousands To Repay Bonuses by IWB · October 26, 2016 
by Edmondo Burr The US Military enticed many soldiers to re-enlist in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars by offering them cash bonuses of over $15,000. 
Now many years later, the Pentagon is asking thousands of veterans to pay back the “improper” bonuses that they accepted in good faith, because of mismanagement and corruption in the California National Guard. 
AntiMedia reports: 
Shortly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the Pentagon hired Bell Pottinger, a London-based PR agency. The PR firm was tasked with promoting what the Pentagon called “democratic elections” in Iraq, ultimately earning over a hundred million dollars yearly. Part of the firm’s job included producing “ fake al Qaeda propaganda films, ” the Bureau of Investigative Journalism recently reported . 
Despite the PR operation’s hefty price tag, the Pentagon seemed to have no issue allocating taxpayer resources to have these videos produced. But over ten years after the Iraq invasion, the Pentagon is now concerned about its past appropriations — at least part of them, anyway. 
Ten years after promising $15,000 bonuses to soldiers willing to re-enlist in 2006 and 2007, the Pentagon is now forcing California veterans to pay the bonuses back. 

In California, the Los Angeles Times reports , “ officials signed up soldiers in assembly-line fashion ” in 2006 and 2007, outlining the “ generous terms available for six-year reenlistments ” to those willing to sacrifice their safety, leaving their homes, once again, to fight abroad in exchange for a large bonus. Now, the Pentagon wants their money back. 
To Get Soldiers to Re-enlist, the National Guard Lied 
In 2008, the movie “ Stop-Loss ” highlighted a reality few members of the public were informed about. 
With the growing involvement of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers who had already served in Iraq and Afghanistan for several tours were being asked to reenlist. Sometimes, these soldiers’ term duties were extended forcefully via the government’s controversial stop-loss policy , which allows the government to extend the period a soldier must spend on active duty involuntarily. 
In California, the state’s National Guard began promising thousands of soldiers that they would receive $15,000 bonuses for going back to war. 
Now, nearly 10,000 soldiers who took the National Guard’s promise at face value are being ordered to pay the bonuses back plus interest charges. In some cases, their wages are being garnished to fund the payments. 
This issue was first brought up when veterans “ whose only mistake was to accept bonuses offered when the Pentagon needed to fill the ranks ” were the target of an investigation launched in 2010. 
After receiving reports of improper payments, a federal probe found “ thousands of bonuses and student loan payments were given to California Guard soldiers who did not qualify for them, or were approved despite paperwork errors. ” 
As a result of the investigation, Army Master Sgt. Toni Jaffe, who also served as the California Guard’s incentive manager, pleaded guilty to filing false claims totaling $15.2 million in 2011. He was sentenced to spend 30 months in federal prison, and three other officers who also pleaded guilty to fraud were put on probation. 
Breaking the National Guard’s promise to soldiers whose reenlistment depended on the bonus distribution, the California Guard “ assigned 42 auditors to comb through paperwork for bonuses and other incentive payments given to 14,000 soldiers. ” 
In September 2016, these auditors finalized the investigation, finding roughly 9,700 current and retired soldiers who had been given “ improper ” bonuses. These soldiers have been told “to repay some or all of their bonuses” since the probe was launched and the first cases were discovered. 
According to the California National Guard, these repayments have recovered more than $22 million so far, compromising veterans like Robert Richmond, who now works for a construction company in Texas. He was an Army Sergeant First Class living in Huntington Beach when in 2006, he was asked to reenlist. 
“ I signed a contract that I literally risked my life to fulfill, ” Richmond explained, adding that he only agreed to go back to war because he was told he qualified for a $15,000 bonus as a special forces soldier. 
The veteran had gone through a divorce after being deployed to Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003. Asked to consider the bonus to reenlist, Richmond thought the money was going to give him “ breathing room, ” so he agreed. In 2007, he was sent to Iraq’s “ Triangle of Death, ” an area a few miles south of Baghdad known for intense fighting. 
In one of the hundreds of missions against insurgents he was a part of, Richmond sustained permanent back and brain injuries after his vehicle triggered a roadside bomb. 
In 2014, the California Guard headquarters contacted him, letting the former special forces soldier know he was being urged to repay the $15,000 bonus he received in 2006. If he failed to make the payment, the letter said, he would face “ debt collection action. ” 
Richmond refused to give the government any money back, filing appeal after appeal. “ [Impacted soldiers] want somebody in the government, anybody, to say this is wrong and we’ll stop going after this money, ” he said. 
‘Support the Troops!’: Code for ‘Don’t Question War?’ 
In Washington, D.C., lawmakers have condemned the Pentagon, saying the soldiers were not at fault for accepting a bonus they were promised. 
Promising to open an investigation into the enlistment bonus problem, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) called the Pentagon’s demands “ disgraceful. ” 
“ The Department of Defense should waive these repayments, ” McCarthy said in a statement . “ The House will investigate these reports to ensure our soldiers are fully honored for their service, ” he added. 
Rep. McCarthy says the government should not be demanding any money back from veterans in his statement. The California Republican and also argued that “ we are the ones who owe a debt for the great sacrifices our heroes have made — some of whom unfortunately paid the ultimate sacrifice. ?” 
Instead of using this opportunity to highlight the importance of safeguarding our soldiers and keeping them from engaging in unconstitutional wars that are only successfully sold to the American public because administrations lie , McCarthy celebrates these very soldiers’ sacrifices. 
Using this discussion to repeat the traditional “support the troops” line, lawmakers like McCarthy steer the debate away from what’s causing these soldiers so much pain and distress, acting as if relentless war hasn’t been the reason they were lied to. Instead, McCarthy and others are pushing the government to keep its promise without reevaluating how the U.S. government goes about irresponsibly sending these men and women abroad to fight insurgents who didn’t pose a threat to Americans at the time . 
In the 1964 film, “ The Americanization of Emily, ” which was based on a novel written by a veteran who had been a SeaBee officer on D-Day, character Lt. Comdr. Charles E. Madison gives a short speech explaining that “ [those] who make heroes of our dead and shrines of our battlefields … perpetuate war by exalting its sacrifices. ” 
Failing to discuss the real costs of war with the American electorate while exalting the sacrifices made by those who serve in the military is part of an ongoing campaign — deliberate or otherwise — to keep America involved in perpetual war. 
Don’t believe me? Don’t take my word for it. Instead, read what journalist Randolph Bourne had to say about the country’s thirst for war in 1918: 
“ In times of peace, we usually ignore the State in favour of partisan political controversies, or personal struggles for office, or the pursuit of party policies. It is the Government rather than the State with which the politically minded are concerned. The State is reduced to a shadowy emblem which comes to consciousness only on occasions of patriotic holiday. … 
“With the shock of war, however, the State comes into its own again. The Government, with no mandate from the people, without consultation of the people, conducts all the negotiations, the backing and filling, the menaces and explanations, which slowly bring it into collision with some other Government, and gently and irresistibly slides the country into war. ” 
War, Bourne concluded , “ is the health of the state. ” This is not because all individuals involved with governing enjoy death and destruction per se, but because “ it is … in war that the urgency for union seems greatest, and the necessity for universality seems most unquestioned, ” which forces the public to unite behind the state no matter what — especially if the occasion leading to war is “ terrifying ” the public. 
While veterans whose bonuses are being questioned ten years later should be heard and protected from government abuse, we must not forget it was government’s own thirst for war that initiated this cycle of deception. Let us not ignore the reasons why we should support our troops — and how we should go about it; simply claiming to be interested in celebrating U.S. soldiers for their sacrifice does nothing for them.

The Democratic Party’s long sojourn into corporate-friendly politics – and neglect of its old working-class base – has led to the shocking result of an erratic and untested outsider becoming President. But is there a route back, asks Joe Lauria. 
By Joe Lauria 
A new political force in America was unleashed on Tuesday and how the Democratic Party reacts to it could determine its future as a major party. Millions of discontented Americans who have lost out to the computerization and the globalization of the economy – and who have been disproportionately called on to fight America’s “regime change” wars – have made clear that they aren’t going to take it anymore. And any party or politician going forward better listen or they will be tossed out, too, including Donald Trump if he doesn’t deliver. 
This election has struck what should be a fatal blow to the Clintons’ Democratic Leadership Council movement. Bill Clinton moved the Democratic Party to the center-right at about the same time that Tony Blair did with the British Labour Party. Both parties cut many of their traditional ties to labor unions in the 1990s to embrace the economic neoliberalism of their 1980s predecessors Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher: welfare reform, deregulation of the financial sector and “free trade.” The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads “Vote Trump” on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota.

The effect on workers across the old industrial belts has been devastating. Millions have been pushed out of a middle-class lifestyle. They have seen their plants close and jobs shipped to cheap labor markets overseas. Or they have lost out to robotics. 
They’ve also seen the economy shift from production to financial speculation. And they’ve seen the greatest transfer of wealth in decades to the obscenely rich. Wealthy liberals who’ve benefited from this shift often act as if they are morally superior to the system’s “losers” who hear Hillary Clinton put them in a “basket of deplorables.” 
On Tuesday, these downwardly mobile workers spoke out, giving Trump the votes he needed in the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin to put him over the top in the Electoral College (although Clinton appears headed toward a plurality of the votes nationally.) 
That someone as eminently unqualified (at least in the traditional sense) could flip the electoral map in this way was stunning. But is the Democratic Party listening and can it adapt to reflect the interests of these Americans? The future of the party may depend on it. 
For the past two decades, Democrats have relied on the support of these Rust Belt states as a bulwark for their national candidacies. These states voted twice for Barack Obama. 
But many of these blue-collar workers were counting on a significant change to their circumstances, but Obama had failed to deliver that and Clinton only vaguely addressed their concerns with a variety of mostly small-bore policy ideas. Many of these voters judged that the Democrats couldn’t or wouldn’t deliver. So, they rudely slapped the party in the face. 
Parallel political trends are playing out in Great Britain, where a discontented working class spearheaded the Brexit withdrawal from the European Union and where Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is fighting to dismantle Blair’s so-called New Labour movement and trying to restore the Labour Party’s historic ties to the working class. 
Last week , we learned in a leaked speech that Bill Clinton gave last year that he denigrated Corbyn, saying Labour “went out and practically got a guy off the street to be the leader” of the party. “When people feel they’ve been shafted and they don’t expect anything to happen anyway, they just want the maddest person in the room to represent them.” 
Bill Clinton’s remarks were typical of the Democrats’ smugness and their contempt for ordinary people. So there was some satisfaction in seeing the humiliation of these careerist and corporatist Democrats on Tuesday. 
Now, the Democratic Party had better figure out how they can serve the interests of those blue-collar workers or the party can expect more of the same. So far they are blaming everyone and everthing for having created this workers’ backlash: sexism, the media, FBI Director James Comey (Clinton pinned it specifically on him), Vladimir Putin, Green Party candidate Jill Stein and even Clinton cheerleader Bernie Sanders (for “poisoning the youth vote”). 
A former Clinton operative speaking on Fox News said the day after an election loss is a time to engage in the “blame game.” He said “everybody is being blamed but Secretary Clinton.” 
Pursuing Solutions 
There are solutions to economic injustice but few in power pursue them because it’s not in their self-interest. And politicians of any party act primarily on self-interest these days, which usually translates into the interests of their wealthy financial backers and is thus inimical to real democracy. President Bill Clinton 
Without a sharp turn to the left to regain workers’ support, the Democratic Party risks becoming totally irrelevant. A new batch of Democratic Party leaders committed to workers must emerge. They have four years to prepare. 
Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren tarnished themselves as leaders who can achieve this by supporting a center-right candidate in Hillary Clinton. They failed to acknowledge that Clinton was too alienated from many blue-collar workers (especially whites) who in the end abandoned the party to gamble on Trump. 
Sanders, an independent who chose to run in the Democratic primaries, had been offered the top of the Green Party ticket. The party’s   Jill Stein, who was willing to give up that spot, said he never answered her. Had they run together they might have gotten the 15 percent in the polls to enter the debates where Sanders would have been a lofty alternative to Clinton and Trump – though had Trump still won on Nov. 8, Sanders surely would have been denounced as a “sore loser” and blamed for “dividing the anti-Trump vote.” 
As it turned out, the Democrats managed to lose the White House to Trump on their own. Though the Democratic leadership won’t admit it, they now know that Sanders was running the right campaign to defend workers’ interests and would have been the right messenger to carry that message. However, to protect their own privileged class interests and those of their donors, establishment Democrats left the country open to the dangerous victory of Donald Trump. 
Rust Belt working-class voters can’t be blamed for the choices they were given. Without Sanders – and with the Democrats offering one more establishment candidate – these alienated voters instead sent a demagogue to the White House, clinging to the hope that he might keep some of his promises: to end ruinous trade deals, bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S., create jobs by rebuilding the infrastructure, avoid new wars and clean the D.C. swamp of corruption. 
Judging by the people being mentioned for his Cabinet, it’s already looking dodgy: the usual cast of right-wing Republicans – the likes of Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani – who have been part of the problem going back decades. 
Yet, if Trump fails to fulfill his promises to improve the economy for common Americans, the voters he so skillfully riled up might well send him packing in 2020 unless, of course, the Democrats put up another corporate choice. 
That leaves the notoriously difficult path for a third party that could represent the interests of ordinary Americans. But that possibility showed little traction in 2016, with marginal vote totals for both the Libertarian and Green parties. 
Media Also Repudiated 
On the positive side, this election became a repudiation not only of the Democratic Party insiders, but also of establishment Republicans, Wall Street, celebrity culture (with famous people flocking to Clinton) and the mainstream news media. The Pentagon, headquarters of the U.S. Defense Department, as viewed with the Potomac River and Washington, D.C., in the background. (Defense Department photo) 
The shock to the American political system also is prompting admissions one would never have imagined hearing. On Fox News the morning after the election, a group of personalities (calling themselves “journalists”) were suddenly talking about class in America, a normally taboo subject. 
One of them said journalists didn’t understand this election because none of them know anyone who makes less than $60,000 a year. Apparently, these pampered performers don’t even mix with many members of their own profession. I can introduce them to plenty of journalists making less than that, let alone Rust Belt workers. 
Will Rahn of CBS News accused the media of missing the story “after having spent months mocking the people who had a better sense of what was going on. This is all symptomatic of modern journalism’s great moral and intellectual failing: its unbearable smugness .” 
Rahn said working-class people have “captured the imagination of journalists, who have come to talk about them like colonial administrators would talk about a primitive inland tribe that interferes with the construction of a jungle railway: They must be pacified until history kills them off.” 
These are stunning admissions that would never have happened without this election result. But one wonders how long such introspection in the corporate media will last. After the mainstream media got the Iraq WMD story wrong and contributed to the disastrous 2003 invasion, there were a few halfhearted mea culpas but very little accountability. 
For instance, Washington Post editorial-page editor Fred Hiatt, who repeatedly wrote as flat fact that Iraq was hiding WMD and who mocked the few dissenting voices trying to warn Americans about the flimsiness of the evidence, is still the editorial-page editor of The Washington Post. 
So, not surprisingly – with almost none of the “star journalists” suffering any career setbacks – the corporate media was soon joining more propaganda campaigns for more wars, which are mostly fought by young working-class men and women who actually do suffer. 
The difference now is that this new political force of fed-up voters – who “came out of nowhere” as far as the Democrats and the media were concerned although these voters were staring them in the face – might now force a re-evaluation. That’s because these voters are likely still to be there four years from now.

20736,20736,"Art-House Fare Hopes for an Oscar-Nod Push, as ‘Split’ Rules North America - The New York Times",Brooks Barnes,"Nominations for the 89th Academy Awards will be announced on Tuesday, and movie marketers will be ready to pounce with ads that try to coax more people into seats: The establishment is swooning! Get to a theater! It works. Research indicates that Oscar nominations often result in tens of millions in additional ticket sales, particularly for     films. Among the movies counting on awards attention to find a bigger audience is “Moonlight. ” Seen as a leading contender for best picture, this euphorically reviewed drama about a young black man in Miami started strong but has stalled. It has taken in about $15. 8 million over 14 weeks. For “Silence,” Martin Scorsese and Paramount desperately need the academy to help their   drama from becoming a financial washout. Costing $50 million to make, “Silence,” a passion project for Mr. Scorsese as director, has collected $5. 2 million since its arrival on Dec. 23. “Lion,” a   set largely in India, is a Weinstein Company film that has earned $16. 4 million  —   a solid result for an art film of its type but still a long way from Weinstein awards hits in recent years. (Another Weinstein movie, “The Founder,” about the start of the McDonald’s   empire, arrived to $3. 4 million in ticket sales over the weekend.) “20th Century Women,” a comedic drama about a quirky mother (Annette Bening) in the late 1970s, has taken in $2. 3 million. An Oscar nomination for Ms. Bening would help give it momentum. As for the weekend, “Split,” the latest thriller from M. Night Shyamalan and Blumhouse Productions, was the No. 1 movie in North America. Expertly marketed by Universal Pictures, which leaned on   digital promotions, “Split” sold an estimated $40. 2 million in tickets, far surpassing prerelease analyst expectations. “Split” cost just $9 million to make, with Mr. Shyamalan personally footing the bill. Arriving as a distant second was “XXX: The Return of Xander Cage” (Paramount) which managed roughly $20 million  —   an underwhelming start for a film that cost at least $125 million to make and market and was designed to revive an action series that had been dormant for 12 years. Instead, “The Return of Xander Cage,” starring Vin Diesel, who tried to rally his 101 million Facebook followers, will likely become more evidence that Americans have little appetite for movie franchises that have been on ice for more than a few years. (See: “Independence Day: Resurgence” and “Zoolander 2. ”) Paramount, which offset its financial risk by bringing in partners, said the film collected an additional $50. 5 million in partial release overseas and called it “the No. 1 movie in the world. ” Rounding out the top three, “Hidden Figures” (20th Century Fox) continued to ride strong word of mouth, taking in roughly $16. 3 million, for a   domestic total of $84. 2 million, according to comScore, which compiles ticketing data.",0

Bannon Wednesday of Hillary Clinton confidant Huma Abedin, “Most of the experts I’ve spoken to conclude, looking at the various facts regarding Huma–her rise, where she came from, her family background, her various connections–conclude that she is most likely a Saudi spy, which is my own conclusion.” 
Stone also discusses the “clear, deep, inarguable, indisputable connections between Huma Abedin and a Saudi Arabian official named Abdullah Omar Naseef … one of the founders of the Muslim World League (MWL). …. The MWL is directly tied to the Rabita Trust, a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity,” which Stone previously discussed : Naseef, the Muslim World League, and the government of Pakistan created the Rabita Trust in 1988. Naseef was a sponsor and financial supporter of Syed Abedin’s IMMA. Just a month after the 9/11 jihadist attack left thousands dead and brought down the World Trade Center, President George W. Bush’s Executive Order designated the Rabita Trust as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity and the Treasury Department froze its assets on October 12, 2001. Naseef founded the Rabita Trust and remains involved with it to this day. A Treasury Department press release issued when Rabita Trust’s assets were frozen indicated that Rabita Trust is headed by Wa’el Hamza Jalaidan, one of the founders of al-Qaida with bin Laden. He was the logistics chief of bin Laden’s organization and fought on bin Laden’s side in Afghanistan. Jalaidan himself was branded a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Entity by the United States Treasury Department, and his assets have been frozen, as well. 
Stone also contended that much of what the Clintons have done via their foundation is “treasonous.” 
“They have taken money from the Chinese, the Russians, the Saudis and they’d sold our country’s secrets. They’ve sold our country’s decisions.” 
Stone delved into some of the emerging details involving Hillary confidant Huma Abedin previously with Breitbart News: Huma Abedin is Vice Chair of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. But Huma is more, much more than that. She is the person closest to the most powerful woman in American politics and perhaps the next President. Huma has been described variously as Hillary’s “body woman,” a sort of glorified go-to personal maid, gentle confidant, and by others as an Islamic spy. She may be all of these things, because as we shall see, Huma Abedin has an interesting and complex career history. 
Politico and several other Beltway media outlets followed up on Stone’s previous appearance on Breitbart News Daily: “ Trump Ally: Clinton Aide Could Be ‘Terrorist Agent’ ”: In the wake of Sunday’s deadly terrorist shooting in Orlando, Donald Trump’s longtime friend and informal adviser wants the presumptive Republican nominee to hit Hillary Clinton even harder, suggesting the former secretary of state’s top aide Huma Abedin could be a “Saudi spy” or a “terrorist agent.” Only Trump, Roger Stone said on Sirius XM’s “Breitbart News Daily,” will be able to draw the necessary amount of attention to the theories, which have drawn significant blowback from Democrats and Republicans alike. “I also think that now that Islamic terrorism is going to be front and center, there’s going to be a new focus on whether this administration, the administration of Hillary Clinton at State was permeated at the highest levels by Saudi intelligence and others who are not loyal Americans,” Stone said. “I speak specifically of Huma Abedin, the right-hand woman, now vice-chairman or co-chairman of vice—of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.”",1

ORLÉANS, – France – Like a Phoenix from the flames, soon France may find liberty and freedom again from the stifling octopus grip of the socialists and EU unelected swine. 


Au revoir Sarko, you have had your day. Marine Le Pen is sweeping to the helm of the right wing candidates and Fillon will be swept aside too in the upcoming French election in May, 2017. 
To be set free from the shackles of euro slavery, and for her economy to shoot up into the outer reaches of space, can the French maiden let loose from the darkness and reach her hand into the light to free France once and for all? 
Could this be another Trump/Brexit moment at the polls? 
The EU and its ludicrous Schengen policy has stifled France, muffled her voice and condemned her to the wild tax mad ramblings of the clinically insane Francois Hollande — a puerile man whose idea of economic embellishment is to categorically destroy everything with socialistic punitive taxes and burdensome mass unfettered migration. 
Can the rising Joan of Arc save France from being marginalised forever? The French are understandably fed up with the EU communist entity and will do or vote for a saviour from the filthy dank EU prison. The boulevards of Paris may once again be something to be proud of, instead of a stinking piss filled camp of degradation. 
The Bastille gates will be breached and the EU technicians taken to the guillotine for some swift justice. 
Vive La France, they will shout as the heads roll into the baskets, these bringers of EU monstrosities onto a land that once coined the phrase Liberté, égalité, fraternité, only to be given Contraite, inégalité, haine. Share on :",1

Should have put the muzzle on his balls for more self-inflicted humiliation
Where are the mythical heroes, triumphing against all odds? Now Mad Max waits patiently in the car while a bonehead empowered you go grrrrl takes the decisions.
It seems that we have to turn towards Russia once more for our recommended daily dose of normal masculinity.
As red pill and cold-blooded as it gets 
“Brother” (“Brat” in Russian) is a 1997 movie directed by Alexey Balabanov. It is seen by many as the one of the greatest gangster movie of all time and changed forever the image of the traditional justice-seeking hero.
It has been a few years at least that I want to share my discovery of this film with our readers. It had a tremendous impact on the way I see the world and the attitude I have towards life. I was convinced of its quality, of the impact it could have on the disciples of the red pill and that a few lines cannot do justice to this giant of Russian cinema culture. It entirely deserves an article of its own.
My brother, the criminal 
Enter Danila Bagrov, played by the stellar Sergey Bodrov, who died at 28, at the peak of his meteor-like career. Many called him the Russian James Dean.
After serving in the bloody war theatre of Chechnya, young veteran Danila returns home, in the sleepy provincial town of Tula.
Needing money and without any solid prospects, he joins his brother Vytia who works as a hitman for the local “well-dressed businessman” in Saint Petersburg. Being an expert in making rudimentary weapons and with his quick capacity of reaction and frugality, Danila adapts marvelously to his new occupation.

After seeing the risk of a gifted concurrent stealing their livelihood, the city’s gangsters soon put a price on his head and send a few professionals to tie up this loose end. But even after being betrayed by a mix of greed and cowardice, young Danila Bagrov decides to take on the mob single handedly.
An epitome of the Russian alpha. Hard and unforgiving, sober in words and in behaviour, for whom nothing counts more than the bonds of blood and brotherhood.
To err is human 
His one soft spot is the faith he has in human nature, convinced that if he does good, his fellow man will be virtuous in return. He could not be more wrong, especially with women. He discovers very fast that beta moves like buying them gifts and helping them only brings him trouble or ungratefulness.
What is rare and makes Danila stand out is his loyalty, a cornerstone of the definition of masculinity and a value that progressively vanishes nowadays. His brother will do the unthinkable. But after the storm clears and Danila emerges victorious, he proves once more his quality as a man by being magnanimous and giving him a second chance.
No fancy green screen or politically correct themes 
Brat is good because it is painfully real and does not embellish the lawless chaos that was early post-Soviet Russia. This is how it felt when the Wall came down. Everyone was trying to survive the best way they could.
The odd, low-quality orange filter used in the film reminds us of this period where everything was made from what people could find when the shelves where empty.
You cannot go wrong with a good revenge movie and Danila is an example of bravery. Alone and against all odds, he takes on the mafia that wronged him and will make them pay.
The man says it like it is His analysis of the city and its perverse influence on men is brutally accurate:

Danila: You told me about the city, about its strength. But here, everyone is weak.
Hoffman: The city is a great and terrible force. It sucks the life force out of the strong – turns them weak. It takes away your power. And you fell right in the middle of it.
His opinion about the abuse of power and the corrupt elites that would kill mother and father for their own profit and the final victory of truth applies especially well to today’s political and social context.

American, what’s your power? Is it really money? My brother says it’s money. You’ve got lots of money – so what?
Truth is a real power. Whoever is right is strong. You cheated on a man and took away his money. Did it make you stronger? No, it did not, ’cause you are not right, and the person you cheated on is. That means he’s stronger. Right?
“Brother” also drops lethal truths about women and their ways. After spending all his roubles buying drinks and dope for a young interchangeable skank, she tells Danila:

Kate: Do you have condoms?
Danila: Why?
Kate: ‘Why? You really think I will give you back your money? Come here…
Two brothers for two majestic films 
The second volume, simply titled “Brother 2”, breaks the stereotype that sequels are always awful and is at least as good, if not better than the original.
Same characters are followed but this time, Danila’s brother in arms has been played by a crooked American businessman, in touch with the Muscovite mafia. They attacked his brothers once more and he will have this time to cross the Atlantic to reclaim what is rightfully his.
Again, the movie is realistic, gritty but has a lighter outlook on life. Whereas in the first volume, the main character showed a sheer hatred for everything that came from America and corrupted his country, the sequel that involves Danila’s adventures and clueless discovery of American culture often results in hilarious encounters.
Un film qui prend aux tripes 
If the red pill was a religion, Danila Bagrov could be its patron saint. You can watch it legally following this link which includes English subtitles. The firm KinoKompania STV that produced the film decided to release it online, the film being such a household name in Russia and worldwide.
Needless to say that you have watch it in the original Russian. The second opus can also be found online with English subtitles and Russian audio.
Don’t miss out on these monuments of Russian cinema.

20742,20742,It Begins! Ten Kushner Scandals: Media Ramp Up Attacks on President’s Democrat Manhattanite Son-in-Law,Tony Lee,"If Jared Kushner did not realize that the establishment press and Democrats will never give him or President Donald Trump a free ride after Democrats politicized Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, he is now learning how viciously the antagonistic press can pile on when seeking to destroy their opposition. And it looks like the establishment media are just getting started. [After the Washington Post named Kushner as the “person of interest” in the FBI’s Russia investigation, Kushner, in just a matter of days, as Fox News’s Howard Kurtz wrote, “has become the media’s biggest target —  that is, right after his   . ”  Kushner may have thought firing Comey would be a “win” for Trump because Democrats blamed Comey for costing Hillary Clinton the election. But the media never granted Trump a honeymoon period and will not give him automatic “wins” because they consider him an illegitimate outsider. And, as Kushner is finding out, because he is regarded as Trump’s top adviser, Kushner will always be in the media’s crosshairs no matter how much he tries to “moderate” Trump or court and charm the media. After media outlets initially reported that a White House official in Trump’s inner circle was a “person of interest” in the FBI’s Russia investigation, the Washington Post last Friday dropped a supposed “bombshell” report naming Kushner as the “person of interest” who allegedly wanted a “back channel” to communicate with Russian officials. But as Breitbart    Joel Pollak noted, nothing in the Post’s article was new: “The meeting with Kislyak was reported nearly three months ago. The meeting with the banker was reported two months ago. And stories about a potential ‘back channel’ were reported almost two months ago. ” In fact, Kushner is reportedly not even a “target” of the investigation. There is also no smoking gun proving Kushner colluded with Russia or did anything illegal, for that matter, as former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper emphasized on Sunday. But the media have treated Kushner, like they do with nearly every Republican who does not have favored status with them, as if he is guilty until proven innocent. The establishment press have largely brushed aside the notion that Kushner may have wanted to set up the “back channel” to discuss Syria policy, especially if he feared that the Obama administration may have been spying on Trump’s campaign team. Fox News reported that the idea for a “back channel” was not even Kushner’s idea in the first place. The media have also downplayed the fact that Russians often embellish things to engage in disinformation campaigns. Take CNN’s report, based on leaks from two anonymous former intelligence officials and even a congressional source, about the Russians having potentially “derogatory” information on Trump and his top aides. CNN reported that the Russians believed they had “leverage” on Trump’s inner circle, especially regarding financial issues. It is only until after the sensational claims are made that the outlet points out that this information “could have been exaggerated or even made up” because “the Russians could be overstating” things. There are certainly more questions that need to be answered —  like whether Kushner met with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov as a representative of his private company or as a representative of Trump’s transition team. But the controversy surrounding Kushner, which the media have ginned up with their anonymous leakers from the Deep State intent on undermining Trump, has given the media an excuse to damage Kushner politically. As if the media had many of these stories in their back pockets for the perfect time, the media immediately blitzed Kushner with an onslaught negative pieces. Here are ten ways the antagonistic press, with help from Deep State officials, have recently ganged up on Kushner. 1. Romney Redux: Kushner Depicted as Soulless Slumlord, The establishment media never investigated Obama’s top confidante and adviser Valerie Jarrett’s real estate holdings to depict her as a slumlord despite a body of evidence that was right in front of them. But nearly four months into Trump’s presidency, the media suddenly had the resources and the wherewithal to find former tenants who lived in Kushner’s properties to depict Trump’s    as a seedy slumlord. ProPublica and the New York Times collaborated on an extensive story about Kushner’s real estate holdings and depicted Kushner as a seedy and greedy slumlord. The piece was titled, “The Beleaguered Tenants of ‘Kushnerville. ” They found former tenant Kamiia Warren, who reportedly moved out of her East Baltimore townhouse when a neighbor started acting strangely —  like shouting through and banging on the walls at night, which often woke up her child. According to the report, “Warren sent a letter reporting the problem to the complex’s property manager” and “submitted the requisite form giving two months’ notice that she was transferring her Section 8 voucher  —   the federal   subsidy that helped her pay the rent  —   elsewhere. The complex’s   manager signed the form a week later, checking the line that read ‘The tenant gave notice in accordance with the lease. ’” Three years later, according to the report, she was sued for $3, 014. 08 by JK2 Westminster LLC, Kushner’s real estate company, and the lawsuit “claimed she owed the money for having left in advance of her lease’s expiration, though she had received written permission to leave. ” The establishment media are at their best when depicting Republicans (or even Democrats like Kushner who are now associated with Republicans) as heartless (see: Mitt Romney). The report points out that “Warren was raising three children alone while taking classes for a bachelor’s degree in health care administration” and paints Kushner and his associates as villains who preyed on an innocent single mother. According to the report, Warren lost her first appeal because “she did not have a copy of the form the manager had signed. The judge ruled against Warren, awarding JK2 Westminster the full sum it was seeking, plus court costs, attorney’s fees and interest that brought the judgment to nearly $5, 000. ” Kushner’s company has reportedly pursued such actions against “hundreds” of past tenants over the last five years. When Warren could not afford to pay the judgment, Kushner’s company “filed a request to garnish her wages from her   elder care job. Five days earlier, Warren had gone to court to fill out a handwritten motion saying she had proof that she was given permission to leave Cove Village in 2010  —   she had finally managed to get a copy from the housing department. ” But since she did not know that she had to attach a copy of her form to the motion, it was denied. Warren’s bank account was ultimately “zeroed out” and when she returned to court with all of the proper paperwork, her case was reportedly dismissed again without explanation. One of Kushner’s lawyers reportedly told her, “This is not going to go away. You will pay us. ” Soon after, according to the report, “the court sent notice of a $4, 615 lien against Warren. ” 2. Kushner Threw Trump Under Bus, Claimed    Thinks GOP Base Is ‘Stupid’ When a former Kushner employee (  York Observer editor) claimed that Kushner once told her that Trump was promoting “birtherism” even though “he really doesn’t believe it” because “he knows Republicans are stupid and they’ll buy it,” the press jumped on the comments as proof that Trump is a “man with no real morals, no real beliefs, but who is willing to peddle any sort of hatred or monstrous thought if he thinks that it will help him toward the nebulous goal of ‘winning. ’” 3. Media Report Trump ‘Angry’ at Kushner, Relationship Showing ‘Unmistakable Signs of Strain’ Though Trump went on the record to publicly support Kushner, the media did their best to undercut Trump’s comments with stories about how Trump was losing confidence in Kushner’s judgment and political acumen. Trump explicitly told the New York Times that “Jared is doing a great job for the country” and “I have total confidence in him. He is respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars. In addition to that, and perhaps more importantly, he is a very good person. ” Yet, media outlets pointed out that Trump was not that close to Kushner before Kushner joined his campaign and quoted anonymous sources who said that Trump has yelled at Kushner in recent meetings. The Times reported that Trump has even made snide and disparaging comments about Kushner’s family after Kushner’s sister reportedly tried to peddle her brother’s access in the White House and “dangled the availability of   visas to the United States as an enticement for Chinese financiers willing to spend $500, 000 or more” to invest in Kushner’s real estate holdings. 4. Huffington Post: Marrying Ivanka on Calculating Kushner’s ‘Checklist’ to ‘Rehabilitate’ Family Name, According to the   Huffington Post, “when Charles Kushner was heading to federal prison in 2005 for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering, his son Jared got some advice from Howard Rubenstein ― the dean of New York damage control ― on how to rehabilitate the Kushner name, Charles would later tell a family friend”: Step one: Buy a New York newspaper. Don’t be too particular, Rubenstein told Jared, according to the family friend’s recounting of their conversation with Charles. Any newspaper will do. Step two: Buy a big Manhattan building. Any building will do. Step three: Marry the daughter of a rich New York family. Anyone will do. The Huffington Post notes that Jared Kushner “went on to do just that. He bought the New York Observer in 2006, made a   $1. 8 billion purchase of 666 Fifth Ave. in 2007 and married Ivanka Trump in 2009. ” “Whether or not Kushner was indeed working through a checklist, his actions during those years have served him well,” the “story” points out. “They also laid the groundwork for the meticulous public relations strategy that has made possible Kushner’s current paradoxical role in the press, as a blameless yet uniquely powerful member of the Trump administration. ” Kushner’s spokesman reportedly denied the account and Rubenstein told the outlet that the account was “preposterous” and “I never said that or anything like that. ” But when it comes to making Trump’s    look bad, such a story is too good for outlets like the Huffington Post not to print. 5. Former Kushner Employees Smear Jared: ‘Vindictive Sh*thead’ Media outlets who were uncurious for eight years about former employees of top Obama administration officials suddenly started interviewing former employees and editors of Kushner’s newspaper —  the New York Observer. Of course, the media found those who were all too eager to smear Kushner. An “anonymous” editor described to the Washington Post that Kushner was insistent on getting a “hit job” on a banker who would not help Kushner refinance one of his buildings. Kushner was reportedly still upset when the paper’s editors —  even after assigning three different reporters to find dirt on the banker —  decided that “there’s no story there. ” Politico spoke to another former Kushner employee —  Harleen Kahlon —  who claimed that Kushner asked her to “take one for the team” and forego her performance bonus based on meeting “agreed upon metrics on page views and audience growth. ”: Kahlon abruptly quit. Ever since, whenever she sees him on TV or on the streets of New York, she points him out to people as: “the guy that stole my money. Just before the election, Kahlon described her former boss on Facebook thusly: “We’re talking about a guy who isn’t particularly bright or   doesn’t actually know anything, has bought his way into everything ever (with money he got from his criminal father) who is deeply insecure and obsessed with fame (you don’t buy the NYO, marry Ivanka Trump, or constantly talk about the phone calls you get from celebrities if it’s in your nature to ‘shun the spotlight’) and who is basically a shithead. ” 6.   Officials Claim Kushner Guilty of Espionage, May Even Be Russian Agent, Though Obama’s former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that his “dashboard warning light was clearly on” when he found out about Kushner’s dealing with Russian agents, he emphasized that there is “no evidence of collusion. ” But the media rushed to get former Deep State officials who were all too eager to slam Kushner. Former intelligence agent Malcolm Nance suggested Kushner may be guilty of espionage and called for Kushner’s security clearance to be revoked immediately. Former double agent Naveed Jamali went as far to say he thought Kushner was actually a Russian agent, a comment which even shocked an MSNBC host. 7. Media Suggest Kushner Family Want to Profit off Trump Presidency, Media outlets hinted that Kushner and his family may be more interested in using Trump’s presidency to pad their bottom lines and enhancing their images. They pointed to the fact that a day before Kushner’s sister sought funding from Chinese investors through the   investor visa program, Trump extended the program when he signed the most recent spending bill, “raising many eyebrows. ” Even the suggestion that Kushner and his family may be trying to profit off Trump’s name has made Trump livid, according go the Times. The Times pointed out Kushner’s sister’s   pitch to Chinese nationals “violated two major rules: Politically, it undercut his immigration crackdown, and in a personal sense, it smacked of profiteering off Mr. Trump  —   one of the sins that warrants expulsion from his orbit. ” 8. Kushner Is ‘Naive,’ ‘Unqualified’ and Dumb  …     Establishment media outlets used comments from former intelligence officials to push the narrative that Kushner was “in over his head” and naive to handle foreign affairs. When asked about Kushner’s alleged action, Michael Hayden, the former CIA and NSA Director, told CNN, “right now, I’m going with naïveté, and that’s not particularly comforting for me. ” “What manner of ignorance, chaos, hubris, suspicion, contempt would you have to have to think that doing this with the Russian ambassador was a good or an appropriate idea? ,” he asked. Former KGB spy Jack Barsky told CNN that Kushner was “naive” and “completely unqualified” to deal with the Russians because of the “inexperience he has in international affairs. ” He called Kushner’s alleged actions “ . ” 9.   …     Or Maybe ‘Desperate’? The Atlantic’s David Frum suggested that perhaps Kushner was not naive but rather desperate to get financing for his family’s Manhattan tower. “Maybe Kushner was desperate, not dumb   …     His family faced a huge hike in its debt servicing costs in December 2016. ” Frum wrote. He cited a Bloomberg News report that claimed a Manhattan tower that Kushner’s family   “has been losing money for three years and faces increasing loan fees in 2017, which may explain why the family has been negotiating with Chinese insurance behemoth Anbang on new financing”: The fees, at 666 Fifth Avenue, kicked in last month and escalate with each payment until the loan is repaid, a 2011 refinancing agreement shows. December brings another hurdle: Interest paid on the bulk of about $1. 1 billion of loans jumps to 6. 35 percent, more than double what it was after the debt was refinanced in 2011. And as the city’s biggest office construction boom in a quarter century creates a glut of supply, the property’s occupancy rates are falling. Seventy percent of the building was filled as of September, filings by LNR Partners, the loan managers, show. This is well below 91 percent for the New York metro area reported at year’s end by Reis, the   firm, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jeffrey Langbaum. 10. Media: ‘Miserable,’ ‘Unhappy’  Distraught Kushner May Want to Go Back to NYC, After Kushner was named as the “person of interest,” the media quickly reported that Kushner has been “miserable,” “unhappy” and “frustrated” with his job as he has come under more scrutiny. It is as if they had these paragraphs already written, ready to be fired off at the best possible moment. The Times cited anonymous “friends” who told the outlet that Kushner “and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have made no   commitment to remain by Mr. Trump’s side, saying they would review every six months whether to return to private life in New York. ” Politico reported that there is a “sense of uncertainty about how long Kushner and Ivanka Trump  —   who associates say likes, but doesn’t love, Washington  —   are planning to stick it out. Some have noted that they rent their Kalorama mansion, which allows them to keep their options of moving back to Manhattan more open. ” On Wednesday, the Times reported that Trump “has not ruled out the possibility” that Kushner and Ivanka “would return to New York this year. ” Writing in the Guardian, Walter Shapiro predicted that Kushner’s “life in the coming months and maybe years will be a study in misery” because “he will probably spend more time with his personal lawyer, Clinton justice department veteran Jamie Gorelick, than with Ivanka or his children. Whether it is an appearance under oath on Capitol Hill or the inevitable FBI interview, every sentence Kushner utters will bring with it possible legal jeopardy. ” Shapiro, citing Kushner’s sister’s   visa exploits, wrote that perhaps “Kushner just calculated that all the hype surrounding his White House role was a     family branding opportunity. ” He also suggests that Kushner may end up behind bars, if he is not careful, like his father: “the worst thing that can happen to an   real estate investor (as Trump himself knows well) is bankruptcy. When the FBI and special prosecutor Robert Mueller get involved, the penalties can theoretically involve steel bars locking behind you. ” If Kushner did not realize it already, he should be well aware by now that the Democrats, the institutional left, and the   establishment media seek to destroy, do not give an inch, and play for keeps. And they may just be warming up.",0
20743,20743,Trump to Seek $54 Billion Increase in Military Spending - The New York Times,Michael D. Shear and Jennifer Steinhauer,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump put both political parties on notice Monday that he intends to slash spending on many of the federal government’s most politically sensitive programs  —   relating to education, the environment, science and poverty  —   to protect the economic security of retirees and to shift billions more to the armed forces. The proposal to increase military spending by $54 billion and cut nonmilitary programs by the same amount was unveiled by White House officials as they prepared the president’s plans for next year’s federal budget. Aides to the president said final decisions about Medicare and Social Security would not be made until later in the year, when he announces his full budget. But Sean Spicer, his spokesman, cited Mr. Trump’s campaign commitments about protecting those programs and vowed that “he’s going to keep his word to the American people. ” In effect, Mr. Trump appears determined to take sides in a generational struggle between older, sicker Americans who depend on the entitlement programs, and their younger, poorer counterparts whose livelihoods are shaped by the domestic programs likely to see steep cuts. He also set up a battle for control of Republican Party ideology with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who for years has staked his   reputation on the argument that taming the budget deficit without tax increases would require that Congress change, and cut, the programs that swallow the bulk of the government’s spending  —   Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. “I don’t know how you take $54 billion out without wholesale taking out entire departments,” said Bill Hoagland, a longtime Republican budget aide in the Senate and now a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “You need to control it in the area of the entitlement programs, which he’s taken off the table. It is a proposal, I dare say, that will be dead on arrival even with a Republican Congress. ” Speaking to governors at the White House, Mr. Trump said his spending demands would be at the core of the speech he gives Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress. “This budget follows through on my promise to keep Americans safe,” he said, calling it a “public safety and national security” budget that will send a “message to the world in these dangerous times of American strength, security and resolve. ” In the first part of the speech, Mr. Trump will recount “promises made and promises kept,” said the aides, who requested anonymity during a briefing with reporters. The rest of the speech will focus on how he will help people with their problems and how he intends to protect the nation. The president’s budget proposals  —   which were short on detail but are said to exempt not just Medicare and Social Security but also veterans’ benefits and law enforcement efforts  —   would lead to deep reductions in federal programs that touch millions of lives. The White House signaled that it would begin with agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service and social   programs. A budget with no entitlement cuts and one that does not balance most likely has no chance of passing the House, and could be rejected by Senate Republicans as well. Mr. Trump’s proposals are too far to the right in terms of domestic cuts and too far to the left in terms of balance. Their failure could have practical implications for the White House. If Congress fails to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, Mr. Trump’s promise to drastically rewrite the tax code could also die, since the president was counting on that budget resolution to include special parliamentary language that would shield his tax cuts from a Democratic filibuster. Without it, any tax legislation would have to be bipartisan enough to clear the Senate with 60 votes. But beyond legislative considerations, the fate of Mr. Trump’s proposal will go a long way toward determining how significantly his brand of economic populism has changed Republican orthodoxy. Mr. Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that Republican promises to transform Medicare and slash entitlement spending were the reason the party lost the White House in 2012, helpfully   Mr. Ryan, who sat at the bottom of the ticket that year, in his analysis. Social Security, health care and net interest now comprise nearly 60 percent of all federal spending, and that figure is expected to soar to 82 percent over the next 10 years. “Paul Ryan’s budget plans with cuts to Social Security and Medicare are not that popular with most voters, and what helped elect Donald Trump was the promise not to cut benefits and programs,” said Douglas Elmendorf, the recently departed director of the Congressional Budget Office and current dean of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. “That is an unresolved tension. ” White House officials said the broad outlines of a spending plan represented the logical culmination of Mr. Trump’s efforts to make good on his campaign pledges to prune what he considers wasteful government spending even as he expands what he considers an underfunded military. “It will show the president is keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do,” said Mick Mulvaney, the president’s budget director. “We are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars. ” Mr. Trump’s advisers said aid to foreign governments, which makes up a tiny fraction of federal spending, was one such target. The budget for the I. R. S. which was the target of Republican criticism during Barack Obama’s administration, would be slashed by 14 percent, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provides grants for community banks and local development, would be all but eliminated. The White House blueprint calls for a 24 percent cut to the E. P. A. ’s budget, according to a person who had seen the document but was not authorized to speak on the record. That would amount to a reduction of about $2 billion from the agency’s annual budget of about $8. 1 billion, reducing its spending to levels not seen since Ronald Reagan’s presidency. But it is far from clear whether Congress will approve such steep cuts in popular programs. While congressional Republicans have long targeted the E. P. A. ’s regulatory authority, they are also aware that about half the agency’s annual budget is passed through to popular   programs, like converting abandoned industrial sites into sports stadiums and other public facilities, which lawmakers of both parties are loath to cut. And most of the agency’s federal office spending goes toward funding programs that are required by existing laws. Last year, even as congressional Republicans railed against the Obama administration’s E. P. A. regulations, they proposed cutting only $291 million from the agency’s budget. Environmental advocates denounced the proposed cuts, saying they would devastate environmental protection and public health programs while doing little to increase national security. “The assault on human health begins now with President Trump’s plan to slash the E. P. A. ’s resources, which are vital to protecting Americans’ drinking water and air from pollution,” said Scott Faber, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group. But the information to emerge about the budget raises more questions than it answers. Democrats, of course, will be no friend, either. “Democrats will make crystal clear the misplaced priorities of the administration and the Republican majority,” said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the   Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, “and we will fight tooth and nail to protect services and investments that are critical to   American families and communities across the country. ” But the budget may be the most striking example in Mr. Trump’s young presidency of the ways in which he is challenging the orthodoxy of his own party. Since the start of his insurgent campaign, Mr. Trump has opposed the Republican Party’s   positions on a range of policies, including free trade, how to deal with Russia and the future of government entitlement programs. Republicans in Congress had hoped that the influence of the two former Republican House members in Mr. Trump’s cabinet  —   Tom Price, head of health and human services, and Mr. Mulvaney  —   would have led to new conclusions about the need to address entitlement programs that are swelling drastically with baby boomers’ retirement. Instead, Mr. Trump appears intent on extracting the savings he needs for military spending from the one part of the budget already most squeezed, domestic discretionary spending.",0
20744,20744,The Battleship Debate,Michael Shrimpton,"By Michael Shrimpton on October 30, 2016 Some Battleship Myths Busted 
The comments on last week’s column (Aberfan – Disaster Or Attack?) threw up some unexpected comments about battleships, and the causes of World War I. As you can tell, it was a wide-ranging discussion! It also showed that that a number of myths about battleships, not to mention the causes of World War I, are still prevalent. First however, some comments on the exciting presidential race. Trump or Clinton? 
I’m still predicting a win for Trump. The polls have tightened, which is not good news for Hillary, and the first straws in the wind suggesting a landslide for Trump have appeared. Some polls are still showing a lead for the Democrat, but the most reliable ones seem to be showing Trumpy ahead by 1 or 2 points. 
A delighted Washington Post predicted this week that Trumpy has “next to zero” chance of winning. I’m not sure that’s true even if you accept the polls as accurate. The polls are suggesting a tight race. However pollsters have a history of getting it wrong when it comes to races involving conservatives. The margin of error in favor of liberal positions differs from one pollster to another, but between 2.5 and 5% seems about right. 
Since the last two Republican candidates were scarcely conservatives, the reasonably good performance of most polling organisations in 2008 and 2012 has to be viewed with reserve. Polling performance breaks down when you have serious conservative opposition. They can be still an indicator, however, of momentum. The FBI (Photo credit: Hurricane Bianca) 
I have heard of October surprises , indeed the Democrats sprang one over Bimbogate, or at least gave it the good old college try. It might have been better choosing bimbos who had actually met the Republican candidate, or at least met him without witnesses present, but there it is. 
Having the FBI act with integrity when the suspect is the Democratic candidate for president and polling day is less than two weeks away wasn’t so much an October surprise as an October shock, no offense to the Fibbies intended. 
Assuming – just assuming – that this wasn’t part of a deal between Mr O and Mr T, whereby Mr T agreed to keep quiet about Mr O’s Kenyan/Zanzibari origins in exchange for Mr O backing off the FBI, the timing of the FBI’s move was extraordinary. They are saying that it was due to fresh evidence coming into their possession, so it can’t have been that. 
It is just possible that the boys in the Hoover building (that’s Hoover as in J Edgar, BTW, not as in the vacuum cleaner) were not aware of the large sums of money slushing, sorry finding, its way to the wife of their Deputy Director from the Clintons. It’s a bit of a mystery, and I don’t pretend to know the answer. Astonishing as it may sound, with respect, it may even be that the FBI have finally started to act with integrity and good faith. If so, that would be a positive development, although don’t expect the CIA to follow suit! If they did, the world really will have turned upside down. The CIA and Wikipedia WWI 
People sometimes ask me why I write for VeteransToday, given the lousy pay (!) The short answer is that they are good people and don’t interfere with my freedom of expression. VT is also something of an intelligence clearing house, however. I hope readers learn something from my weekly columns (that’s why I write ‘em), but I also learn things. 
One of the things I learnt this week via VT is that the CIA have a thing going with Wikipedia. I thought I was dealing with operatives – it was strange that so-called volunteer editors responded within minutes to any attempt by me to balance the Wikipedia attack piece on me. Turns out the CIA have an active interest in about 10% of Wiki sites, including mine. 
Given that Director Brennan is an enemy of mine, with Jesuit connections, I helped expose the role of the Jesuit Order in providing the pretext for World War I and the Agency are heavily penetrated by my bitter enemies the DVD, via the Correa/COREA Group in Frankfurt, that would make sense. 
The next installment in my WikiWar should be mediation. Goodness knows who they’ll suggest as a mediator – Angela Merkel probably, or the President of the European Commission. The mediator will definitely be driving a Volkswagen. The Naval Race Rear Admiral Sir Christoper Cradock 
I’m inter alia an intelligence historian , so it’s nice to turn to an historical topic. It is incredibly important to get history right – otherwise we just repeat the same mistakes. 
A number of commenters last week seemed to be laboring under the delusion, no offense intended, that World War I was started by the naval race between the British and German Empires. This nonsensical view, widely propagated since 1918 by German Intelligence and their allies, is still recycled on the BBC and by liberal faculty members, i.e. just about all of them. 
World War I was not started by the British Admiralty, nor by accident. It was started by the Germans, who set up the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his lovely wife Sophie on June 28th 1914. The German army was already mobilising, implementing a war plan drawn up years before. 
The build-up of the Imperial German Navy had similarly been underway for years, for purely offensive purposes. The German Navy was not designed to protect German interests abroad – its capital ships lacked the range and the habitability for that. It was aimed at bringing the Royal Navy’s Atlantic and Channel Fleets to battle in the North Sea (the famous Grand Fleet was only formed on the outbreak of war). 
There is no way the German Navy could have matched the rapid, hemispheric deployment of a battlecruiser squadron to the farthest reaches of the South Atlantic in 1914, e.g., after the destruction of a weak British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock at the Battle of Coronel. Vice-Admiral Sturdee’s great victory in the Battle of the Falkland Islands was of course made possible by the Naval Intelligence Department. 
The boys had spotted that the First Sea Lord, von Battenberg, was a German spy and had deliberately refused to reinforce Cradock’s squadron. Von Battenberg was left in place and fed false position reports – no wonder the sight of the fighting tops of a British battlecruiser squadron in Port Stanley harbor so rattled the Hun commander, Graf von Spee, who was the runner-up in the battle which followed. The true position was stated millennia ago by the Roman general Vegetius: si vis pacem, para bellum. If you wan’t peace, prepare for war. Great Britain did not encourage the First World War by taking the limited steps that she did to prepare for it. 
We needed more battleships and battlecruisers, not fewer. Sadly, the Liberal government decided to encourage German aggression by holding back spending on the Royal Navy. Had we been stronger, the Hun would not dare have invaded Belgium and Luxembourg in a flanking attack on the French army. Next Myth HMS Barham 
The next myth propagated last week was that battleships were vulnerable to U-Boats. The truth is that the only British battleships sunk by U-Boat in both world wars, HMS Barham and HMS Royal Oak, were betrayed. 
Royal Oak was sunk because the First Sea Lord Sir Dudley Pound was being blackmailed by Jerry and agreed to hold up the badly-needed block-ships requested for Scapa Flow by the C-in-C Home Fleet. 
Had the block-ships been in place, as requested, Gunther Prien wouldn’t have got within five miles of Royal Oak. It is not even clear that the dear old Barham was actually sunk in November 1941 by U-331. It is more likely that her magazines were detonated by a radio-controlled IED set off by a German agent on the battleship ahead, which happened to have a cameraman ready to film the sinking. 
All battleships after the turbine-powered Dreadnought were too fast for submarines, which until the advent of the first true submarine, the German Type XXI, had limited underwater speed and endurance. Forget the headline figure for underwater speed – at top speed a U-Boat’s batteries would be drained quickly. This made achieving a firing solution difficult. Battleships were also usually too well screened by destroyers. 
They were such difficult targets that in practice only a U-Boat lying in wait could torpedo them. Then there was the difficulty in sinking them. Older battleships could indeed be sunk by a single submarine, even a single torpedo, ditto battleships whose design was held back by the absurd limitations in the Washington Treaty, designed to make the next world war winnable for the Bad Guys. 
It is, however, intellectually dishonest to compare the latest subs with older battleships, or battleships, like the King George V class, designed to artificial limits. In World War II modern battleships designed without reference to the Washington Treaty, such as the wonderful Iowa class, incorporated excellent anti-torpedo protection. A single Jap sub, e.g. would have had trouble hitting an Iowa class fast battleship with enough torpedoes to sink her. 
The King George V classic were a classic illustration of the dangers posed by the Washington Treaty. To save weight their outer prop-shafts weren’t armored, a weakness which proved fatal when HMS Prince of Wales was struck by a Japanese aerial torpedo in December 1941. In practice battleships were much less vulnerable to torpedo attack than any other type of warship. That is why all Japanese submarine attacks on American battleships in World War II failed, indeed the Japs only ever managed to sink American battleships in harbor in peacetime, and even then they only actually sank two. The other battleships damaged at Pearl Harbor were repaired, modernised and went on to avenge their sisters. Third Myth HMS Repulse 
The vulnerability of battleships to air attack in World War II has also been greatly overstated. They were of course invulnerable to air attack in World War I, as no aircraft could carry an armor-piercing bomb heavy enough to sink them. No German or Italian battleship was sunk at sea by airpower in the whole of the war. 
No American battleship was sunk at sea in either war, period. Only one British battleship, HMS Prince of Wales, was sunk by airpower in World War II, and she was betrayed. HMS Indomitable, the carrier designated as her escort, had been run aground, on Pound’s orders, whilst working up out of Kingston Harbour in Jamaica. 
Attacking as they did outside fighter range, without combat equipment such self-sealing tanks, the Jap bombers would have been very vulnerable to Indomitable’s cannon-equipped fighters. 
As I explain in Spyhunter, Force Z’s course had been betrayed to the Japanese in Saigon, via radio, by the German spy Rear-Admiral Palliser. Had Palliser not betrayed the British squadron it’s unlikely that the Japs would have found them. They had poor air reconnaissance, limited fuel reserves and could not just stooge around the South China Sea trying to find them. 
HMS Repulse was a battlecruiser, not a battleship. Unlike her sister Renown, she had not been modernised. In particular, she lacked Renown’s modern 4.5” Dual Purpose (DP) battery, much more effective in the AA role than Prince of Wales’s DP fit. Bismarck firing at HMS Hood 
HMS Hood , blown-up during the course of the Battle of the Denmark Strait, was also a battlecruiser and, like Repulse, she had not been modernised. The Chamberlain government and the Treasury denied the Admiralty the funds for her much-needed modernisation, precisely in order to make her easier for Jerry to sink. 
As I explain in Spyhunter, it is very doubtful that Hood was actually sunk by KMS Bismarck and much more likely that she was blown up by an IED in either a 4” magazine, leading to secondary detonation of a main magazine, or a main magazine. 
None of the broadsides fired by either Bismarck or her accompanying heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen is a good candidate for the alleged fatal shot. Prinz Eugen’s main battery was only 8”/60 caliber – her 270 lb shells were too small to have penetrated Hood’s heavy belt armor. 
For decades, we have been favored with nonsense from pro-Germans about Hood’s main deck armor being much weaker than Bismarck’s (the true figures are 3” over the magazines for Hood and 4.7” for Bismarck) and Bismarck sinking her with plunging fire at long range. Bismarck, however, was photographed firing at Hood from the Prinz Eugen. As you can see from the photo, Bismarck’s main battery is nowhere near maximum elevation. 
The Hun-loving editors of Wikipedia, BTW, still cannot bring themselves to acknowledge that the Bismarck was sunk by the Royal Navy. She was in fact finished off by torpedoes from the heavy cruiser HMS Dorsetshire, sinking shortly after the last torpedo hit, which Wikipedia would have us believe was a strange coincidence. HMS King George V 
As I have mentioned, the King George V class , of which Prince of Wales was a member, suffered from design limitations imposed by the Washington Treaty. They also suffered from several design flaws, which would not have been repeated in later classes and partly flowed from the lack of cash given to the Admiralty in the 1930s. 
They sacrificed AA firepower for spotter aircraft. Whilst the planes were well-protected in an armored hangar, it would have been better to rely on more powerful spotter/recon aircraft flown from escorting carriers. 
The 5.25” DP secondary armament was an excellent anti-destroyer weapon, probably the best ever deployed on a battleship, but had too poor a rate of fire (around 12-16 rounds per minute) to be an effective weapon against aircraft. The dedicated AA gun, the multiple 2-pounder ‘pom-pom’, was the best in the world when it came into service in the late 1920s, but had been overtaken by the 40-mil Bofors. The mounts were not tri-axially stabilized and the class lacked tachymetric AA fire-control. These specific weaknesses however afford no grounds for saying that battleships generally were unduly vulnerable to aircraft. So far to the contrary, they were better able to stand up to bombs and torpedoes than carriers, were more stable gun platforms, had better firing arcs (this was particularly true of the US Navy – the Iowa class had superb firing arcs for their secondary and AA armament, e.g., whereas the firing arcs on the Essex-class carriers were limited) and better fire-control. Unsurprisingly, US fast carrier task forces in the Pacific used battleships to protect carriers against aircraft. HMS Inflexible 
Of the five British capital ships sunk during World War II, two were unmodernised battlecruisers, two were probably sunk by IEDs and all five were betrayed in one way, shape or form. Without the assistance of the Abwehr, including interference by political assets in Number 10, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury with their design or modernisation, probably none of them would have been sunk at all. 
The US Navy had the right idea. What was needed was balanced all-arms task forces, combining battlewagons, carriers, cruisers and destroyers. Admiral Henderson of the Royal Navy had in fact come up with the idea of fast carrier task forces protected by capital ships in the Mediterranean in the 1930s, but the Royal Navy lacked enough fast battleships and carriers to really make it work until 1945, with the British Pacific Fleet 
Oh yes, we were in the Pacific alright , although the lack of defense expenditure and serious planning for war by pro-German weanies in Downing St before the war meant that it took three years for us to get there. Apart that is from our fine armored carrier HMS Victorious, which served briefly in the Pacific in 1943, flying USN squadrons, an episode which would make a fine war movie, if a movie-maker could be found with the guts to make it. 
President Reagan also had the right idea in reactivating the Iowa class in the 80s. Had the Royal Navy not been forced to scrap HMS Vanguard, our last battleship, by the German asset Harold Macmillan, it is doubtful that General Galtieri would even have started the war. HMS Vanguard Falklands War 
The very thought of that elegant and powerful fast battleship , virtually immune from the Exocet sea-skimming missiles (her belt armor was too strong for an Exocet to penetrate) emerging from the gloom of the South Atlantic to pulverise the Argentine Fleet or smash up Argentine forces ashore, would have given the Argies the willies. Vanguard’s deck armor, BTW, would have been too strong for any bomb the Argentine Air Force could carry. 
No ship in the Argentine Navy could have remained operational after a single accurate broadside from HMS Vanguard, and she had fully-synthetic fire-control, i.e. could land her main battery guns on target whilst maneuvering. She was a formidable surface combatant. This Week’s Movie Review: Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016, dir. Edward Zwick) 
This movie is huge fun . The first Jack Reacher movie, also starring Tom Cruise, was also huge fun, with the Bad Guys getting whacked all over the place. It’s always nice to see dirty cops getting their come-uppance! We could do with Jack Reacher in Thames Valley. No jury would convict. 
Unusually for a sequel, this movie is as good as the original. If anything, it’s even better. Tom Cruise is excellent as the lead, although it was a disappointment for me that Robert Duvall was not retained. He’s one of my all-time favorite actors. Robert Knepper, as General Harkness, provides strong support, however, as does Cobie Smulders, who I think we’ll be seeing again. 
The plot, based around bent military contractors, is more believable than most of the anti-military, anti-American rubbish emerging from liberal Hollywood, and the heroes come from the military. The movie moves at a cracking pace, and you are kept in suspense until the end about whether Jack is a father or not. I’m not going to spoil it for you by revealing the plot! It’s well worth going to see.",1

By KiMi Robinson Robert Scheer and Thomas Frank. 
Thomas Frank’s writing about electoral politics and and its impact on American culture has been published for decades in places like Harper’s Magazine, The Wall Street Journal and his 2004 novel, “What’s the Matter with Kansas?” In his latest book, “Listen Liberal: Whatever Happened to the Party of the People?” the journalist and political analyst tackles the question of what changed within the Democratic party to make it become a “ liberalism of the rich .” 
“The Democratic Party itself has changed,” Frank told Truthdig Editor in Chief Robert Scheer during an episode of “ Scheer Intelligence ” this year. “What’s changed about them is the social class that they answer to, that they respect, that they come from.” 
The trend has gotten worse. 
“Democrats look at Wall Street, and they see people like themselves,” he said in an interview with Scheer during the Democratic National Convention in July.

On Tuesday night, Frank will join Scheer at the University of Southern California to discuss “Listen Liberal” and his analysis of Hillary Clinton during this election cycle, from her public views on inequality in United States to her promises to tamp down greed on Wall Street. The conversation will be live streamed on our Facebook page at around 7 p.m. PDT. 
In March, Frank summarized his complex investigation of the Democratic Party and the answers he found: 
And you know, we call it inequality; it is the one great problem that we have. And so my, the question in the book is […] the Democrats have been talking about inequality forever. This is why they exist as a party, is to take this on. Why haven’t they been able to do anything about it? And the answer isn’t what you think. You know, it’s not just because Republicans are so diabolically clever and stop them all the time. And it’s also not just because of the money that is sloshing around in politics, although that’s […] a huge part of the story. But the answer is because the Democrats aren’t who we think they are. You know, they talk about inequality, but their heart really isn’t in it. Income inequality is really not something that they have cared about for a very long time. You know, there are individuals here and there who do, but you talk about people like the Clintons—I mean, Hillary Clinton, her concern for inequality is, this is, I would say is almost completely feigned.

20746,20746,"For Paul Ryan, a Long, Labored Path Leading Away From Donald Trump - The New York Times",Jennifer Steinhauer,"WASHINGTON  —   He didn’t see it coming. Speaker Paul D. Ryan was in a hotel room in Cincinnati last May when he learned that Donald J. Trump  —   a man he barely knew, with no institutional ties to his party and a mouth that had already clacked his nerves  —   had secured the Republican nomination for president. Mr. Trump had recently lost the Wisconsin primary, which Mr. Ryan and other Republicans in the state thought would presage the reality television star’s demise. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas had made strides, and Mr. Ryan thought the campaign would snake into the summer. But he badly miscalculated. The ensuing path, from Mr. Trump’s securing the nomination to Mr. Ryan’s decision not to have the nominee appear with him at a rally in Wisconsin a month before Election Day, has been jagged and treacherous, marked by brief moments of hope that Mr. Trump could be controlled, followed by the sinking realization that he could not. Mr. Ryan heard the persistent  —   at times desperate  —   appeals of Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee and a fellow Wisconsinite, and the angry calls from his rank and file, and neither could move him closer to Mr. Trump. Now, Mr. Ryan finds himself in a singular abyss, desperate to maintain the voter enthusiasm needed to preserve Republican control of Congress, yet unable to defend his party’s presidential nominee. If Mr. Trump is defeated on Nov. 8  —   as Mr. Ryan has all but conceded  —   but Republicans maintain their House majority, it will fall largely to Mr. Ryan to piece the rubble of his party back together. There is, of course, the question of whether House members would let him do so. The Republicans’ crisis would have an early reckoning with the House decision on whether the speaker should be Mr. Ryan  —   whose beliefs in free trade, tolerance toward immigration, changes to entitlement programs and conservative governance have long been Republican orthodoxy  —   or a new brand of leader who embodies Trumpism. Democrats have moved quickly to paint Mr. Ryan as spineless and calculating for not outright rescinding his endorsement of Mr. Trump, while the right flank in his own party has taken a polar opposite view, saying Mr. Ryan should not publicly criticize the nominee. On Saturday, Mr. Ryan’s office added to that criticism of Mr. Trump, if indirectly, trying to tamp down the nominee’s talk of a “rigged” election. “Our democracy relies on confidence in election results, and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity,” said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan. For his part, Mr. Trump has been unsparing in his disparagement of Mr. Ryan. Last week, in a series of Twitter posts, he called Mr. Ryan “our very weak and ineffective leader,” who was lending “zero support” and “should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee. ” For now, the speaker spends his days treating Mr. Trump like a disgruntled former employee bent on Twitter revenge, essentially ignoring him. Instead, he gives speeches about the   tax credit and the evils of Hillary Clinton, while furiously raising money for suddenly endangered House Republicans. “Right now his objective is crystal clear,” said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, “to retain the Republican majority in the House. In that effort he has helped members of the Freedom Caucus as well as those in the Tuesday Group and everyone in between,” he said, referring to the most conservative and most moderate members. “We will worry about our internal differences after the election. Right now we are in a bar fight and every Republican is worth saving. ” That Mr. Ryan and Mr. Trump were never natural allies is understandable. They had met only once before the business tycoon decided to run for the White House, an encounter at a   in New York during the 2012 campaign. Mr. Ryan was Mitt Romney’s running mate. Their paths would not cross again. “Trump really wasn’t on Paul’s radar screen,” said A. Mark Neuman, a Ryan friend for two decades. “Before this presidential race, there was almost no intersection in their lives,” he said, noting that Mr. Trump did not share Mr. Ryan’s passions for the Green Bay Packers, hunting, church, intense workouts and Midwest life with children. The relationship showed strains from the start, with Mr. Ryan alarmed by Mr. Trump’s   rhetoric and nationalistic appeals. The speaker decided to offer a policy agenda with no connection to Mr. Trump for other Republicans to embrace, a move almost   during a presidential campaign. “If we try to play our own version of identity politics and try to fuel ourselves based on darker emotions, that’s not productive,” he said. He made calls to several of the Republican presidential candidates to outline the agenda Mr. Trump feigned mild interest but they did not speak again. (The Trump campaign did not return emails with questions for this article. Mr. Ryan also declined to be interviewed.) Mr. Ryan had hoped that Mr. Trump would eventually embrace his plan. When Mr. Trump clinched the nomination in May, Mr. Ryan was rattled, said several people who talked to him that day. “The conventional wisdom among the people we talked to here was, ‘Don’t worry, this will end,’” said Charlie Sykes, a former conservative talk radio host in Milwaukee and a friend of Mr. Ryan’s. “So it was a huge shock. I think a lot of us here believed we were going be the firewall in Wisconsin, that there would be an outbreak of rationality. ” With campaign rhetoric getting increasingly contentious, Mr. Ryan made the unusual choice of announcing that he was not ready to endorse Mr. Trump. None of this pleased Mr. Priebus, who prided himself on building the modern Republican Party in Wisconsin and longed for unity going into the race against Mrs. Clinton. In text messages and phone calls, Mr. Priebus tried to persuade Mr. Ryan  —   who was relishing his independence  —   to accept Mr. Trump, said numerous officials with knowledge of the exchanges who requested anonymity to discuss internal party matters. Mr. Trump would yell at Mr. Priebus and in turn Mr. Priebus would needle Mr. Ryan. When that did not work, Mr. Trump claimed Mr. Ryan had agreed to endorse him before a visit to Capitol Hill to try to woo fellow Republicans, a claim Mr. Ryan viewed as a serious breach. “That was the first realization that Trump wasn’t just a public persona,” said a Republican involved in planning the meeting, who insisted on anonymity so as not to alienate Mr. Trump, “but that his staff does not deal in good faith. ” In June, after a period of relative silence on Mr. Trump’s part, Mr. Ryan finally felt comfortable enough to endorse him. Staff members of both men began to coordinate for the Republican National Convention. But days later Mr. Ryan aggressively criticized Mr. Trump for his remarks about a Hispanic judge. Another outburst, and another brick on the wall was laid. “He was genuinely just outraged after all those comments,” Mr. Sykes said. A bright spot came in July, when Mr. Trump chose Indiana’s governor, Mike Pence, who has long been close to Mr. Ryan, as his running mate. Privately, Mr. Pence tried to assure skeptical Republicans that he would impose Mr. Ryan’s policy agenda if he and Mr. Trump captured the White House. Then in August, Mr. Trump toyed with endorsing Mr. Ryan’s opponent in a primary. Mr. Ryan, for his part, went on with his summer, serving as the chairman at the convention, where his role was unusually diminished. He watched Mr. Trump’s acceptance speech from a sky box. Mr. Trump called Mr. Ryan a handful of times after the convention, once to tell him about his choice of Mr. Pence, and to seek debate advice, which Mr. Ryan said focused on preparation. (Not heeded.) By the fall, Mr. Ryan had basically stopped speaking Mr. Trump’s name. The nominee made a request through the R. N. C. to campaign with Mr. Ryan, whose team agreed to invite Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence to an event this month in Wisconsin. Then came the tape of Mr. Trump making vulgar and lewd comments about women in 2005. Mr. Sykes let Mr. Priebus know via text that Mr. Trump was no longer welcome in Wisconsin. Mr. Sykes said Mr. Priebus responded: “I am the guy trying to fix this! I am in tears over this. ’” (A spokeswoman for Mr. Priebus acknowledged that he was upset, but denied any tears.) Mr. Ryan agonized over his options. Ultimately, he chose not to withdraw his endorsement to keep Republicans motivated to vote, which still angered some of his conference. “I think they ask far too much of the speaker,” said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, who has renounced Mr. Trump. “His job is to help House Republicans. Period. ” Mr. Ryan will soon find out if those members of his party who support Mr. Trump might come after him in the next speaker election. “We knew they had extreme views and you kind of rolled your eyes and said they were on our team,” Mr. Sykes said. “How much damage could they do?”",0

20749,20749,Realities Faced by Black Canadians are a National Shame,Anonymous,"Tweet Widget by Robyn Maynard 
Canada, including its French-speaking regions, is home to much the same kind of systemic racism as its southern neighbor, according to a United Nations Working Group report. Black women’s poverty rates are “almost five times higher than that of white Canadian women.” In Montreal, “a 2008 study found that black girls are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more.” Realities Faced by Black Canadians are a National Shame by Robyn Maynard 
This article previously appeared in the Montreal Gazette . 
“ Black Montrealers continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions.” 
After holding consultations in Quebec, Nova Scotia and Ontario last month, the United Nations Working Group on People of African Descent issued a statement that sheds light on realities, too-often invisible to most Canadians, that should be seen as a national shame. 
The group’s preliminary findings confirm what is already well known in Canada’s black communities: that systemic discrimination has subjected black people to racial profiling by law enforcement, soaring incarceration rates, disproportionate poverty and poor health, the over-apprehension of black children by child welfare agencies and lower graduation rates. Black women, they note, face a rate of poverty that is almost five times higher than that of white Canadian women, and are one of the fastest-growing groups in federal prisons. 
Underlying these injustices, the UN Working Group has made clear, is systemic racism. 
The UN is right to be concerned, and Montreal is by no means exempt from this criticism: Both its historical and contemporary realities are defined by a systemic anti-blackness that goes too frequently un-named. The enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834. The fact of slavery remains all around us: acclaimed art historian Charmaine Nelson reminds us that many present-day Montreal streets, buildings and institutions are named after white businessmen like James McGill and John Redpath who traded in plantation crops worked by slave labor. 
Enslavement may be over, but centuries later black Montrealers — the largest visible minority in the city — continue to experience dehumanizing treatment across institutions. A 2010 study by sociologists Léonel Bernard and Christopher McAll found that it was over-surveillance, and not the rates of so-called “black crime,” that accounted for up to 60 per cent of the over-incarceration of black youth in Montreal. 
“The enslavement of black (and indigenous) persons was not an uncommon practice in New France, and indeed was legal until 1834.” 
A report commissioned by the Montreal police, leaked to La Presse, found that in St-Michel and Montréal-Nord, up to 40 per cent of black youth were stopped in 2006-2007, a rate that indicates a high degree of racial profiling by police officers. Much of this heightened policing was justified to the public as curbing “gang activities,” when in reality, in 2009, only 1.6 per cent of crimes were gang related. High profile cases of police abuse of black Montrealers and alleged abuse continue to surface, including the recent case of Veckqueth Stevenson, a legally blind black man in his 50s, who has accused the police of using excessive force and unjustly arresting him, ironically, while he was at Nelson Mandela Park. 
Black women and girls are not exempt, though we hear even less about their experiences locally; the case of Majiza Philip, a black woman who says she had her arm broken by police in 2014, is one example, however. A 2008 study found that black girls in Montreal are three times more likely than white girls the same age to have been arrested two times or more. 
Beyond the criminal justice system, numerous studies have demonstrated that black children are apprehended from their homes by child welfare at alarming rates in Montreal, and this, too, can be attributed to racism. 
The UN Working group is not the first to point out these injustices, nor are they the only ones proposing solutions. Black Lives Matter-Toronto and other black activist groups in Toronto, Kingston, Ottawa, Vancouver and Montreal have been steadily mobilizing to address anti-black racism. Across cities, black communities have denounced, among other issues, the recent deaths of Abdirahman Abdi in Ottawa, and Bony Jean-Pierre in Montreal, both at the hands of police in 2016. 
If Canada intends to genuinely reckon with its still-living legacy of black enslavement, the injustices brought to light by the UN — alongside those highlighted by black activists around the country — need to be both addressed and redressed.

20751,20751,Bill Clinton’s ‘Son’ Danney Williams has Youtube Channel Restored,Infowars.com,"Bill Clinton’s ‘Son’ Danney Williams has Youtube Channel Restored Youtube had deactivated channel hosting popular documentary linking Williams to Bill Clinton Infowars.com - October 27, 2016 Comments 
Youtube has decided to reverse its ban on a channel registered by a man who claims to be Bill Clinton’s long-lost son. 
“Your YouTube account was suspended due to repeated or severe violations of our Terms and our Community Guidelines, and as such cannot be restored,” the company wrote earlier this week to Danney Williams after he filed an appeal to restore his channel. 
For decades, Williams has been on a mission to reunite with the person he believes to be his biological father, the 42nd President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton. 
The most popular video on the channel , a nine-minute mini-documentary posted two weeks ago produced by filmmaker Joel Gilbert, features the 30-year-old Williams recounting memories from his childhood which prompted the search for his father. 
Arguing the channel had “absolutely zero violations of any kind,” Gilbert places blame for the suspension squarely at Google and the Clinton campaign’s feet. 
“It’s obvious to me that the fix is in!” Gilbert wrote in a statement. “The only possible explanation is that the Clinton campaign requested YouTube/Google to silence Danny, ‘to run him off the plantation’ as Danny said Hillary Clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the Arkansas Governor’s mansion in 1990.” 
Youtube later restored Williams’ channel early Thursday morning claiming a review confirmed it was not in violation of its Terms of Service. 
Last week, Danney went to Las Vegas – the site of the third US presidential debate – where he held a press conference alongside his lawyers announcing his intention to seek a DNA sample from Bill Clinton in order to settle the paternity dispute. 
Danney and his lawyers claim a previous DNA test carried out by the tabloid Star Magazine failed to obtain a blood sample from Clinton, an assertion confirmed by one of Star’s former editors to World Net Daily . 
“I don’t remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on Clinton’s DNA,” former Star Magazine editor Phil Bunton stated to WND.

20752,20752,"A Presidential Golf Outing, With a Twist: Trump Owns the Place - The New York Times",Julie Hirschfeld Davis,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   Black plastic covered the doors and windows in an ornate suite at one of President Trump’s resorts on Saturday, as he bonded with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan over a round of golf on a pristine day. The covering blocked American and Japanese journalists from capturing a glimpse of the leaders on the lush private course in Jupiter, Fla. But Mr. Trump’s aides snapped their own picture of the friendly tableau, posting a photo of the men sharing a   with an American flag waving majestically in the distance, to the president’s social media accounts for his millions of followers to see. “Having a great time hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the United States!” Mr. Trump’s post said. This, after all, was the point of inviting Mr. Abe to his    resort in Palm Beach: a chance to have a   weekend hosting a foreign leader with whom he has said he wants to develop a close relationship. It allowed Mr. Trump to capitalize on some unscripted moments after an initial period in office marred by antagonistic exchanges with some foreign leaders. The news media blackout was nothing unusual in the annals of presidential free time. President Barack Obama routinely played golf out of sight of the press pool that traveled with him, only occasionally allowing a glimpse of him taking a swing or interacting with his partners. But it was the latest reminder that Mr. Trump’s presidency is mixing his official role with the business that bears his name. Mr. Abe’s visit was the first of what Mr. Trump’s top aides say will be many in which he uses    the     and   castle on Florida’s Gold Coast, as a setting for forging   relationships with important world leaders. That is likely to mean that the property  —   along with Trump golf courses nearby in Jupiter and West Palm Beach, where the president squired Mr. Abe on Saturday, along with the professional golfer Ernie Els  —   will draw increased attention and prominence, with all the potential for additional profit that brings.    has doubled its initiation rate for new members, to $200, 000. “We got to know each other very, very well” on the golf course, Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday evening as he stood beside Mr. Abe and their wives on the way to dinner at   . Nearby, a line of clubgoers in formal wear maneuvered Bentleys and   into the driveway as a full moon rose over the palm trees. The administration said that Mr. Trump was hosting Mr. Abe and his wife as a “gift” to the Japanese leader and has said that any profits earned from the stays of members of foreign governments at Trump properties during his presidency would be donated to the United States Treasury, to avoid the appearance that he was cashing in on his office. It may be a frequent arrangement. Mr. Trump, his aides say, believes in getting to know foreign leaders with whom he will be spending time and taking their measure in informal settings outside Washington. “President Trump is a deal maker, and his coin of the realm is personal relationships and trying to convince people to negotiate a certain way in his favor, so this is what he does,” Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has studied presidential travel, said. Mr. Trump is not the first president to make use of a personal retreat to engage in informal diplomacy. George W. Bush hosted foreign leaders at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, while Bill Clinton used Camp David, the official presidential retreat near Thurmont, Md. as an informal backdrop for   diplomacy, including efforts to forge peace in the Middle East. But for Mr. Trump, his retreat is also a   club that benefits his family business, from which he has declined to divest. “It’s just one more example of using public office for private gain,” Richard W. Painter, a White House counsel to Mr. Bush who is an expert on government ethics, said. “He’s going to Trump this, Trump that  —   it’s clearly designed to raise the value of the brand and send the message to foreign leaders that you ought to patronize Trump properties if you want to get in good with the president. ” On Saturday, Mr. Trump appeared to have taken some steps to separate the personal from the political. While Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe shuttled from resort to resort in the armored presidential limousine known as the Beast, the flags that normally flutter on the front and the presidential seals that usually adorn the doors were absent, an indication that these were not official stops. There were other reminders that the visit was unfolding almost exclusively on Mr. Trump’s own turf. At the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, journalists traveling with him were admonished not to take pictures or video. “It’s a private club,” an aide explained.",0
20753,20753,Donald Trump’s Self-Funding Includes Payments to Family and His Companies - The New York Times,Alan Rappeport,"Donald J. Trump regularly boasts that he is   his presidential bid, but new campaign finance filings show that he is also shifting plenty of money back to himself in the process. According to documents submitted to the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Trump, whose campaign has just $1. 3 million cash on hand, paid at least $1. 1 million to his businesses and family members in May for expenses associated with events and travel costs. The total represents nearly a fifth of the $6 million that his campaign spent in the month. The spending raised eyebrows among campaign finance experts and some of Mr. Trump’s critics who have questioned whether the presumptive Republican nominee, who points to his business acumen as a case for his candidacy, is trying to do what he has suggested he would in 2000 when he mulled making an independent run: “It’s very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it. ” “He could end up turning a profit if he repaid himself for the campaign loans,” said Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance expert with the Campaign Legal Center. “He could get all his money back plus the profit margin for what his campaign has paid himself for goods and services. ” While most candidates list an array of vendors providing goods and services on their filings, Mr. Trump’s is packed with payments to his various clubs and buildings, his fleet of planes and his family. The   billionaire is required by law to account for his spending this way to prevent his companies from making illegal corporate donations to his campaign. In 2015, about $2. 7 million was paid to at least seven companies Mr. Trump owns or to people who work for his real estate and branding empire, repaying them for services provided to his campaign. In May, the   item was Mr. Trump’s use of the    Club, his Florida resort, which was paid $423, 000. The campaign paid $350, 000 to TAG Air for his private airplanes, $125, 000 to Trump Restaurants and more than $170, 000 to Trump Tower, the Manhattan skyscraper that houses the campaign’s headquarters. Mr. Trump’s family also profited from the campaign last month, with his son Eric’s Virginia wine business taking in about $1, 300. And Mr. Trump, who has said he will not take a salary if he is elected president, paid himself $3, 085 in May. The disbursements are related to travel expenses, according to the filings. Mr. Ryan said that the extent to which Mr. Trump was utilizing his own businesses for his run was unprecedented and that because of his unique financial circumstances, he was wading into territory that went beyond the commission’s guidance. “We don’t have clear answers,” Mr. Ryan said. “Historically, candidates would separate themselves from their business interests when running for office. Trump has done the opposite by promoting his businesses while running for office. ” While candidates often gain recognition from running for president, they are barred from enriching themselves directly from their campaigns. When a campaign buys copies of a candidate’s book in bulk and distributes them, for example, the candidate cannot accept royalties from the purchases. However, Mr. Ryan notes that the election commission does allow candidates who own commercial property to rent it from themselves at fair market rates, as Mr. Trump has regularly done. Mr. Trump’s use of his branded water and steaks falls into something of a gray area. Ciara   an election law expert at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said that Mr. Trump did not appear to be violating any campaign finance laws, but that he could face more scrutiny over the use of his businesses for campaign purposes now that he is more explicitly asking supporters to donate money to the campaign. “It is something to keep an eye on,” she said, “because as soon as you start using campaign money that has come in from donors, not just the money that he has loaned to himself, and he uses it for something that he will personally keep, or his family will personally keep, that is what crosses the line. ” Whether Mr. Trump could end up profiting from his campaign remains a subject of speculation some have questioned if he will eventually ask for the more than $40 million that he has lent to his campaign to be repaid. The eventual effect of the campaign on Mr. Trump’s personal brand, which he has said represents a large part of his wealth, also remains unclear. Democrats on Tuesday tried to seize on the payments Mr. Trump made to his businesses as evidence of hypocrisy. Commenters on the liberal website Daily Kos ridiculed Mr. Trump for running a “scampaign” and overstating the personal investment he was making in his campaign by funneling the money back to his empire. Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee and Mr. Trump’s main rival this fall, also piled on, taking to Twitter on Tuesday to jab him over the expenditures and his relatively paltry   sum in one swipe. “What is Trump spending his meager campaign resources on?” she said. “Why, himself, of course. ”",0
20754,20754,No More American Thanksgivings,Glen Ford,"Thanksgiving by Glen Ford 
“The core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores – a national consecration of the unspeakable, a balm and benediction for the victors, a blessing of the fruits of murder and kidnapping, and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day.” No More American Thanksgivings by Glen Ford 
This article originally appeared in the November 27, 2003 , issue of The Black Commentator, which Glen Ford co-founded and edited. 
Nobody but Americans celebrates Thanksgiving. It is reserved by history and the intent of “the founders” as the supremely white American holiday, the most ghoulish event on the national calendar. No Halloween of the imagination can rival the exterminationist reality that was the genesis, and remains the legacy, of the American Thanksgiving. It is the most loathsome, humanity-insulting day of the year – a pure glorification of racist barbarity. 
We at are thankful that the day grows nearer when the almost four centuries-old abomination will be deprived of its reason for being: white supremacy. Then we may all eat and drink in peace and gratitude for the blessings of humanity’s deliverance from the rule of evil men. 
Thanksgiving is much more than a lie – if it were that simple, an historical correction of the record of events in 1600s Massachusetts would suffice to purge the “flaw” in the national mythology. But Thanksgiving is not just a twisted fable, and the mythology it nurtures is itself inherently evil. The real-life events – subsequently revised – were perfectly understood at the time as the first, definitive triumphs of the genocidal European project in New England. The near-erasure of Native Americans in Massachusetts and, soon thereafter, from most of the remainder of the northern English colonial seaboard was the true mission of the Pilgrim enterprise – Act One of the American Dream. African Slavery commenced contemporaneously – an overlapping and ultimately inseparable Act Two. 
The last Act in the American drama must be the “root and branch” eradication of all vestiges of Act One and Two – America’s seminal crimes and formative projects. Thanksgiving as presently celebrated – that is, as a national political event – is an affront to civilization. 
Celebrating the unspeakable 
White America embraced Thanksgiving because a majority of that population glories in the fruits, if not the unpleasant details, of genocide and slavery and feels, on the whole, good about their heritage: a cornucopia of privilege and national power. Children are taught to identify with the good fortune of the Pilgrims. It does not much matter that the Native American and African holocausts that flowed from the feast at Plymouth are hidden from the children’s version of the story – kids learn soon enough that Indians were made scarce and Africans became enslaved. But they will also never forget the core message of the holiday: that the Pilgrims were good people, who could not have purposely set such evil in motion. Just as the first Thanksgivings marked the consolidation of the English toehold in what became the United States, the core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores – a national consecration of the unspeakable, a balm and benediction for the victors, a blessing of the fruits of murder and kidnapping, and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day. 
The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims – of harsh weather and their own naïve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings – at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims’ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission. 
Thanksgiving is quite dangerous – as were the Pilgrims. 
Rejoicing in a cemetery 
The English settlers, their ostensibly religious venture backed by a trading company, were glad to discover that they had landed in a virtual cemetery in 1620. Corn still sprouted in the abandoned fields of the Wampanoags , but only a remnant of the local population remained around the fabled Rock. In a letter to England, Massachusetts Bay colony founder John Winthrop wrote, ""But for the natives in these parts, God hath so pursued them, as for 300 miles space the greatest part of them are swept away by smallpox which still continues among them. So as God hath thereby cleared our title to this place, those who remain in these parts, being in all not 50, have put themselves under our protection."" 
Ever diligent to claim their own advantages as God’s will, the Pilgrims thanked their deity for having “pursued” the Indians to mass death. However, it was not divine intervention that wiped out most of the natives around the village of Patuxet but, most likely, smallpox-embedded blankets planted during an English visit or slave raid. Six years before the Pilgrim landing, a ship sailed into Patuxet’s harbor, captained by none other than the famous seaman and mercenary soldier John Smith , former leader of the first successful English colony in the New World, at Jamestown, Virginia. Epidemic and slavery followed in his wake, as Debra Glidden described in IMDiversity.com : 
In 1614 the Plymouth Company of England, a joint stock company, hired Captain John Smith to explore land in its behalf. Along what is now the coast of Massachusetts in the territory of the Wampanoag, Smith visited the town of Patuxet according to ""The Colonial Horizon,"" a 1969 book edited by William Goetzinan. Smith renamed the town Plymouth in honor of his employers, but the Wampanoag who inhabited the town continued to call it Patuxet. 
The following year Captain Hunt, an English slave trader, arrived at Patuxet. It was common practice for explorers to capture Indians, take them to Europe and sell them into slavery for 220 shillings apiece. That practice was described in a 1622 account of happenings entitled ""A Declaration of the State of the Colony and Affairs in Virginia,"" written by Edward Waterhouse. True to the explorer tradition, Hunt kidnapped a number of Wampanoags to sell into slavery. 
Another common practice among European explorers was to give ""smallpox blankets"" to the Indians. Since smallpox was unknown on this continent prior to the arrival of the Europeans, Native Americans did not have any natural immunity to the disease so smallpox would effectively wipe out entire villages with very little effort required by the Europeans. William Fenton describes how Europeans decimated Native American villages in his 1957 work ""American Indian and White relations to 1830."" From 1615 to 1619 smallpox ran rampant among the Wampanoags and their neighbors to the north. The Wampanoag lost 70 percent of their population to the epidemic and the Massachusetts lost 90 percent. 
Most of the Wampanoag had died from the smallpox epidemic so when the Pilgrims arrived they found well-cleared fields which they claimed for their own. A Puritan colonist, quoted by Harvard University's Perry Miller, praised the plague that had wiped out the Indians for it was ""the wonderful preparation of the Lord Jesus Christ, by his providence for his people's abode in the Western world."" 
Historians have since speculated endlessly on why the woods in the region resembled a park to the disembarking Pilgrims in 1620. The reason should have been obvious: hundreds, if not thousands, of people had lived there just five years before. 
In less than three generations the settlers would turn all of New England into a charnel house for Native Americans, and fire the economic engines of slavery throughout English-speaking America. Plymouth Rock is the place where the nightmare truly began. 
The uninvited? 
It is not at all clear what happened at the first – and only – “integrated” Thanksgiving feast. Only two written accounts of the three-day event exist, and one of them, by Governor William Bradford, was written 20 years after the fact. Was Chief Massasoit invited to bring 90 Indians with him to dine with 52 colonists, most of them women and children? This seems unlikely. A good harvest had provided the settlers with plenty of food, according to their accounts, so the whites didn’t really need the Wampanoag’s offering of five deer. What we do know is that there had been lots of tension between the two groups that fall. John Two-Hawks, who runs the Native Circle web site, gives a sketch of the facts: 
“Thanksgiving' did not begin as a great loving relationship between the pilgrims and the Wampanoag, Pequot and Narragansett people. In fact, in October of 1621 when the pilgrim survivors of their first winter in Turtle Island sat down to share the first unofficial 'Thanksgiving' meal, the Indians who were there were not even invited! There was no turkey, squash, cranberry sauce or pumpkin pie. A few days before this alleged feast took place, a company of 'pilgrims' led by Miles Standish actively sought the head of a local Indian chief, and an 11 foot high wall was erected around the entire Plymouth settlement for the very purpose of keeping Indians out!” 
It is much more likely that Chief Massasoit either crashed the party, or brought enough men to ensure that he was not kidnapped or harmed by the Pilgrims. Dr. Tingba Apidta, in his “ Black Folks’ Guide to Understanding Thanksgiving ,” surmises that the settlers “brandished their weaponry” early and got drunk soon thereafter. He notes that “each Pilgrim drank at least a half gallon of beer a day, which they preferred even to water. This daily inebriation led their governor, William Bradford, to comment on his people's ‘notorious sin,’ which included their ‘drunkenness and uncleanliness’ and rampant ‘sodomy.’” 
Soon after the feast the brutish Miles Standish “got his bloody prize,” Dr. Apidta writes: 
“He went to the Indians, pretended to be a trader, then beheaded an Indian man named Wituwamat. He brought the head to Plymouth, where it was displayed on a wooden spike for many years, according to Gary B. Nash, ‘as a symbol of white power.’ Standish had the Indian man's young brother hanged from the rafters for good measure. From that time on, the whites were known to the Indians of Massachusetts by the name ‘Wotowquenange,’ which in their tongue meant cutthroats and stabbers.” 
What is certain is that the first feast was not called a “Thanksgiving” at the time; no further integrated dining occasions were scheduled; and the first, official all-Pilgrim “Thanksgiving” had to wait until 1637, when the whites of New England celebrated the massacre of the Wampanoag’s southern neighbors, the Pequots. 
The real Thanksgiving Day Massacre 
The Pequots today own the Foxwood Casino and Hotel , in Ledyard, Connecticut, with gross gaming revenues of over $9 billion in 2000. This is truly a (very belated) miracle, since the real first Pilgrim Thanksgiving was intended as the Pequot’s epitaph. Sixteen years after the problematical Plymouth feast, the English tried mightily to erase the Pequots from the face of the Earth, and thanked God for the blessing. 
Having subdued, intimidated or made mercenaries of most of the tribes of Massachusetts, the English turned their growing force southward, toward the rich Connecticut valley, the Pequot’s sphere of influence. At the point where the Mystic River meets the sea, the combined force of English and allied Indians bypassed the Pequot fort to attack and set ablaze a town full of women, children and old people. 
William Bradford, the former Governor of Plymouth and one of the chroniclers of the 1621 feast, was also on hand for the great massacre of 1637: 
""Those that escaped the fire were slain with the sword; some hewed to pieces, others run through with their rapiers, so that they were quickly dispatched and very few escaped. It was conceived they thus destroyed about 400 at this time. It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fire...horrible was the stink and scent thereof, but the victory seemed a sweet sacrifice, and they gave the prayers thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to enclose their enemies in their hands, and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enemy."" 
The rest of the white folks thought so, too. “This day forth shall be a day of celebration and thanksgiving for subduing the Pequots,"" read Governor John Winthrop’s proclamation. The authentic Thanksgiving Day was born. 
Most historians believe about 700 Pequots were slaughtered at Mystic. Many prisoners were executed, and surviving women and children sold into slavery in the West Indies. Pequot prisoners that escaped execution were parceled out to Indian tribes allied with the English. The Pequot were thought to have been extinguished as a people. According to IndyMedia , “The Pequot tribe numbered 8,000 when the Pilgrims arrived, but disease had brought their numbers down to 1,500 by 1637. The Pequot ‘War’ killed all but a handful of remaining members of the tribe.” 
But there were still too many Indians around to suit the whites of New England, who bided their time while their own numbers increased to critical, murderous mass. 
Guest’s head on a pole 
By the 1670s the colonists, with 8,000 men under arms, felt strong enough to demand that the Pilgrims’ former dinner guests the Wampanoags disarm and submit to the authority of the Crown. After a series of settler provocations in 1675, the Wampanoag struck back, under the leadership of Chief Metacomet, son of Massasoit, called King Philip by the English. Metacomet/Philip, whose wife and son were captured and sold into West Indian slavery, wiped out 13 settlements and killed 600 adult white men before the tide of battle turned. A 1996 issue of the Revolutionary Worker provides an excellent narrative. 
In their victory, the settlers launched an all-out genocide against the remaining Native people. The Massachusetts government offered 20 shillings bounty for every Indian scalp, and 40 shillings for every prisoner who could be sold into slavery. Soldiers were allowed to enslave any Indian woman or child under 14 they could capture. The ""Praying Indians"" who had converted to Christianity and fought on the side of the European troops were accused of shooting into the treetops during battles with ""hostiles."" They were enslaved or killed. Other ""peaceful"" Indians of Dartmouth and Dover were invited to negotiate or seek refuge at trading posts – and were sold onto slave ships. 
It is not known how many Indians were sold into slavery, but in this campaign, 500 enslaved Indians were shipped from Plymouth alone. Of the 12,000 Indians in the surrounding tribes, probably about half died from battle, massacre and starvation. 
After King Philip's War, there were almost no Indians left free in the northern British colonies. A colonist wrote from Manhattan's New York colony: ""There is now but few Indians upon the island and those few no ways hurtful. It is to be admired how strangely they have decreased by the hand of God, since the English first settled in these parts."" In Massachusetts, the colonists declared a ""day of public thanksgiving"" in 1676, saying, ""there now scarce remains a name or family of them [the Indians] but are either slain, captivated or fled."" 
Fifty-five years after the original Thanksgiving Day, the Puritans had destroyed the generous Wampanoag and all other neighboring tribes. The Wampanoag chief King Philip was beheaded. His head was stuck on a pole in Plymouth, where the skull still hung on display 24 years later. 
This is not thought to be a fit Thanksgiving tale for the children of today, but it’s the real story, well-known to the settler children of New England at the time – the white kids who saw the Wampanoag head on the pole year after year and knew for certain that God loved them best of all, and that every atrocity they might ever commit against a heathen, non-white was blessed. 
There’s a good term for the process thus set in motion: nation-building. 
Roots of the slave trade 
The British North American colonists’ practice of enslaving Indians for labor or direct sale to the West Indies preceded the appearance of the first chained Africans at the dock in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1619. The Jamestown colonists’ human transaction with the Dutch vessel was an unscheduled occurrence. However, once the African slave trade became commercially established, the fates of Indians and Africans in the colonies became inextricably entwined. New England, born of up-close-and-personal, burn-them-in-the-fires-of-hell genocide, led the political and commercial development of the English colonies. The region also led the nascent nation’s descent into a slavery-based society and economy. 
Ironically, an apologist for Virginian slavery made one of the best, early cases for the indictment of New England as the engine of the American slave trade. Unreconstructed secessionist Lewis Dabney’s 1867 book “ A Defense of Virginia ” traced the slave trade’s origins all the way back to Plymouth Rock: 
The planting of the commercial States of North America began with the colony of Puritan Independents at Plymouth, in 1620, which was subsequently enlarged into the State of Massachusetts. The other trading colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut, as well as New Hampshire (which never had an extensive shipping interest), were offshoots of Massachusetts. They partook of the same characteristics and pursuits; and hence, the example of the parent colony is taken here as a fair representation of them. 
The first ship from America, which embarked in the African slave trade, was the Desire , Captain Pierce, of Salem; and this was among the first vessels ever built in the colony. The promptitude with which the ""Puritan Fathers"" embarked in this business may be comprehended, when it is stated that the Desire sailed upon her voyage in June, 1637. [Note: the year they massacred the Pequots.] The first feeble and dubious foothold was gained by the white man at Plymouth less than seventeen years before; and as is well known, many years were expended by the struggle of the handful of settlers for existence. So that it may be correctly said, that the commerce of New England was born of the slave trade; as its subsequent prosperity was largely founded upon it. The Desire , proceeding to the Bahamas, with a cargo of ""dry fish and strong liquors, the only commodities for those parts,"" obtained the negroes from two British men-of-war, which had captured them from a Spanish slaver. 
Thus, the trade of which the good ship Desire , of Salem, was the harbinger, grew into grand proportions; and for nearly two centuries poured a flood of wealth into New England, as well as no inconsiderable number of slaves. Meanwhile, the other maritime colonies of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and Connecticut, followed the example of their elder sister emulously; and their commercial history is but a repetition of that of Massachusetts. The towns of Providence, Newport, and New Haven became famous slave trading ports. The magnificent harbor of the second, especially, was the favorite starting-place of the slave ships; and its commerce rivaled, or even exceeded, that of the present commercial metropolis, New York. All the four original States, of course, became slaveholding. 
The Revolution that exploded in 1770s New England was undertaken by men thoroughly imbued with the worldview of the Indian-killer and slave-holder. How could they not be? The “country” they claimed as their own was fathered by genocide and mothered by slavery – its true distinction among the commercial nations of the world. And these men were not ashamed, but proud, with vast ambition to spread their exceptional characteristics West and South and wherever their so-far successful project in nation-building might take them – and by the same bloody, savage methods that had served them so well in the past. 
At the moment of deepest national crisis following the battle of Gettysburg in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln invoked the national fable that is far more central to the white American personality than Lincoln’s battlefield “Address.” Lincoln seized upon the 1621 feast as the historic “Thanksgiving” – bypassing the official and authentic 1637 precedent – and assigned the dateless, murky event the fourth Thursday in November. 
Lincoln surveyed a broken nation, and attempted nation-rebuilding, based on the purest white myth. The same year that he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, he renewed the national commitment to a white manifest destiny that began at Plymouth Rock. Lincoln sought to rekindle a shared national mission that former Confederates and Unionists and white immigrants from Europe could collectively embrace. It was and remains a barbaric and racist national unifier, by definition. Only the most fantastic lies can sanitize the history of the Plymouth Colony of Massachusetts. 
”Like a rock” 
The Thanksgiving holiday fable is at once a window on the way that many, if not most, white Americans view the world and their place in it, and a pollutant that leaches barbarism into the modern era. The fable attempts to glorify the indefensible, to enshrine an era and mission that represent the nation’s lowest moral denominators . Thanksgiving as framed in the mythology is, consequently, a drag on that which is potentially civilizing in the national character, a crippling, atavistic deformity. Defenders of the holiday will claim that the politically-corrected children’s version promotes brotherhood, but that is an impossibility – a bald excuse to prolong the worship of colonial “forefathers” and to erase the crimes they committed. Those bastards burned the Pequot women and children, and ushered in the multinational business of slavery. These are facts. The myth is an insidious diversion – and worse. 
Humanity cannot tolerate a 21st Century superpower, much of whose population perceives the world through the eyes of 17th Century land and flesh bandits. Yet that is the trick that fate has played on the globe. We described the roots of the planetary dilemma in our March 13 commentary, “ Racism & War, Perfect Together. ” 
The English arrived with criminal intent - and brought wives and children to form new societies predicated on successful plunder. To justify the murderous enterprise, Indians who had initially cooperated with the squatters were transmogrified into ""savages"" deserving displacement and death. The relentlessly refreshed lie of Indian savagery became a truth in the minds of white Americans, a fact to be acted upon by every succeeding generation of whites. The settlers became a singular people confronting the great ""frontier"" - a euphemism for centuries of genocidal campaigns against a darker, ""savage"" people marked for extinction. 
The necessity of genocide was the operative, working assumption of the expanding American nation. ""Manifest Destiny"" was born at Plymouth Rock and Jamestown, later to fall (to paraphrase Malcolm) like a rock on Mexico, the Philippines, Haiti, Nicaragua, etc. Little children were taught that the American project was inherently good, Godly, and that those who got in the way were ""evil-doers"" or just plain subhuman, to be gloriously eliminated. The lie is central to white American identity, embraced by waves of European settlers who never saw a red person. 
Only a century ago, American soldiers caused the deaths of possibly a million Filipinos whom they had been sent to “liberate” from Spanish rule. They didn’t even know who they were killing, and so rationalized their behavior by substituting the usual American victims. Colonel Funston , of the Twentieth Kansas Volunteers, explained what got him motivated in the Philippines: 
""Our fighting blood was up and we all wanted to kill 'niggers.' This shooting human beings is a 'hot game,' and beats rabbit hunting all to pieces."" Another wrote that ""the boys go for the enemy as if they were chasing jack-rabbits .... I, for one, hope that Uncle Sam will apply the chastening rod, good, hard, and plenty, and lay it on until they come into the reservation and promise to be good 'Injuns.'"" 
Last week in northern Iraq another American colonel, Joe Anderson of the 101st Airborne (Assault) Division, revealed that he is incapable of perceiving Arabs as human beings. Colonel Anderson, who doubles as a commander and host of a radio call-in program and a TV show designed to win the hearts and minds of the people of Mosul, had learned that someone was out to assassinate him. In the wild mood swing common to racists, Anderson decided that Iraqis are all alike – and of a different breed. He said as much to the Los Angeles Times . 
""They don't understand being nice,"" said Anderson, who helps oversee the military zone that includes Mosul and environs. He doesn't hide his irritation after months dedicated to restoring the city: ""We spent so long here working with kid gloves, but the average Iraqi guy will tell you, 'The only thing people respect here is violence…. They only understand being shot at, being killed. That's the culture.' … Nice guys do finish last here."" 
Col. Anderson personifies the unfitness of Americans to play a major role in the world, much less rule it. ""We poured a lot of our heart and soul into trying to help the people,” he bitched, as if Americans were God’s gift to the planet. ""But it can be frustrating when you hear stupid people still saying, 'You're occupiers. You want our oil. You're turning our country over to Israel.'” He cannot fathom that other people – non-whites – aspire to run their own affairs, and will kill and die to achieve that basic right. 
What does this have to do with the Mayflower? Everything. Although possibly against their wishes, the Pilgrims hosted the Wampanoag for three no doubt anxious days. The same men killed and enslaved Wampanoags immediately before and after the feast. They, their newly arrived English comrades and their children roasted hundreds of neighboring Indians alive just 16 years later, and two generations afterwards cleared nearly the whole of New England of its indigenous “savages,” while enthusiastically enriching themselves through the invention of transoceanic, sophisticated means of enslaving millions. The Mayflower’s cultural heirs are programmed to find glory in their own depravity, and savagery in their most helpless victims, who can only redeem themselves by accepting the inherent goodness of white Americans. 
Thanksgiving encourages these cognitive cripples in their madness, just as it is designed to do.",1
20755,20755,Hillary Clinton Speaks to the Dead For ‘Therapeutic Release’,Cassandra Fairbanks,"We Are Change 
As disturbing revelations about Hillary Clinton’s inner circle come to light thanks to the Wikileaks revelations, it seems like an appropriate time to remind everyone that the former First Lady speaks to the dead for “therapeutic release.”

Clinton’s bizarre pastime was detailed in the 1996 book “The Choice” by Bob Woodward.
Some of the candidate’s favorite dead friends include Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi. When it was suggested by one of her advisers, Jean Houston, the co-director of the Foundation for Mind Research, that she try speaking to Jesus Christ instead. Clinton refused and stated that speaking to Jesus would be “too personal.”
“Most people in the White House did not know about Hillary’s sessions with Houston. … To some of the few who did, the meetings could trigger politically damaging comparisons to Nancy Reagan’s use of astrology,” Woodward wrote.
Clinton has not been very secretive about her penchant for speaking to the dead, either.
In the 90s, she wrote about a discussion she had with Eleanor Roosevelt, and what she claims the spirit told her.
“She usually responds by telling me to buck up, or at least to grow skin as thick as a rhinoceros,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in a column about her seeking advice from the dead former First Lady.
Bill Clinton even spoke about his wife’s conversations with the dead during a speech in 2012.
On Friday, it was revealed that her campaign chairman John Podesta was invited by his brother to attend a “ Spirit Cooking ” dinner.
The Podestas' ""Spirit Cooking"" dinner?

In a shocking video, the woman who invited them, performance artist and occultist Marina Abramovic is seen painting the recipe for these “spirit dinners,” using what appears to be thickly coagulated blood. The recipe read, at one point, “mix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm, drink on earthquake nights.”

I guess we have all noticed that the holier-than-thou groups who whined that Trump wasn’t going to accept the outcome of the election refuse to accept it themselves.
Because I was critical of the George W. Bush regime, the liberal-progressive-leftwing and homosexual/transgendered rights groups have me on their mailing lists. 
And it is unbelievable. The entirety of “the other America” refuses to accept the people’s decision. They think that their concerns are more important than the concerns of the American people, who they regard as nothing but a collection of racist homophobic rednecks. 
Unless they provoke him beyond reason, Trump is not going to bother any of these people.
Trump wants to bring middle class jobs back to Americans, including for all those paid to protest him.
In order to avoide nuclear war, Trump wants to restore normal relations between the major nuclear powers. 
When there are no jobs for Americans that pay enough to support an independent existence, Trump doesn’t see the point of massive legal and illegal immigration.
This is only common sense.
Yet “the threatened people” see it as fascism.
Who are “the threatened people?” As always, the most powerful.
Tell me, what lobby is more powerful than the Israel Lobby? You can’t. But the Jewish Lobby, J Street, has sent me a hysterical email at 5:11pm on 14 November. Unless “we all come together and oppose Trump’s appointment of Breitbart editor Stephan Bannon as chief strategist and senior counselor” a “wave of hate will sweep across the land,” consuming “Jews, Muslims, African-Americans, LGBT peoople (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered), immigrants, Hispanics, women and other groups.”
Really now! So is Trump’s chief strategist, whatever position that is, going to attack the Jews and those with unusual sexual impulses with drones and cluster bombs, like the zionist neoconservatives who controlled the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama regimes did to millions of slaughtered and displaced peoples in 7 countries, and like Israel does to Palestinians? Or is the former Breitbart editor going to round them all up and torture them in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo like Bush and Obama did. And like Netanyahu does in Israel?
Or will Trump simply shoot them down in the streets like Netanyahu does to the Palestinian women and children. 
How come J Street and the Oligarchy-funded fronts are only concerned with nonexistent threats and ignore all of the real threats?
According to J Street, the main concern is that Trump has appointed an “Alt-Right” person to advise him. Dangerous tensions between nuclear powers? A collapsing American middle class?
These concerns, if present, are in the peripheral vision of the “threatened people.” 
According to the front group known as the Southern Poverty Law Center, Trump’s election by fly-over America has resulted in “over 250 reports of hate crimes around the country.” Is the Southern Poverty Law Center including the brutal beating of a white man by a gang of blacks? How many innocents has Trump slaughtered and put into concentration camps? How many countries has he invaded? The corrupt American media and oligarchic front groups have created “the new Hitler” before he is even inaugerated.
The Klingon Clintons and neoconed Bush/Cheney and Obama killing regimes have murdered more people and invaded more countries than Hitler, and the holier-than-thou group doesn’t care. Yet, the all-powerful Israeli Lobby thinks a Breibart editor is going to target the Jews, immigrants, the transgendered and homosexuals, women, Muslims, Hispanics, “and other groups.” What a change this will be. Only non-immigrant, white, heterosexual males will be in the protected group known as the “preferred minority.”
We must hope that Donald Trump understands the state of moral, cultural, legal, and political collapse that America is in. Two years ago at the Valdai International Discussion Club, Russian President Vladimir Putin said:
“Many of the Euro-Atlantic countries are actually rejecting their roots, including the Christian values that constitute the basis of Western civilization. They are denying moral principles and all traditional identities, national, cultural, religious, and even secular. They are implementing policies that equate families with same-sex partnerships, worship of God with worship of Satan. I am convinced that this opens a direct path to degradation and primitivism, resulting in a profound demographic and moral crisis.”
Ordinary Americans know what he means. They are forced to accept blasphemous films about Jesus Christ and shameless newspaper caricatures of the Virgin Mary, but if one of them calls a homosexual a pervert, he has committed a hate crime.
America is a country without an honest media. A country wihout an honest judiciary. Without an honest government. Without an honest legislature. Without honest schools and universities. A country whose morals are confused by propaganda. A country whose elites believe that they are entitled to all the income and wealth and that normal American people are the “deplorables,” to use Hillary’s term for ordinary Americans.

20759,20759,Coulter Calls Out ’Beta Males’ for Threatening ’Rodney King Riots’ Over Berkeley Speech - Breitbart,Jeff Poor,"Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” conservative commentator Ann Coulter, author of “In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!” took aim at what she described as “beta males” behind what could be “Rodney King riots” staged to protest a speech she has pledged to give next week at the University of California in Berkeley, CA.  After having her speech canceled by   officials due to safety concerns and then only to have those same officials propose an alternate date for her speech, Coulter dismissed the claim security as a reason for any cancellation. She labeled the protesters as “beta males” with weapons behind what could be “Rodney King riots” allowed by the local police department. “[N]one of this has to do with security,” she said. “After acceding to all their requirements, which were also arbitrary and silly, and they claimed it was on the basis of safety, I suggested two measures that actually would allow free speech to exist on Berkeley if they wanted it to. And that was one thing to announce that any students caught engaging in violence, mayhem, or disrupting an invited speaker’s speech would be expelled. And number two, to have a little talk with the Berkeley chief of police, who is allowing these Rodney King riots to go on whenever conservative speaker speaks. ” “I mean, it is anarchy when you are only enforcing the law in order to allow liberals to speak,” she continued. “But, no, we’ll let these masked rioters show up with weapons and start  —   I mean, they are all little beta males, but with a weapon, even a beta male can do some damage, especially to a   girl. To have them stepping in, those private individuals, according to courts, are acting under color of state law. And for the police to refuse to protect even offensive speech and by the way, and I’m the author of 12 New York Times  . This has damaged my reputation for them to be acting like I’m David Duke out there. But courts have found, even somebody out burning an American flag, the police cannot stand by and let skinheads beat them up. That is viewpoint discrimination.

20760,20760,‘The Bodies Are Decomposing’ After Mudslide in Colombia - The New York Times,Nicholas Casey,"José Estrella pulled a handkerchief to cover his face as he began to speak. The air around the morgue in Mocoa was filled with the smell of the dead, he said, who included his sister and two nephews. “Now the bodies are decomposing because they are in open air,” said Mr. Estrella, his voice cracking as he spoke by telephone. He was unable to retrieve the bodies, he said the morgue, overloaded with the dead, was understaffed. The bodies were piling up on Monday morning in Mocoa, a Colombian city where mud and debris had made it impossible in places to see that anyone had ever lived there. Rescue workers continued to scour the rubble for the dead. And family members, like Mr. Estrella, pleaded for the bodies of loved ones so they could offer them a proper burial. The provincial capital in the southern mountains of the country was devastated by a flood of water and debris on Saturday that has so far claimed at least 262 lives. The heavy rains caused nearby rivers to rise, generating a torrent that leveled homes and neighborhoods. “The putrefaction is beginning,” said Nixon Piaguaje, a local radio journalist. Rescue teams, some covered in mud, waded through a landscape of stone and earth in what in many cases had become a search for bodies rather than survivors. Hundreds of relief workers arrived in the town to distribute supplies. President Juan Manuel Santos acknowledged “bottlenecks” in the relief process, but said more help would be arriving soon and promised a full reconstruction of the city. Edgar Ruiz, an indigenous leader, expressed frustration in a phone interview after trudging through the mud searching for lost members from his community, the Siona people. So far, he said, he had located six families alive from his group, but eight more were unaccounted for. “We went to the health centers and the morgue as well, but they were nowhere,” he said. Mr. Santos said that at least 43 of the dead were children. “We send our prayers to all of them,” he said. “To their families we send condolences and the sympathy of the entire country. ” Colombian television transmitted images of loved ones still searching for lost children in the rubble. “I did everything that was possible: I told my son don’t let go, and he said he wouldn’t,” Yuri Narváez told Colombian television station Caracol TV. “But the current came and we lost him. ” Mr. Piaguaje, the radio journalist, said there were so many bodies that there was no one to bury them all. “When someone finds a cadaver, they take them to the cemetery and just leave them there,” he said. He said scores of bodies were still lying in open air. On Monday afternoon, Mr. Estrella, the man who was unable to get the bodies of his relatives in the morgue, recalled rushing to the neighborhood of San Miguel after hearing the mudslide to see if his family members were still alive. Instead he looked on as rescue workers pulled out their bodies: First his sister, who lay near the ruins of her home, then her two daughters, one 8, the other just 5 months. He said he had since been haunted by the smell of the dead. “You smell it for hundreds of feet,” he said. “There are people who faint when they open the bags and the bodies are putrefied. ”",0

Corruption. Bribery. Death. All three are examined in various news reports on a little known “specialty pharmaceutical company” called Insys Theraputics. They are currently under legal fire for Subsys, a controversial sublingual spray that disperses fentanyl, a very fast acting opioid that is “80 times more potent than morphine.” The under the tongue delivery allows the fentanyl to bypass the gastrointestinal system and deliver the opioid directly into the blood stream. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled that Subsys can only be prescribed to help cancer patients gain relief from “sudden spikes of excruciating pain.” 
Sarah Fuller was a 32 year old woman who suffered from anxiety and fibromyalgia . She didn’t have cancer. But that didn’t stop her doctor from prescribing Subsys for her aches and pains. The fentanyl acted quickly with Sarah’s already prescribed Xanax, a benzodiazepine. She died. Her family is suing the manufacturer. But why did Sarah’s doctor prescribe a drug that wasn’t approved? That’s easy to answer. Just follow the money. 
As Stat reports, the sales of Subsys grew to $331 million precisely because physicians give it to patients that don’t have cancer, like Sarah Fuller. Doctors get big dollars to simply talk about the drug over dinner, or lunch. Over $6 million dollars have been paid to doctors and health practitioners for this word of mouth activity. 
Take the example of nurse practitioner Heather Alfonso from Illinois. She was paid $83,000 to “go to dinner with a few people,” and in response, prescribed $1.6 million dollars of Subsys scripts to patients that weren’t suffering with cancer pain. She didn’t contest the allegations against her. 
Getting paid to speak isn’t automatically a bribe, but it appears to be a consistent theme when it comes to Susbys marketing methods. Alabama prosecutors built a case against Nancy Reed Perhacs, who used to be a sales representative for Insys Theraputics. Ms. Perhacs coordinated speaking fees for a doctor friend, provided he prescribed Subsys. Her take was $700,000. Other investigations about similar practices are ongoing in Kansas, Rhode Island, New York, Oregon, Michigan, Florida and New Hampshire. 
The chief executive, founder and chairman of Insys Theraputics is billionaire John Kapoor. He’s been around the block with other controversial pharmaceutical start ups. Kapoor thinks doctors are “all ethical.” His new FDA approved drug is a chemically created synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) called Syndros. As states legalize the real medicine in cannabis , THC and CBD oil , this is an important pharmaceutical to boycott.

20763,20763,The Forgotten Man,Judge Andrew Napolitano,"The forgotten man decided the presidential election. Donald Trump persuaded the forgotten man to repose his anger and frustration and power into Trump’s hands. Who is the forgotten man? What does he want from government? Why did he vote for Trump?
When the tide began to turn against Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night, I planned to write this column about the unwarranted and unlawful injection of the FBI into the political process. At the time, I was seated with the Fox News number crunchers and generally was exposed to trends and vote totals — and the number crunchers’ lucid explanation of them — long before they were revealed on-air. I am more an ideas guy than a numbers guy.
On Tuesday night, the numbers were so overwhelming it was clear that the FBI had nothing to do with the outcome of the presidential election. The numbers on Tuesday told a tale that needs to be related. What the FBI did and failed to do assaulted the rule of law, but that is for another column.
Whatever the impression Trump may have given you — a carnival barker, a hero, a jerk, a courageous leader — he brilliantly tapped into a deep vein of millions of American men and women who believe they have been forgotten by the government they pay for. These good people have been alienated by the elites who dominate American government and culture and civic life.
On Tuesday night, they found a home.
The forgotten man believes that the Obama administration doesn’t care about him. The forgotten man knows that the government put into place regulations of economic activity that put him out of work or into a lower-paying job. These forgotten men and women resent the Obama administration’s telling them they must have health insurance or they will be taxed for it and then so incompetently manipulating the marketplace as to cause the cost of that insurance — often an unwanted product — to skyrocket.
These good folks cringed when their family doctor told them that he could no longer afford to treat them because the feds had over regulated the practice of medicine. They simply couldn’t believe that their own government would make the practice of medicine so expensive that doctors in droves could not afford to stay in business. And they were outraged when their doctors told them the feds could see their medical records and dictate their medical treatment.
The forgotten man has profound resentment for a government that is telling him how to live. The forgotten man’s union dues have shot up. His union leaders use his dues to support political candidates he doesn’t know or like. Yet he has usually voted for the Democrats — out of a traditional belief that the Democrats would think of him and his needs when framing federal legislation. They haven’t.
The forgotten man speaks his mind but isn’t drawn to lofty arguments about the freedom of speech. The forgotten man wants the government to work but couldn’t tell you which aspects of its behavior are unconstitutional. The forgotten man wants elected officials who don’t and won’t forget him. The forgotten man hopes he never sees a judge in a courtroom, but if he does, he wants to be judged by someone who understands him.
The forgotten man wants sexual freedom and privacy, but not babies being ripped from the womb for convenience. The forgotten man doesn’t want war but loathes military defeat even more. The forgotten man wants inexpensive goods but will pay more if they are made here by people like him. The forgotten man doesn’t want the government to take so much money from those who work hard that they lose their incentive to work or close up their businesses and kill jobs. The forgotten man wants everyone to be able to keep the lion’s share of what he earns. The forgotten man forgives but doesn’t forget.
Trump got all that. Trump tapped into all that as no presidential candidate had since Ronald Reagan in 1980.
The forgotten man viewed Clinton as having no interest in him. The forgotten man believed that Clinton would work for special interests and not for him. The forgotten man saw that what Trump grasped, Clinton overlooked; what Trump understood, Clinton ignored; and what Trump turned into votes, Clinton took for granted.
I doubt that the forgotten man saw what I did recently. At the Al Smith dinner in New York City last month — a 1,500-person black-tie fundraiser for the Archdiocese of New York at which Trump’s speech was mediocre and Clinton’s was stellar — I tried to shake the hands of both of them but ran into a Secret Service roadblock around the head table. Trump waved to me with a twinkle in his eye. When I saw Clinton, I saw a lonely face without joy. On Wednesday morning, it dawned on me that she was doomed and she knew it.
The forgotten man knew it, as well.

20765,20765,NFL Preview: Championship Match-Ups Prove Teams Without Elite QB’s Wasting Time - Breitbart,Daniel Leberfeld,"The NFL is a   league, so it should come as no surprise that the last four teams standing have elite  . [Sunday’s conference championship games feature perhaps the NFL’s four best quarterbacks this season, Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers, Atlanta’s Matt Ryan, Pittsburgh’s Ben Roethlisberger and New England’s Tom Brady.  A lot of head coaches and offensive coordinators were fired over the last few weeks. In most cases, they met their end due to the lack of an elite quarterback. In the NFL, it’s hard to be a great coach or offensive coordinator without a   quarterback. So the four coaches left standing  —   Green Bay’s Mike McCarthy, Atlanta’s Dan Quinn, Pittsburgh’s Mike Tomlin and New England’s Bill Belichick are four very fortunate men. They have special quarterbacks. So many other NFL head coaches are spinning their wheels because they lack an elite player under center. Sunday’s two games should be special with this quartet of magnificent quarterbacks on the two fields of action. Here is a breakdown of the NFL’s two conference championship games: Green Bay Packers at Atlanta Falcons NFC Championship GameSunday, January 22, 3:05 PM on FOX Georgia Dome, Atlanta, Georgia, This game should be a classic NFL shootout, a   of two   quarterbacks, facing a pair of suspect defenses. No NFL team scored more points this past season than the   Falcons. He threw 38 touchdowns in the regular season, and tossed three more in a playoff win over Seattle. He’s playing the best football of his career. The game’s other quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, is also playing on a very high level. Ever since his proclamation that the Packers would “run the table” after starting the season   which they did, he’s been tearing up opposing defensive backfields. During the regular season, he threw a remarkable 40 touchdowns, and has added six more in two playoff wins. His interception last week in Dallas was his first in nine games. And Rodgers has destroyed some very good defenses over the last month, putting up 38 points against both the New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings, and 34 last week in Dallas. You could make a strong argument the Falcons’ defense isn’t as good as these three units. So the Packers’ offense could march through Atlanta like Sherman. But keep in mind, Falcons coach Dan Quinn has a   record against Rodgers, as a defensive coordinator in Seattle and head coach (and de facto defensive coordinator) in Atlanta. So Quinn has a good feel for how to deal with Rodgers. Also, Rodgers currently has the flu, so he might be less than 100 percent during this game. Speaking of health issues, Falcons star receiver Julio Jones isn’t 100 percent, dealing with a painful toe injury that kept him out of practice on Wednesday and Thursday. This injury tends to get worse as the game progresses. The Packers also have some question marks at receiver with Jordy Nelson (ribs) Davante Adams (ankle) and Geronimo Allison (hamstring) all   decisions. Expect two of the three to play. On Saturday, the Packers called up WR Max McCaffrey from the practice squad as insurance. This game is too close to call, and could come down to which team has the ball last. Pittsburgh Steelers at New England Patriots NFC ChampionshipSunday, 6:40 PM on CBS Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts, This is the 11th AFC Championship game appearance for Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. If the Steelers hope to keep him from his seventh Super Bowl appearance, they need to duplicate what the Denver Broncos did in last year’s AFC Championship game, put the Pats’ superstar QB on the ground a lot. In Denver’s   win over New England on January 24, 2016, the Broncos sacked Brady four times, and had 17 QB hits. While it might be hard for the Steelers to duplicate what Denver did since they don’t have linebacker Von Miller, their pass rush really improved late in the season. Pittsburgh has won nine straight, and during that streak, they’ve have the most sacks in in the NFL. A big reason for Pittsburgh’s resurgent pass rush was the return of outside linebacker Bud Dupree, who didn’t play when New England beat Pittsburgh in Week Seven due to a hernia. The explosive Dupree, and veteran James Harrison on the other side, have been on a tear. They need that to continue this week if the Steelers hope to have any chance at winning this game. Brady was average by his standards in New England’s playoff win over Houston last week, but the Patriots still won by 18. This illustrates Brady’s greatness. A pedestrian performance by #12 is still better than most. “Pedestrian” would be a good word to describe Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger the last six games. In Pittsburgh’s playoff win over Kansas City last week, they had to settle for six field goals. Maybe his left knee is still a problem. On October 17, he had arthroscopic surgery. And not helping matters for Roethlisberger is Sunday’s game is on the road. In eight road games this season, “Big Ben” completed just 59. 4 percent of his passes, throwing just nine touchdowns to eight interceptions. In eight games at home, he completed 70. 8 percent of his throws, and threw 20 touchdowns to five interceptions with a 116. 7 rating. A big reason the Steelers have been able to win, despite less than stellar play from the franchise QB, has been the amazing play of tailback Le’Veon Bell, who has emerged as the NFL’s best runner. Not only is Bell a great player, but he’s playing behind the NFL’s best offensive line, which has further enhanced his game. Stopping Bell will be a herculean task for New England. But the Steelers will need more from Roethlisberger than they got last week at Arrowhead Stadium. You can beat Chiefs QB Alex Smith with six field goals, but not Brady. “We know that [Brady and Roethlisberger) are Hall of Famers one day,” said Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey said. “When that type of competition goes head to head against each other, it should be a show out there. ” It certainly should be, but it’s hard to pick against Brady at home in the playoffs. In the   he’s   in Foxboro. So there is a very good chance the Patriots win a   game at Gillette Stadium.",0

As sons and daughters, we recognize the love they have given and the sacrifices they have made, and we celebrate the indispensable role fathers play in our lives and communities. “Fathers have the ability and responsibility to instill in us core values we carry into adulthood.  The examples they set and the lessons they impart about hard work, dedication to family, faith in God, and believing in ourselves establish the moral foundation for success that allows us to live up to our full potential.  We remember those fatherly moments big and small    throwing a baseball, writing an essay, driving a car, walking down the aisle    that have shaped us, and we thank our dads for being there with a helping hand and an open heart.

20768,20768,Osama bin Laden’s older brother rents out luxury student flats in Scotland,nan,"Osama bin Laden’s older brother rents out luxury student flats in Scotland   
The older brother of 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden is one of Scotland’s richest student landlords, it has emerged. 
Bakr Mohammed bin Laden, brother of the deceased Al-Qaeda chief, was identified as the owner of Glasgow’s Woodside House – a luxury student apartment complex. 
The building, which was opened earlier this year, sits on a site worth £1.5 million ($1.8 million) in the affluent Glasgow neighborhood of West End. 
Wealthy students are charged £13,000 per year to reside in the extravagant studio flats, while enjoying access to dinner party rooms, a private gym, and a cinema. The Saudi tycoon is one of the partners of Kelso Estates Ltd, which officially owns the property. 
“In addition to two other current officers, engineer Bakr Mohammed bin Laden is indeed named as a person with significant control of Kelso Estates Ltd,” said the building’s management company Collegiate AC Chief Executive Heriberto Cuanalo. 
Engineering student Chenhan Ye, from China, said he was “certainly surprised” to learn bin Laden owns the building he lives in. 
“I think people will see this as a risk,” 
Student housing campaign Rent Strike, which has been fighting against spiraling student rents, told RT the “story only furthers our longstanding belief that all landlords are b*stards.” 
“We look forward to damaging his profit margins in due course,” a spokesperson said. 
Bakr bin Laden is the owner of the billion dollar construction company Saudi Binladin Group, which is responsible for building Riyadh’s King Abdullah Financial District with a £816 million check. 
Sources describe bin Laden as “the true ruler of Jeddah,” but the billionaire keeps a very low profile. Share This Article...",1

EMAILS,Iron Sheik,"Home › POLITICS | US NEWS › HUMA ABEDIN SWORE UNDER OATH SHE GAVE UP ‘ALL THE DEVICES’ WITH STATE DEPT. EMAILS HUMA ABEDIN SWORE UNDER OATH SHE GAVE UP ‘ALL THE DEVICES’ WITH STATE DEPT. EMAILS 0 SHARES [10/30/16] In a normal election year, a normal candidate’s close aide who caused even minor embarrassment to a campaign so near to Election Day would be whisked away as quickly as possible to avoid becoming a distraction. 
But Huma Abedin is not simply a close aide, she’s a critical member of Hillary Clinton’s tiny inner circle that protects and — at times — enables the deeply flawed and secretive Democratic nominee. 
So despite FBI Director James Comey’s announcement that the bureau is reviewing emails from Abedin’s time at the State Department reportedly found on a laptop she shared with her soon-to-be ex-husband Anthony Weiner (confiscated as a part of the FBI’s investigation into allegations he sexted with a 15-year-old North Carolina girl), the campaign made clear on Saturday that she’s not going anywhere. 
John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign, told reporters on a conference call that Abedin had been nothing but cooperative with investigators and sat for hours of depositions last summer as part of the civil lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch. 
“There’s nothing that she’s done that we think calls into question anything that she’s done with respect to this investigation… we fully stand behind her,” Podesta said. 
But the new information that the FBI found State Department-related email on her home laptop also calls into question whether Abedin in fact turned over all of the devices she used to send and receive email while working at State. 
On June 28, 2016, Abedin said under oath in a sworn deposition that she looked for all devices that she thought contained government work on them so the records could be given to the State Department. (These records were subsequently reviewed by the FBI.) 
“How did you go about searching for what records you may have in your possession to be returned to the State Department?” Attorney Ramona Cotca for Judicial Watch asked her. 
“I looked for all the devices that may have any of my State Department work on it and returned — returned — gave them to my attorneys for them to review for all relevant documents. And gave them devices and paper,” Abedin answered. Post navigation",1

20773,20773,Australia to hunt down anti-vax nurses and prosecute them for disobeying the medical police state,Vicki Batts,"Australia to hunt down anti-vax nurses and prosecute them for disobeying the medical police state 
  Vicki Batts Tags: vaccination , Australia , medical police state (NaturalNews) Is there some sort of race to see which country can eliminate the rights of its people first? It is certainly beginning to feel like there must be something going on, since government overreach looks like it is reaching an all-time high across the world.While countries like Australia demonize other nations for their lack of progressiveness, recent developments suggest that its government is taking away people's freedom to think for themselves, slowly but surely chipping away at those who have dissenting opinions. The evidence? The newly released vaccination standards provided by The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia in response to what the organization described as, ""a small number of nurses and midwives promoting anti-vaccination via social media.""In their statement, they wrote that the board was merely taking the time to make its expectations in regards to vaccination and vaccination advice very clear to registered nurses, enrolled nurses and midwives. ""The board expects all registered nurses, enrolled nurses and midwives to use the best available evidence in making practice decisions.""This sentiment might have been acceptable, if it wasn't coupled with the organization also prompting people to tattle on each other. You see, the board is also urging members of the public to come forward and report nurses and midwives who may be expounding anti-vaccination beliefs. Surely anyone who goes against the grain deserves to be punished?If the medical industry was as strictly regulated as it purports itself to be, perhaps so many people wouldn't be dying each year from medical errors. An estimated 18,000 to 54,000 people in Australia lose their lives to medical mistakes each year – but the industry continues to insist that its those pesky thoughts that are really putting people in jeopardy. How dare anyone want to help people and think for themselves at the same time?In their statement, the board noted that any reports will not be taken lightly. ""The board will consider whether the nurse or midwife has breached their professional obligations and will treat these matters seriously.""To make matters worse, not only will these brave nurses and midwives be reported by people who may once have been their friends or colleagues, but the promotion of what the government deems ""misleading or deceptive information"" is a serious offense.And boy, will they take it seriously. Under national law, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency is able to prosecute anyone who commits such an act. While we all know that the true deception lies in the promotion of vaccines as a public health necessity, we also know that mainstream medicine will do anything to protect their precious immunizations.Dr. Hannah Dahlen, a professor of midwifery at the University of Western Sydney and the spokeswoman for the Australian College of Midwives, told The Guardian that nurses and midwives are respected individuals who play an important role in society, and that she believes that people take their advice quite seriously. She went on to say, ""I agree that they have a very serious obligation to provide the best available evidence, and it is of course concerning that some are taking to social media in order to express a position not backed by science.""But are concerns about what's in vaccines really not backed by science? Many people might say that continuing to ignore the evidence that there are horrible toxins like glyphosate and mercury in vaccines is what goes against science .In a rather ironic statement, Dahlen declared, ""The worry is the confirmation bias that can occur, because people might say: 'There you go, this is proof that you can't even have an alternative opinion.' It might in fact just give people more fuel for their belief systems.""Legislating dissenting opinions into extinction, and persecuting those who are raising awareness about a very real problem is proof that alternative opinions are not allowed. That's really all there is to it; it's biased, unjust and frankly, more befitting of the very governments Australia speaks out against. Sources:",1
20774,20774,Government Report: Islamists Building ’Parallel Society’ in Sweden Aided By PC Culture,Liam Deacon,"Aided by a politically correct culture of “tolerance” the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) is secretly building a “parallel” society in Sweden by infiltrating organisations and political parties, a government report has concluded. [Surprisingly, the document takes aim at “political elites” for fostering a doctrine of multiculturalism and silence, which can help and facilitate the nefarious ends of   organisation like the Brotherhood.  Somewhat predictably, however, the publication of such claims in Sweden  —   where open criticism of liberal, multicultural ideals is rare  —   has caused a row, with critics labelling the report “conspiratorial” and claiming it misrepresents Islam. Published Friday, the document was commissioned by Sweden’s Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) part of the country’s Ministry of Defence, which is responsible for civil protection and public safety. The paper’s authors claim the Brotherhood is working to increase the number of practicing Muslims in Sweden, encouraging tension with Secular society, and targeting political parties, NGOs, academic institutions and other civil society organisations. They also slam the “established structure of values among the country’s political elite [which] places a high value on ‘acceptance’ and ‘tolerance’ of citizens who are in some sense different from the mainstream”. In the report, the Islamism of the MB is described as a totalitarian political ideology born out of Islam, a religion. This can make it “difficult to oppose what on the surface appears to be (a vulnerable minority) religious rights” it explains. Critics, therefore, “run the risk of being called ‘racist’ or ‘Islamophobic’ and because of the situation in Swedish society such classifications endanger people’s careers”. The press was quick to label these claims inflammatory, and 22 academics and “experts” in religion have published a blog post questioning the methodology of the research. The academics  —   from many of Sweden’s leading universities  —   say it is “almost conspiratorial” to suggest criticism of Islamism is difficult in Sweden. They also insist the claim that the Brotherhood is building a parallel society is refuted in past research. In response to the blog post, the department has refuted the criticism of their methodology, and the report’s editor, Magnus Norell, told public service broadcaster SVT: “Had they smoked something before they read it? You just need to read the report. If someone doesn’t accept this, there’s not much I can do about it. It’s proven. ” Controversially in Sweden, the report also links Islamism and poor social integration to immigration. “Islamists aim to build a parallel social structure competing with the rest of the Swedish society the values of its citizens. In this sense, MB’s activists pose a   challenge in terms of the country’s social cohesion” it states. Adding: “Migration from Africa and the Middle East is likely to continue in coming years, both in form of relatives and refugees  …     “Given that MB’s goal is to increase the number of practising Muslims in Swedish or European territory, there is a great likelihood that a ‘tug of war’ will occur between the majority community and the Islamic community with the MB’s encouragement  …    ” The authors of the blog post objected to this claim. “The [report’s] authors seem to conclude that Swedish Islam is a homogeneous phenomenon and that Swedish Muslims are led by the Muslim Brotherhood  …    ” they write. “It is a conclusion that goes against the overall research, which rather points towards the Muslim community being diverse and there being competition between Muslim groups  …    ” Founded in 1826, the MB aims to create a global, Sunni Islamic Caliphate by organising Muslims politically. It is arguably the largest Islamist organisation in the world and has links to the Muslim Council of Britain and many other mainstream European Islamic institution. The group has been accused of fostering links to militants and is considered a terrorist organisation by the governments of Bahrain, Egypt, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.",0

An Army veteran named Tyson (who prefers to keep his last name private), had severe post-traumatic stress disorder, and wasn’t paying much attention to his wife, Adrienne, or his children. He then welcomed a service dog named Argon into his home, and it had a profound impact. 
“When the days were so dark for Tyson, I wasn’t sure if I could get through to him,” his wife wrote in a recent letter addressed to Argon. “I am so glad you are here with us. You have brought life back into Tyson.”

20778,20778,This Is a Jobs Report That Democrats Can Boast About - The New York Times,Neil Irwin,"There’s not much to say about the July jobs numbers beyond this: They’re good news across the board. More Americans are working, and they’re getting paid more money for their efforts. People who weren’t even looking for jobs now are, and they’re finding them. A blockbuster job growth number for June wasn’t downgraded with further analysis, but rather revised higher. It’s an election year, which means these numbers will inevitably be viewed through the prism of how they affect the chances of Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump to seize the White House. And to the degree a good economy (and good economic headlines) benefits the incumbent party, there’s no question this helps Mrs. Clinton. Political science research particularly points to changes in income as being predictors of how people vote, and the July data on average hourly earnings suggest American workers are being paid more: a 2. 6 percent gain over the last year, tied for the highest since 2009 and a comfortable gain in workers’ purchasing power in an era of roughly 1 percent annual inflation. So far in the campaign, Mrs. Clinton has resisted crowing about the strengths of the    economy and instead has emphasized her plans to try to strengthen the areas where conditions remain weak. The unemployment rate among adults over age 25 without a high school diploma was 6. 3 percent in July, for example, far above the 2. 5 percent for those with at least a bachelor’s degree. And while the proportion of Americans who were in the labor force  —   either working or looking for work  —   ticked up in July, it has recovered only a tiny sliver of its decline since the 2008 recession (it was 66 percent in December 2007, bottomed out last year at 62. 4 percent, and has recovered slightly to 62. 8 percent). Part of this drop is because baby boomers are hitting retirement age, but some large portion is less well understood, driven by both men and women of prime working age who tell   they’re not even looking for jobs. If you try to search the latest Labor Department numbers for bad news, the closest you’ll find is a rise in the number of people who have been unemployed for 27 weeks  —   in other words, people who may say they want work but are becoming increasingly unattached from the habits of holding down a job. So that creates a fascinating backdrop for the economic discussion during the homestretch of the election. The economy truly is growing, and job growth looks to be robust. Expect President Obama and his administration to celebrate (and seek credit for) the good numbers. Expect Mrs. Clinton to seek to show empathy for those who are being left behind even by this stronger recovery and to avoid claims that the economy is as robust as the headline numbers might suggest. And don’t be surprised if Mr. Trump repeats his claims that the economy is actually very weak. (He would have been on sounder footing using the poor   G. D. P. report late last week to make that argument, but he was distracted by other battles.) Here’s an interpretation of the available data over the last several months that incorporates all these realities. You probably won’t hear it on the campaign trail, but if a candidate’s job was to provide nuance rather than get elected, this is what could be said: The United States economy is creating jobs at a rapid pace most people who say they want a job are able to find one, and employers are having a hard enough time finding workers that they’re having to pay higher wages. But large segments of the population, especially those without advanced education, left the labor force during the last several years, and relatively few of them are being pulled back in by this improving job market. Fixing that will be an important goal of the next president. Meanwhile, for reasons that aren’t fully understood, economic output is growing much slower than job creation, which will mean lower living standards in the future if that continues. That should be another big worry for whoever occupies the Oval Office in January. Not the stuff of boisterous campaign rallies, but that’s what the facts are telling us.",0
20779,20779,Christians in 2017 ’Most Persecuted Group in the World’,"Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.","In many parts of the world, Christians gathering to celebrate Christ’s resurrection do so with the knowledge that any day their faith could cost them their lives as it has for thousands of their brothers and sisters. [On Palm Sunday, twin bombings by jihadists at two Egyptian churches killed at least 45 worshippers and wounded more than 100 others in the latest of a long string of deadly attacks targeting Christians throughout the world.  The attacks were directed specifically to Christian in their houses of worship to avoid any ambiguity regarding the intent. As has been noted, this was “an attack on Christians simply because they are Christians. ” On Saturday, the Pakistan military said it has thwarted a “major terrorist attack” against Christians planned for Easter Sunday after a successful overnight raid just hours after Christians celebrated Good Friday services. On Easter Sunday 2016, an Islamist militant took the lives of more than 70 people and injured over 320 more after detonating his suicide vest in a park in Lahore that was full of Christian families celebrating the feast. Among the victims are more than 30 small children, who at the time of the blast were playing sports and outdoor games in the    Park. During the last calendar year, some 90, 000 Christians were killed for their faith across the globe, making Christians by far the most persecuted group in the world, according to a study from the   Center for Studies on New Religions (CESNUR). The director of CESNUR, Dr. Massimo Introvigne, told Breitbart News that whereas atheistic communist regimes were the greatest persecutors of Christians in the last century, “Islamic  ” has taken its place as the   agent of persecution. The Center’s findings corroborate those of other scholars and human rights groups. According to the 2016 “World Watch List,” for example, published by the Open Doors organization, nine out of the top ten countries where Christians suffer “extreme persecution” had populations that are at least 50 percent Muslim. Their 2016 report revealed that “Islamic extremism is by far the most significant persecution engine” of Christians in the world today and that “40 of the 50 countries on the World Watch List are affected by this kind of persecution. ” During the year, nearly   of the Christians killed for their faith were executed at the hands of Islamic extremists such as the Islamic State or Boko Haram. While tens of thousands of Christians are killed for their faith, Introvigne said, they are just the tip of the iceberg and much persecution takes place on a daily basis that never makes news. Along with the enormous number of deaths, a great many more Christians —  as many as 600 million —  were prevented from practicing their faith in 2016. On Easter 2015, Pope Francis reminded the world that there are more Christian martyrs in the present age than even in the first centuries, when the Roman Empire attempted to eliminate all followers of the nascent religion. Calling for “tangible help in the defense and protection of our brothers and sisters who are persecuted, exiled, killed, and beheaded just for being Christians,” Francis told a crowd of tens of thousands in St. Peter’s Square that today’s martyrs “are more numerous than in the first centuries. ” Follow Thomas D.

20780,20780,Florida Woman Charged in Death of Infant in ‘Co-Sleeping’ Case - The New York Times,Christine Hauser,"Early on Oct. 6, Erin   was awakened by the sound of her baby crying. She later told the authorities in Florida that she had picked him up from a bassinet, prepared some formula in a bottle and settled back into bed with him, propping him up with a pillow and nestling his head in the crook of her arm. Then she dozed off. Two and a half hours later, according to a Polk County sheriff’s affidavit, Ms.   25, woke up “in a panic. ” Blood was on her baby boy, Javier, who was less than a month old, and vomit was coming out of his mouth, she told officials. Ms.   of Winter Haven in Central Florida, said she tried to revive the boy, and called 911. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital. When investigators interviewed Ms.   about the baby’s death, according to the document, she said, “It happened again. ” Prosectors say it was the second time an infant died under Ms.  ’s care: Her    daughter, Angelina, died of suffocation in 2009. That was ruled an accident. A spokeswoman for the coroner’s office said Javier also died of accidental suffocation. In November, Ms.   was charged with felony aggravated manslaughter of a child. But the police did not arrest her until Tuesday, after prosecutors reviewed the affidavit and reports. She was scheduled to appear on Wednesday before a judge, according to Polk County’s chief assistant state attorney, Brian Haas. It was not immediately clear whether she had a lawyer. The case touches on a pillar of parenting: how to get infants to sleep, especially for newborns who may require   feedings. It also shines a light on   in which parents share a room or a bed with their infants. The practice is considered controversial for medical and cultural reasons. Family   is common in many parts of the world, but it is generally discouraged in Western cultures, where children traditionally sleep in cribs in separate rooms. Some parents say that   helps to make babies more manageable at night, while others find the constant caregiving and interrupted sleep to be exhausting, a recent study found. Approximately 3, 500 infants die annually in the United States from   deaths, including sudden infant death syndrome, accidental suffocation and accidental strangulation in bed, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. To reduce the risk of those deaths, the academy  recommends positioning of babies supine in bed, using a firm sleep surface, sharing a room without sharing a bed, and avoiding soft bedding and overheating. The   case presents prosecutors with the challenge of showing that   was a form of neglect because the mother had been informed of the risks during both of her pregnancies. “These are very, very difficult cases,” Mr. Haas said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. “We are not charging parents with crimes because accidents happen. There has got to be something more to it. ” Mr. Haas said that the case was still in the discovery phase, and officials were gathering more information about what happened in October. The affidavit charging Ms.   said she had undergone counseling during both pregnancies. It said she had received information while she was pregnant with her first child about the “dangers” of   with babies, and of the importance of placing infants on their backs to sleep. But on Dec. 4, 2009, about two weeks after she had given birth to her baby girl, Ms.   fell asleep while   in bed, only to wake up and find the baby “cold and stiff to the touch” next to her, the sheriff’s affidavit said. The baby died of asphyxia from “probable overlay” and “” according to the medical examiner. When Ms.   learned she was pregnant in 2016, she received training through the Healthy Start program about   and putting an infant to sleep safely, documents show. Her mother and doctor also advised her, the affidavit said. In July, while pregnant, Ms.   was arrested on a charge of possessing methamphetamine, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. The felony charge in Javier’s death was based on his being “killed in the same manner as her first child, Angelina, due to her own culpable negligence and without lawful justification,” according to the affidavit. A spokeswoman for the coroner’s office, Sheli Wilson, said the death certificate called it an accidental suffocation, but she added that an autopsy had not been finalized. Relatives of Ms.   could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.",0

NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, Tennessee has inadvertently posted election night results exactly 1 week early. It appears The Fix Is In: 

From Mac Slavo, SHTFPlan : 
NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, Tennessee has inadvertently posted election night results. The results page appears to be similar to what mainstream news networks display on election night, including Presidential and Congressional results, the popular vote count, electoral votes, and percentage of precincts reporting. 
The page, a screen shot of which has been sourced from internet archive site The Wayback Machine , is posted below and shows totals for the upcoming Presidential race. It announces Hillary Clinton as the winner. 
As Jim Stone notes, the page was pulled directly from the WorldNow.com content management platform utilized by major networks like NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox and appears to be a non-public staging area for news and election results. 
The original page has since been reset. 
( Click here for full size image ) 
Though the results information appears on an FTP server at WorldNow.com, media companies like NBC’s WRCB TV utilize the platform, also know as “Frankly,” to power their news content. This can be verified directly a the WRCB web site by scrolling to the very bottom of the page footer which notes that it is, “Powered By Frankly.” 
In addition to national results, Jim Stone has identified another page at the WorldNow.com FTP server that appears to show the State-By-State Presidential election results. This page is also accessible in archive format at WayBack Machine with a line by line breakdown available at Stone’s website. 
Of interest is that the State-By-State results indicate a Hillary Clinton win in states like Texas (42% to 40%), Florida (44% to 40%) and Pennsylvania (44% to 40%) which have all been identified as states Clinton must steal to win the election . 
Do these latest election “results” confirm that the fix is in and the vote is rigged? 
If so, then we are no longer looking at an election where our votes will count, but rather, a selection where the winner is determined by those who count the votes.",1

World Heaves Sigh of Relief after Trump’s Victory By Finian Cunningham on November 9, 2016 A reflection of how disconnected the political class are from their own people. 
SPUTNIK 
The election of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the US certainly sent shockwaves around the world. But perhaps the uppermost sense is one of huge relief that Hillary Clinton was kept out of the White House. 
For most ordinary citizens around the world, Clinton, her multi-billion-dollar election campaign and the fawning corporate media coverage represented everything that is perceived as fundamentally wrong in Western politics. 
Her cronyism goes so far that she would not hesitate to start a world war with Russia, or whoever, in order to appease her corporate sponsors and indulge her deluded notion of “exceptional liberalism”. 
Trump’s stunning victory is a victory for common people and common sense. Despite the Western media’s systematic shielding of Clinton from criticism, a good number of ordinary Americans and other nationals around the world could clearly see her irredeemable flaws. 
She is a self-enriching puppet for Big Finance and the military-industrial complex. And, as her email scandal shows, a consummate liar on top. Donald Trump is a billionaire property tycoon with a big mouth and uncouth manner. He has never held an elected office before. It is unprecedented that he should become the president of the US. 
Will he really “make America great again”? Will he really deliver on massive infrastructure investments to regenerate impoverished working-class communities across America? We don’t know if he just an opportunist conman, or if he really does have a humble heart to reach out to all the “forgotten people” that he speaks about. One can hope. 
But one thing is for sure. Trump is no warmonger. And he doesn’t seem to be a puppet that can be pushed around. 
“We will deal fairly with everyone” 
In one of the live TV debates with Clinton during the campaign, Trump surprised many viewers when he said, apparently sincerely, that he would never commit a first-strike nuclear attack against any nation. It took a lot of guts and moral integrity to say that. Clinton didn’t answer the question, but her past record as Secretary of State shows that she has no hesitation about launching illegal wars and murdering foreign heads of state. 
Trump has also spoken several times about restoring friendly relations with America’s biggest nuclear rival Russia. He took a lot of heat for that from the Clinton campaign and the biased US media, who accused him of being a “stooge” for Russian President Vladimir Putin. To his credit, Trump did not cave in to the anachronistic “Russian baiting”, which has been a staple of American politics for decades. 
During his acceptance speech as President-elect, Trump repeated his oft-mentioned desire for the US to base its foreign relations on “partnership” instead of “hostility and conflict”. 
Notably, Russia’s Vladimir Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on winning the White House. Reciprocating goodwill, Putin said he hoped to work with Trump so that Russia and the US can “restore relations from their current critical condition”. 
Surely, this is the point. To replace outmoded ideological stereotypes and animosity with a pragmatic mutual respect to cooperate. 
Russia and its leader are not the enemy of the US, Europe nor the rest of the world – unless you are a terrorist network seeking illicit regime change. Architects of Endless “Regime Change” wars 
The people who have demonized Russia are ideologues in Washington and their surrogates among European governments and the Western corporate media. That negative image of Russia does not match reality as ordinary people perceive it, including many ordinary Americans. 
Russia did not destabilize Ukraine. It did not annex Crimea. Russia was not involved in shooting down a civilian airliner. It is not massacring civilians in Syria. In Syria, it is helping a sovereign state defeat terrorist mercenaries in a US-sponsored covert war for regime change. Russia is not a sports-drug pariah. It is not hacking computer systems nor subverting foreign democracies. These are all just false ideological constructs manufactured by the Western establishment and its subservient media. 
Ordinary citizens around the world, especially those in the US, know that. Their real-world concerns are dealing with poverty, unemployment and crumbling societies. This stuff about “Putin being the new Hitler” and “threatening the free world” is just so much baloney. 
Maybe because Trump is not a career politician or a Washington insider he knows all that too. And he knows that ordinary Americans are not being listened to by the establishment. That’s why Trump’s victory comes as such a shock. 
The political class have been so wrong on almost every issue, whether it was the Brexit and discontent with the European Union, or foreign relations with Russia, or Trump’s chances of winning the presidency. 
The Western political class have gotten it so wrong on so many issues because it is divorced from the reality as it affects most people. Aloof, elitist, out of touch and undemocratic. 
Yet this Western ruling class, as embodied by Hillary Clinton, would be prepared to start even more wars around the world than they already have, based on their own twisted self-serving logic. 
Consider these figures just released by the Pentagon. Under President Obama – who advocated for Clinton – US military exports to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast despots are double the amount under George W Bush. This weapons supply has gone towards arming jihadi terror groups. Clinton approved of this arms bazaar for terrorists when she was in office as part of Washington’s regime-change schemes. 
Yet these people like Obama and Clinton spout all sorts of “humanitarian” and “moralistic” mumbo-jumbo. They are liars. And they are the most cynical of corrupt politicians. The very breed of politician-puppets that ordinary decent people around the world have come to despise. Americans Not Fooled by ‘Presidential Campaign Tricks’ 
Trump, for all his personal flaws, is in a different category. He is astute enough to know that the pain of ordinary citizens stems from a badly broken economic system. 
The main good thing about Trump is that he is a pragmatist who at least appears to be on the side of ordinary people and on the side of restoring peaceful relations with other nations, Russia in particular. 
The prominent people dejected about Trump are the political class both in the US and Europe and their media echo chambers. 
It is notable that Germany’s Merkel and France’s Hollande both affected an air of disapproval over Trump’s victory – unlike Putin who magnanimously congratulated. Hollande said he would be “vigilant” in his future dealings with Trump. What is he talking about? 
That’s why Merkel and Hollande will be next to get kicked out of office in forthcoming elections. Like Obama, Clinton and the American establishment, the pro-US European ruling parties are so out of touch with reality. 
The demonization of Russia is a reflection of how disconnected the Western political class are from their own people. Ordinary people around the world want jobs, prosperity and peace. They know they can’t afford futile hostilities with Russia as have been foisted on them by their rulers, while such urgent social needs go neglected. 
Crazy as it may seem, Trump’s win may be a chance for the US to redeem. And for the world to heave a huge sigh of relief.

20785,20785,Ann Coulter: How to Provide Universal Health Care Using This One Easy Trick,Ann Coulter,"The first sentence of Congress’ Obamacare repeal should read: “There shall be a free market in health insurance. ”[Right there, I’ve solved the health insurance crisis for 90 percent of Americans. Unfortunately, no one can imagine what a free market in health care looks like because we haven’t had one for nearly a century.  On NBC’s “Meet the Press” this weekend, for example, Chuck Todd told Sen. Tom Cotton that his proposal to create affordable health care that would be widely available, “sounds good,” but “do you understand why some people think that’s an impossible promise to keep?” (The “do you understand   …    ?” formulation is a condescension reserved only for conservatives, whose disagreement with liberals is taken as a sign of stupidity.) Todd continued: “To make it affordable, making it wider, I mean, that just seems like  —   you know, it seems like you’re selling something that can’t be done realistically. ” Dream Sequence: Chuck Todd on Russia’s “Meet the Press” after the fall of the Soviet Union: “Do you understand why some people think that’s an impossible promise to keep? To make bread affordable, making it wider, I mean, that just seems like  —   you know, it seems like you’re selling something that can’t be done realistically. ” It turns out that, outside of a communist dictatorship, all sorts of products are affordable AND widely available! We don’t need Congress to “provide” us with health care any more than we need them to “provide” us with bread. What we need is for health insurance to be available on the free market. With lots of companies competing for your business, basic health insurance would cost about $50 a month. We know the cost because Christian groups got a waiver from Obamacare, and that’s how much their insurance costs right now. (Under the law, it can’t be called “insurance,” but that’s what it is.) Even young, healthy people would buy insurance at that price, expanding the “  pools” and probably bringing the cost down to $20 or $30 a month. In a free market, there would be an endless variety of   plans, from catastrophic care for the   to extravagant plans for the  . You know  —   just like every other product in America. You should visit America sometime, Chuck! The orange juice aisle in a Texas grocery store knocked the socks off Russian president Boris Yeltsin. (Imagine how cheap a double screwdriver must be in America!) Just as there are rows of different types of orange juice in the grocery store  —    and loads of grocery stores  —   there will be loads of health insurance plans and insurance companies offering them. Americans would finally be able to buy whatever insurance plans they liked, as easily as they currently buy   TVs, cellphones and  —   what’s that product with the cute gecko in its commercials? I remember now! CAR INSURANCE! Evidently, insurance is not impervious to the iron law of economics that every product sold on the free market gets better and cheaper over time. The only complicated part of fixing health care is figuring out how to take care of the other 10 percent of Americans  —   the poor, the irresponsible and the unlucky. And the only reason that is complicated is because of fraud. Needless to say, the modern nanny state already guarantees that no one will die on the street in America. The taxpayer spends more than a trillion dollars every year on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security disability insurance so that everyone’s health is taken care of, from cradle to grave. Unfortunately, probably at least half of that sum is fraud. Policing fraud is difficult because: (1) the bureaucrats dispensing government benefits believe there is no fraud and, if there is, it’s a good thing because it redistributes income and (2) we keep bringing in immigrants for whom fraud is a way of life. (See “Adios, America! The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole. ”) Consequently, after the first sentence establishing a free market in health insurance, the entire rest of the bill should be nothing but fraud prevention measures to ensure that only the truly deserving  —   and the truly American  —   are accessing   health care programs. I’d recommend sending as much as possible back to the states, and also paying bounties to anyone who exposes a fraud against Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security. Anyone caught committing health care fraud should get 10 years. Not in prison, in a Medicaid doctor’s waiting room. But I’m sure you guys in Congress have come up with lots of great ideas for policing fraud in the SEVEN YEARS you’ve had to think about it. (Hello? Is he breathing? Dammit, I’m not getting a pulse! !) Then, Congress can start removing all the bad stuff from the U. S. Code, such as:  —   the requirement that hospitals provide “free” care to anyone who shows up (how about separate health clinics for poor people with the sniffles?)  —   the exemption of insurance companies from the antitrust laws (where all our problems began) and,  —   the tax breaks only for   health insurance (viciously and arbitrarily punishing the  ). The goal of “universal health care” is very simple to achieve, just as the goal of “universal wearing of clothing” seems to have been taken care of. The government can provide for those who can’t provide for themselves, but the rest of us need to be allowed to buy health insurance on the free market  —   an innovation that has made America the richest, most   country in the world. It’s taken 50 years, but, thanks to Hillary’s losing the election, we finally have liberals on the record opposing the Soviet Union. Can’t all of Washington come together and end our soviet health care system?",0

20787,20787,Sally Yates Won’t Say If Trump Was Wiretapped - Breitbart,Ian Mason,"Former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates declined to say any Presidential candidates had their communications intercepted by American intelligence during the 2016 campaign Monday. [“Was there any incidental collection, where our intelligence community collects information involving a presidential candidate, on either side of the aisle, during 2015 or 2016,” Sen. Lindsay Graham’s ( ) asked Yates and fellow witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.  Clapper answered that he was not aware of any such collection, but Yates was less categorical. She declined to answer, noting that FBI Director James Comey had done so to the same question and that doing so comported to DOJ policy. “Again you should not draw from that that my answer is yes, but rather that the answer would require me to reveal classified information,” Yates told the Committee. President Donald Trump made headlines with his March allegation that he and his staff had been “wiretapped” at Trump Tower. Senator Graham has expressed his grave concern of the implications if Trump himself had been recorded in intelligence operations conducted under the Obama administration. Graham phrased his initial question to refer also to presidential staff and campaign members, but narrowed his focus the candidates themselves before the witnesses gave their answers. Monday’s hearing was held to discuss the investigation conducted by four U. S. intelligence agencies, and ordered in December by former President Barack Obama, into Russia’s attempts to influence the elections.

20788,20788,Maine’s Gov. LePage Threatens To ‘Investigate’ College Students For Fraud If They Vote (VIDEO),Joe Clark,"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
On Monday, Paul LePage, Maine’s infamous racist Governor, issued a statement which basically threatened any out-of-state student attending college in his state with an investigation should they decide to vote. 
LePage’s statement came on the eve of Election Day, and many believe it was designed to scare Democratic leaning college students away from the polls. 
The governor complained about Democrats encouraging out-of-state students to commit voter fraud by voting in both their home state and the state where they are attending college. He also said that “there is no way to determine” if a person has cast his or her ballot in two states. 
The Washington Post : 
“Democrats for decades have encouraged college students from out of state to vote in Maine, even though there is no way to determine whether these college students also voted in their home states,” LePage said in a statement. 
“Casting ballots in two different states is voter fraud, which is why Maine law requires anyone voting here to establish residency here. We welcome college students establishing residency in our great state, as long as they follow all laws that regulate voting, motor vehicles and taxes. We cannot tolerate voter fraud in our state.” 
LePage continued, “After the election, we will do everything we can that is allowed under state and federal law to verify college students who voted here are following Maine law, which is clearly displayed on the Secretary of State’s website.” 
However, Maine’s Secretary of State, Matthew Dunlap, says that they do have a system in place to detected that kind of voter fraud, and they’ve yet to find evidence of this being a real issue. Dunlap told WMTW ABC 8: 
“People are not voting in two different jurisdictions. In fact, the Secretary of State’s office back in 2011 did just such an investigation of over 200 students who were from out of state, and who had registered and voted in Maine to see if they had voted in their home state, and nobody did.” 
Along with the Governor’s statement, college students at Bates College received a mysterious orange flyer informing them that if they are out of state, students that they must change their driver’s license and re-register their vehicle (which the flyer claimed cost “usually hundreds of dollars in total”). 
The flyer included an official government website address, as well as references to several state statutes regarding the registration of personal motorized vehicles in Maine. College students in Maine: This flyer is FALSE. You may use your dorm as your legal address to vote. pic.twitter.com/jOE6MvH02s 
— Maine College Dems (@MECollegeDem) November 7, 2016 
To the average college student, this flyer would probably seem legit. However, as the above tweet states, college students are allowed to use their dorm address as their permanent residence while attending school in the state. 
Maine’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has requested that the Justice Department step in to investigate. 
“The governor’s statement seems designed to make college students afraid to vote,” Zachary Heiden, legal director at the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement. “Voter intimidation and harassment is illegal, and we call on the Department of Justice to investigate the intent of the governor’s comments. 
“College students who live in Maine have the right to vote in Maine, and they are not subject to different laws than anyone else. Many of these young people are voting for the first time in a presidential election. The governor should be encouraging that civic participation, not doing everything in his power to undermine it.” 
Maine’s Democratic party is calling this a classic case of GOP voter suppression efforts aimed at minority groups whom they feel will vote Democratic. 
“The false information contained in these fliers is a deliberate attempt to suppress the millennial vote,” Maine Democratic Party Chairman Phil Bartlett said in a statement. “There is nothing in Maine law that states that college students must change their driver’s licenses in order to vote. 
“In fact, the Secretary of State’s office has made explicitly clear that a dorm can be a student’s legal voting residence, and that paying out-of-state tuition does not preclude a student from voting. Maine also has same-day voter registration, so students who are not registered to vote in Maine can still register on Election Day. We urge all Bates students to spread the word to their fellow classmates about their voting rights here in Maine.” 
Despite their best efforts, numerous states are reporting record turnout numbers, which traditionally doesn’t bode well for Republicans who prefer low voter turnout for any group that’s isn’t non-educated, white, and male.

20789,20789,Sen. McConnell: The Supreme Court Vacancy Was Key to President Trump’s Win - Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R, KY) recently insisted that the open seat on the U. S. Supreme Court just filled by Justice Neil Gorsuch was a key factor in President Donald Trump’s White House victory last November. [Speaking of the the Supreme Court vacancy, Sen. McConnell told the Washington Examiner, “At the end, this issue more than any other elected Donald Trump, because, at the end, you had two candidates who were overwhelmingly unpopular. ”  McConnell noted that blocking President Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court seat suddenly left vacant after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of 2016 was important. As Obama’s remaining months in office wound down last year, he made the uncommon move of nominating a replacement for Scalia instead of waiting for the results of the   election and allowing the next president to make a nomination. As leader of the Senate, McConnell decided not to allow the Garland nomination to move forward, arguing that since the election was so close, the next president  —   whether it be Trump or Clinton  —   should be allowed the nomination. According to McConnell, the possibility that a Republican could get the next nomination energized the drive to elect Trump. “Nobody was predicting Trump would get 90 percent of the Republican vote just like Mitt Romney did [in 2012,] but he did,” McConnell said. “And the single biggest reason was, they wanted him to make the Supreme Court appointment, not Hillary Clinton. ” “This call was made in February,” McConnell concluded. “We didn’t know who our nominee was going to be yet. What I did not predict was that we would nominate somebody who a lot of Republicans questioned whether he was a Republican. I mean, after all, Donald Trump was having fundraisers for [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer four or five years ago. ” Before his election, Donald Trump met with several groups of conservatives and asked for their recommendation as to whom he should pick for the Supreme Court and then made the unusual move of publicizing his list of possible picks. Trump’s move brought in many voices of support for his campaign that he may not otherwise have won.

20790,20790,Nikki Haley Blasts U.N. Human Rights Office for ‘Unfair Bias’ Against Israel in Latest Report,Adam Shaw,"U. S Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has blasted a new U. N. report that attacks Israeli actions in the Middle East, in what she says is the latest sign of the U. N.’s “unfair bias” in how it handles the   conflict. [The report, from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, was submitted in response to a resolution by the Human Rights Council  —   a body which Haley has repeatedly criticized for its own   bias and the questionable human rights record of some of its members.  The report, titled, “Ensuring accountability and justice for all violations of international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem,” evaluates Israel’s compliance with a number of U. N. resolutions and reports, including demands to deconstruct its security barrier on the West Bank, which has been credited with massively reducing terrorist attacks. The report adds: The High Commissioner notes the repeated failure to comply with the calls for accountability made by the entire human rights system and urges Israel to conduct prompt, impartial and independent investigations of all alleged violations of international human rights law and all allegations of international crimes. Furthermore, the High Commissioner calls upon Israel to ensure that all victims have access to remedies and reparation. The report also notes previous recommendations, including an   boycott call for “investigations of the activities of companies and financial institutions profiting from Israeli settlements, and for such practices to be ended and for reparation to be provided to Palestinians affected. ” Haley took issue with the report’s focus on Israel, noting that it “brushed over” terror attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups attacking Israel, and ignored the human rights abuses of other countries. “This report is just the latest example of the Human Rights Council singling out Israel rather than focusing on the world’s actual human rights abusers,” she said in a statement. “Not only does it undermine the credibility of the Human Rights Council on human rights issues, but it once again highlights the unfair bias of the UN when it comes to the   conflict,” she said. Haley also took issue with the recommendation that the U. N. General Assembly ask the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on Israel, something her office says is out of the purview of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Israel’s Ambassador to the U. N. Danny Danon also condemned the report, saying, “This obsession with Israel has crossed all lines. ” Danon accused the office of offering to “advise and support” efforts to create what he called a “blacklist” database of companies working in the region so that the international community could threaten a boycott. The latest report comes a week after Haley visited the Human Rights Council’s headquarters in Geneva and warned that the U. S. could leave the council if it didn’t reform its voting and bias against America’s ally in the Middle East. The same week, Breitbart News reported on an upcoming report by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia and submitted in the name of Secretary General Antonio Guterres, blaming Israeli settlements for a host of Palestinian grievances for everything from excessive use of force to building parks in the West Bank so as to “entrench” Israel’s presence.

20791,20791,Lawyer Who Kept Hillary Campaign Chief Out of Jail in DOJ Hillary Probe,Daniel Greenfield,"Lawyer Who Kept Hillary Campaign Chief Out of Jail in DOJ Hillary Probe November 1, 2016 Daniel Greenfield 
Peter Kadzik kept Hillary's campaign chief out of jail. And he hopes to do the same for her. 
Hillary's people have gone on the warpath against the FBI. Their allies are Obama's political appointees at the DOJ. And this is who is in their corner. 
The Justice Department official in charge of informing Congress about the newly reactivated Hillary Clinton email probe is a political appointee and former private-practice lawyer who kept Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta “out of jail,” lobbied for a tax cheat later pardoned by President Bill Clinton and led the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. 
Peter Kadzik, who was confirmed as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs in June 2014, represented Podesta in 1998 when independent counsel Kenneth Starr was investigating Podesta for his possible role in helping ex-Bill Clinton intern and mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. 
“Fantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,” Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta’s Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. 
Kadzik’s name has surfaced multiple times in regard to the FBI’s investigation of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for using a private, homebrewed server. After FBI Director James Comey informed Congress on Thursday the FBI was reviving its inquiry when new evidence linked to a separate investigation was discovered, congressional leaders wrote to the Department of Justice seeking more information. Kadzik replied. 
“We assure you that the Department will continue to work closely with the FBI and together, dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible,” Kadzik wrote on Oct. 31. 
Kadzik had been an attorney with Dickstein Shapiro LLP for 18 years before he represented Podesta in the Clinton/Lewinsky investigation. He was hired in 2000 as a lobbyist for tax cheat Marc Rich, who was controversially granted a pardon by President Bill Clinton during Clinton’s final days in office. Kadzik got the job “because he was ‘trusted by [White House Chief of Staff John] Podesta,’ and was considered to be a ‘useful person to convey [Marc Rich’s] arguments to Mr. Podesta,’” according to a 2002 House Oversight Committee report. 
Marc Rich? Funny you should mention his name. FBI boss Comey was the prosecutor in that case. And the FBI recently released material from the investigation into that case. 
So there's a lot of Clinton history coming full circle here.",1
20792,20792,"Jakarta Bombing Kills Three Police Officers, Linked to Islamic State",John Hayward,"Two suicide bombers attacked a bus station in Jakarta on Wednesday, killing three police officers and wounding at least a dozen people. The Indonesian government believes the Islamic State was responsible. [The attack was carried out in the Kampung Melayu area of Indonesia’s capital by a pair of suicide bombers who detonated themselves about five minutes apart, according to Reuters.  The New York Times noted that the large police presence at the bus station was due to a parade, part of Jakarta’s festivities leading up to the beginning of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan on Saturday. Another possible factor in the timing of the attack was the formal resignation of Jakarta governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese heritage who is currently serving a   jail sentence for blasphemy against Islam. Ahok’s trial and conviction inflamed both racial and religious tensions. He abandoned his appeal against the blasphemy sentence on Tuesday and resigned his office on Wednesday. In addition to the Ramadan parade, the New York Times noted that “thousands of   Muslims” celebrated the governor’s resignation on the streets in the hours leading up to the suicide bomb attack. Another theory, advanced on Indonesian television by National Police spokesman Awi Setyono, is that Indonesian extremists might have been “triggered” by the ongoing clash between ISIS forces and the government of the Philippines, and by the bombing of the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. “These victims are known to us. They are police. They are bus drivers. They are motorcycle taxi drivers and grocers. I have ordered the police to hunt the terrorists and get to the root of this attack,” declared Indonesian President Joko Widodo. Widodo advised citizens to “keep calm and keep cool” because “we Muslims are preparing to enter the month of Ramadan for fasting. ” He ordered police to “thoroughly investigate the networks of the perpetrators and hunt them to the roots. ” Although no group has made a formal claim of responsibility, ISIS involvement is suspected by both Indonesian officials and analysts. “The Islamic State remains the main driver of attacks in Indonesia, and the threat posed by militants linked to the group is likely to escalate in the country,” Jane’s Terrorism and Insurgency Center analyst Otso Iho told CNN. Iho noted that “experienced militants” who fought for ISIS in Iraq and Syria are returning to their home countries, increasing the threat level dramatically. Only a few hundred Indonesians are believed to have traveled to the “caliphate” to fight for ISIS, but the terror state’s recruiting efforts in the world’s largest Muslim nation have been disturbingly effective with potential homegrown operatives. Indonesian police said the weapons appeared to be   bombs carried in backpacks. A police inspector said that “aluminum, nails, buckshot, and receipts for purchasing rice cookers” were found at the scene of the attack. The Associated Press reports that Indonesian   squads raided two houses believed to be owned by the bombers, identified as Ichwanul Nurul Salam, 40, and Ahmad Sukri, 32. Several of their relatives were also taken in for “questioning and DNA tests,” according to the chief of the   squad. Salam’s wife reportedly told investigators that the bombs were assembled by another militant known as “Agus,” who is now sought by police and considered “at large and dangerous. ” A similar bomb, also believed to have been designed by Agus, was detonated in February by a member of an Indonesian extremist network called Jemaah Anshorut Daulah that has pledged allegiance to ISIS.",0
20793,20793,Idiot Who Destroyed Trump Hollywood Star Gets EXACTLY What He Deserves,Robert Rich,"Share This 
Although the vandal who thought it was “cool” to destroy Donald Trump’s Hollywood star looked pretty comfortable making a video from the comfort of his own home, that can’t be said for him today. In fact, it seems that the idiot just got exactly what he deserved – and that’s not even the real kicker. 
Yesterday, Mad World News reported on James Otis, the man who was recorded destroying Trump’s star on Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California and stealing the two plaques that were in the concrete. Of course, he later stated that the two stolen objects would be auctioned off on election day with the proceeds promised to Trump’s so-called “victims.” 
Proving to be a cocky moron, Otis gave an itinerary, saying that he wanted to deliver a few remarks at the location of his crime at 9:30 this morning. Unfortunately for him, things didn’t go according to plan as the man just got exactly what he deserved. Donald Trump’s Hollywood star before (left) and after (right) James Otis destroyed it 
Although Otis had promised to turn himself in today, Deadline reports that police tracked him down and arrested him before he could use the incident to further himself any more. Unfortunately for him, the news got even worse when he was officially slapped with a felony vandalism charge. Oh, and that little “auction” he was going to have isn’t going to happen since police confiscated at least one of the plaques, which they found stashed in Otis’s car: Police confiscated at least one part of the plaque (Source: TMZ ) 
The real kicker came next, though. Since damages were valued at over $400 , Otis is facing up to 3 years in jail and more than $10,000 in fines. Of course, Otis didn’t seem to mind facing the consequences – until, that is, he heard what he’d actually earned. James Otis 
In fact, he only made himself out to be more of an idiot during an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News when he said, “I was just so fed up, so saddened and fed up by Mr. Trump and how he continues to denigrate women, and he continues to joke and make fun about sexual violence and his own exploits against women.” 
Clearly uninformed on the truth, he then added , “It’s just a big joke to him. I have children; I have many women in my life who don’t think it’s a joke. But he does.” He continued, “He lies about it, he shuffles and I don’t see, there’s no reason to believe at all that it will ever stop now. He’ll continue to do this, he’ll continue to make women suffer. So that’s what I’d tell him. “You need help. Please understand that.” Trump’s star is already being repaired (Source: Breitbart ) 
Otis doesn’t even understand that what he did wasn’t really any big deal. As of right now, the star is being replaced. Furthermore, destroying that property didn’t do a darn thing to Trump since it wasn’t his property – it was the states. In short, he just cost the American taxpayer more money because now we have to fix it. 
That’s the problem with the entitled mentality these days – it doesn’t matter to them who they hurt in the process. Of course, coming off looking like an idiot sure can’t feel good, but he’ll get a nice long time to think about that while he’s rotting in prison for a few years.",1
20794,20794,Trump: Putin ’Very Smart’ to Not Retaliate over Obama Sanctions - Breitbart,Lee Stranahan,"Donald Trump took to Twitter Friday to praise Vladimir Putin for his decision to delay his response to President Obama’s new sanctions against Russia for the country’s alleged interference in the 2016 U. S. election. [Great move on delay (by V. Putin)  —   I always knew he was very smart!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2016,   Russian President Vladimir Putin said Russia would not seek the expulsion of U. S. diplomats, but condemned the U. S. sanctions against Russia, calling them a “provocation aimed to further undermine   relations. ” President Obama’s retaliation, including the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, comes just three weeks shy of   Donald Trump being sworn in as President. Media outlets like NBC News have reported that the “CIA has concluded that the interference was intended to help Donald Trump win, and NBC News has reported that intelligence officials believe ‘with a high level of confidence’ that Putin was personally involved,” but neither the intelligence community nor the Obama administration has produced any substantive proof that clearly links the Russian government to the hacking. Given Obama’s executive order of sanctions against Russia, the lack of public disclosure of any proven link between Russian intelligence or Vladimir Putin and the hacking is troubling, but adding to the lack of accountability is the fact that members of the House Intelligence committee have also been stonewalled by the Obama administration. As Breitbart News reported on Thursday, a source with knowledge on this matter told Breitbart that members of the committee were told they had to wait for an Obama   report to Congress to be issued first. Reuters reported that Senator Ron Johnson said, “It is disappointing that the CIA would provide information on this issue to the Washington Post and NBC but will not provide information to elected members of Congress” after being denied a briefing by the CIA. Russia has repeatedly denied the hacking charges. At a press conference Thursday, a spokesman for Vladimir Putin called Obama’s executive order “unpredictable” and “aggressive” and said they believed the Obama administration’s action were meant “to further harm   ties, which are at a low point as it is, as well as, obviously, to deal a blow to the foreign policy plans of the incoming administration of the  . ”   Trump said many times during the election that he favored a better relationship with Russia, including working with them to defeat ISIS.

20796,20796,"N.F.L. Playoffs: Schedule, Matchups and Odds - The New York Times",Benjamin Hoffman,"When the Green Bay Packers lost to the Washington Redskins in Week 11, dropping to   Aaron Rodgers vowed to “run the table” in a march to the playoffs. With a   victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night, the team fulfilled Rodgers’ promise. Much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the Redskins lost to the Giants, thus guaranteeing both the Packers and Lions would be playoff teams, but the N. F. C. North bragging rights, and a home game in the first round of the playoffs, were sufficient motivation for Green Bay to push hard enough to secure the team’s sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for Detroit. Pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams. But when all was said and done, ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order. No. 6 Detroit Lions at No. 3 Seattle Seahawks Time: 8:15 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on NBC The Seahawks’ title hopes took a crushing blow when Earl Thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg. After the injury, the Seahawks went   with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the   Rams and 49ers. That collapse paled in comparison to the Lions, who lost their final three games, blowing what had been a large division lead against Green Bay. Line: Seahawks   ( : 43) No. 5 Giants at No. 4 Green Bay Packers Time: 4:40 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on Fox Thanks to playing in the N. F. C. East, home of the   Dallas Cowboys, the Giants managed to tie Atlanta for the   record in the N. F. C. but got stuck with the No. 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a   Packers squad that won its final six games. The good news for the Giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the Packers on the road in the playoffs, they not only won the games but went on to win the Super Bowl both times. Line: Packers   ( : 44. 5) Bye weeks: Dallas, Atlanta No. 5 Oakland Raiders at No. 4 Houston Texans Time: 4:35 p. m. Eastern SATURDAY on ESPN Line: Texans   ( : 37) The Texans were the least inspiring of the N. F. L. ’s division champions and that was complicated further when Tom Savage, whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of Brock Osweiler, was forced to leave Week 17’s loss to Tennessee with a concussion. As bad as that sounds, it may still be enough against a reeling Oakland squad that lost Derek Carr to a broken leg in Week 16, Matt McGloin to a shoulder injury in Week 17, and fell all the way from the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. to No. 5. It is unclear at this point if McGloin or rookie Connor Cook will start at quarterback against Houston. No. 6 Miami Dolphins at No. 3 Pittsburgh Steelers Time: 1:05 p. m. Eastern SUNDAY on CBS The Dolphins were a contender when the team’s quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, was lost in Week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee. Thanks to backup quarterback Matt Moore, and Jay Ajayi, the team’s   running back, they won two of three games and secured a   berth. But going up against a   offense like Pittsburgh is a tough test for Miami’s middling defense, even if Tannehill’s knee heals enough to allow him to return. Line: Steelers  .5 ( : 47. 5) Bye weeks: New England, Kansas City With four teams vying for two N. F. C. playoff spots, all eyes were on the   game on Sunday. A Redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings, with the Lions and Packers playing a     evening matchup. The Giants, who had already locked up the No. 5 seed and had nothing to gain, threw a wrench in the Redskins’ plans, eliminating their division rivals with a decisive   victory. With the drama essentially taken out of the N. F. C. all of the playoff movement Sunday occurred in the A. F. C. where there was a   at the top of the standings in the A. F. C. West. Just a week after losing Derek Carr, the team’s quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player, to a broken leg, the Oakland Raiders were crushed   by the Denver Broncos. That, combined with the Kansas City Chiefs’   victory over the San Diego Chargers vaulted the Chiefs from a   spot all the way to the No. 2 seed in the A. F. C. which comes with a   bye in the playoffs. The loss for Oakland added to the misery of the Raiders, who have gone from Super Bowl contenders last week to a   team that will play on the road in Houston next week potentially with a   quarterback under center as Carr’s backup, Matt McGloin, injured his shoulder in the loss to the Broncos. Beyond the switch to the Chiefs as the No.   in the A. F. C. it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs. The New England Patriots secured the No. 1 spot in the A. F. C. with a win over Miami, the Dallas Cowboys were already guaranteed the No. 1 spot in the N. F. C. before their loss to Philadelphia, and the Atlanta Falcons held onto the No. 2 seed in the N. F. C. with a   win over New Orleans. The only remaining chance for a minor   was for the Packers, who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker, to lose to the Lions, which would have forced them to play on the road in the   round of the playoffs. But the    aspect of the de facto N. F. C. North championship went away when the Redskins lost to the Giants, which eliminated the Redskins from   contention. While most of the races were straight forward, one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs. They simply had to shoot the moon by beating the Carolina Panthers, having the Redskins tie the Giants, the Packers lose to the Lions, and should all of that happen they simply required wins by Indianapolis, Dallas, Tennessee and San Francisco to top the Packers in strength of schedule. Tampa Bay took care of their end by beating the Panthers early in the day, but they were eliminated officially when Dallas lost to Philadelphia.",0
20797,20797,Macy’s Is Said to Receive Takeover Approach by Hudson’s Bay - The New York Times,Michael J. de la Merced and Rachel Abrams,"The Macy’s of today grew from the union of several great names in American retailing, including its namesake chain, Bloomingdale’s and Marshall Field’s. But the ambitious owner of Saks Fifth Avenue has broached the idea of taking the union even further, combining with Macy’s to create a department store juggernaut at a time when the industry is reeling. Hudson’s Bay Company, the Canadian owner of Saks, has approached Macy’s about a potential takeover, people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly said on Friday. Talks between the two companies are at an early stage and may still fall apart or lead to a partnership of some kind rather than a sale. While it is unclear whether a deal will happen, a combination could lift the fortunes of Macy’s, the country’s biggest department store, which has been struggling. Investors certainly appeared to see it that way. Shares of Macy’s rose as much as 12 percent on Friday, its biggest intraday gain since Aug. 11, according to data from Bloomberg. Once a retail titan, Macy’s has struggled to remain relevant as   and discount retailers have decimated the traditional    business. Last month, Macy’s announced plans to cut more than 10, 000 jobs and close some of its 880 stores. Terry Lundgren, its chief executive and the architect of Macy’s last big merger, is expected to step down by the end of March. He will be succeeded by the company’s president, Jeffrey Gennette. Since the recession, shoppers have grown accustomed to hunt for bargains and to not pay full price. Discount stores and outlet malls have flourished. Traditional stores have been compelled to respond by trimming prices, which cuts into their margins. Departments stores have been hit especially hard, particularly as shoppers migrate away from malls. What has emerged, analysts say, is a virtual race to the bottom. That has been particularly difficult for Macy’s, born of a series of mergers over the past two decades that made it a juggernaut in the industry. A stalwart of the middle tier of retail, the company has neither the advantages of   retailers like HM nor the   stores. In addition, Macy’s faces increasingly fierce competition online from sites like Amazon and elsewhere. Macy’s troubles have drawn the attention of a prominent activist hedge fund, Starboard Value, which has urged the company to generate cash by selling the real estate beneath its stores. Starboard, which held just under 1 percent of Macy’s shares as of Sept. 30, had previously estimated the value of that land at about $21 billion. On Friday, analysts at Citigroup estimated that Macy’s   holdings could be worth at least $18 billion. Macy’s market value, by comparison, was just under $11 billion as of Friday morning. Macy’s has taken some steps to sell or redevelop stores, and last year, it added an expert on real estate transactions to its board. But the company has largely resisted more ambitious efforts to divest its real estate, including     deals, in which a company sells the underlying land beneath its stores and then rents it back. The company’s suitor, Hudson’s Bay Company, is far smaller  —   its market value was about 1. 9 billion Canadian dollars, or $1. 5 billion  —   but is known for its bold steps. Hudson’s Bay Company has assembled a growing empire that includes the Hudson’s Bay department store chain, Lord  Taylor and its crown jewel, Saks. And the governor and executive chairman of the Hudson’s Bay Company, Richard Baker, has shown little fear of using debt: In November 2014, the company borrowed nearly $4 billion against the Saks flagship in Midtown Manhattan. He has spoken often of retailers’ need to highlight the value of their real estate. Financing a bid for Macy’s may be trickier, however, because the it carries about $6. 5 billion in   debt. That may mean that the Hudson’s Bay Company will have to bring in a partner or borrow against more of its real estate holdings. A spokesman for the Hudson’s Bay Company declined to comment on the talks, which were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. “We do not comment on rumors and speculation,” a representative for Macy’s said. A representative for Starboard Value did not respond to a request for comment. Some analysts said that they saw the merit of a potential combination, particularly given Macy’s operational woes and Mr. Baker’s expertise in wringing money out of real estate. “There is a clear logic, despite disparity in   cap” between Macy’s and Hudson’s Bay Company, Craig Johnson, the president of Customer Growth Partners, a research firm, said in a note. Referring to Macy’s stock ticker symbol, he added, “The retail market has been changing faster than M has been able to keep up with, whether the flight from the mall or the migration online. ”",0

The five-day NATO drill in Montenegro started on Monday and involves responding to floods and chemical attacks. It will involve 680 unarmed personnel from seven NATO countries and 10 partner states. 
In the past both Serbia and Montenegro were constitutional republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
Both countries are socialist republics and traditional Russian Christian Orthodox allies. In 2003 this state union was re-formed into Serbia and Montenegro, and in 2006 the two became independent states. 
Since their split, the two Balkan neighbors seem to have headed in different directions strategically. 
Montenegro has taken a pro-Western stance which has been awarded by NATO with an offer to join the Northern Atlantic Alliance. 
The NATO invitation to Montenegro has met strong opposition from Russia. 
Meanwhile, Montenegrin officials have accused Russia of staging an alleged coup in October to topple its pro-Western government because of the NATO accession bid. 
Serbia, a NATO partner, has held exercises with the Western alliance, but not such a large one or with foreign troops and equipment participating on its soil.",1

by David Swanson 
Imagine if a local business in your town invented a brand new tool that was intended to have an almost magical effect thousands of miles away. However, where the tool was kept and used locally became an area unsafe for children. Children who got near this tool tended to have increased blood pressure and increased stress hormones, lower reading skills, poorer memories, impaired auditory and speech perception, and impaired academic performance. 
Most of us would find this situation at least a little concerning, unless the new invention was designed to murder lots of people. Then it’d be just fine. 
Now, imagine if this same new tool ruined neighborhoods because people couldn’t safely live near it. Imagine if the government had to compensate people but kick them out of living near the location of this tool. Again, I think, we might find that troubling if mass murder were not the mission. 
Imagine also that this tool fairly frequently explodes, emitting highly toxic chemicals, particles, and fibers unsafe to breathe into the air for miles around. Normally, that’d be a problem. But if this tool is needed for killing lots of people, we’ll work with its flaws, won’t we? 
Now, what if this new gadget was expected to cost at least $1,400,000,000,000 over 50 years? And what if that money had to be taken away from numerous other expenses more beneficial for the economy and the world? What if the $1.4 trillion was drained out of the economy causing a loss of jobs and a radical diminuition of resources for education, healthcare, housing, environmental protection, or humanitarian aid? Wouldn’t that be a worry in some cases, I mean in those cases where the ability to kill tons of human beings wasn’t at stake? 
What if this product, even when working perfectly, was a leading destroyer of the earth’s natural environment? 
What if this high-tech toy wasn’t even designed to do what was expected of it and wasn’t even able to do what it was designed for? 
Amazingly, even those shortcomings do not matter as long as the intention is massive murder and destruction. Then, all is forgiven. 
The tool I’m describing is called the F-35. At RootsAction.org you can find a new petition launched by locally-minded people acting globally in places where the F-35 is intended to be based. Also at that link you’ll find explanations of how the tool I’ve been decribing is the F-35. 
The petition is directed to the United States Congress and the governments of Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan and South Korea from the world and from the people of Burlington, Vermont, and Fairbanks, Alaska, where the F-35 is to be based. This effort is being initiated by Vermont Stop the F35 Coalition, Save Our Skies Vermont, Western Maine Matters, Alaska Peace Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks Peace Club, North Star Chapter 146 Veterans For Peace, World Beyond War, RootsAction.org, Code Pink, and Ben Cohen. 
The petition reads: 
The F-35 is a weapon of offensive war, serving no defensive purpose. It is planned to cost the U.S. $1.4 trillion over 50 years. Because starvation on earth could be ended for $30 billion and the lack of clean drinking water for $11 billion per year, it is first and foremost through the wasting of resources that this airplane will kill. Military spending, contrary to popular misconception, also hurts the U.S. economy ( see here ) and other economies. The F-35 causes negative health impacts and cognitive impairment in children living near its bases. It renders housing near airports unsuitable for residential use. It has a high crash rate and horrible consequences to those living in the area of its crashes. Its emissions are a major environmental polluter. 
Wars are endangering the United States and other participating nations rather than protecting them. Nonviolent tools of law, diplomacy, aid, crisis prevention, and verifiable nuclear disarmament should be substituted for continuing counterproductive wars. Therefore, we, the undersigned, call for the immediate cancellation of the F-35 program as a whole, and the immediate cancellation of plans to base any such dangerous and noisy jets near populated areas. We oppose replacing the F-35 with any other weapon or basing the F-35 in any other locations. We further demand redirection of the money for the F-35 back into taxpayers’ pockets, and into environmental and human needs in the U.S., other F-35 customer nations, and around the world, including to fight climate change, pay off student debt, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, and improve education, healthcare, and housing.
